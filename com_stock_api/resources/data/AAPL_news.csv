Xiaomi Chief Executive Lei Jun made the announcement in a letter posted on the company s social media account on Thursday, but did not provide specific investment details.
""We need to turn our continuous advantage we have in AIoT and intelligent life into absolute victory in intelligent full scene, and completely cement our king status in the smart era,"" Lei said, using the acronym for artificial intelligence of things, a reference to a combination of AI and internet technologies.
The announced investment increases Xiaomi s pledge made last year to invest 10 billion yuan over five years in an ""All in AIoT"" strategy.
The Beijing-based company started as an affordable cellphone maker but its internet-enabled products now include smart TVs and rice-cookers.
However, Xiaomi also faces intense competition in its home market from rival Huawei Technologies, which captured a record 42% of China s smartphone market in the third quarter at the expense of other local manufacturers and Apple .
Lei announced in October the company planned to launch more than 10 5G phone models in 2020."

(Bloomberg) -- Stocks started the year on the front foot, building on strong gains for many asset classes in 2019 as investors cheered the latest policy move by China’s central bank to support its economy. Treasuries and the dollar strengthened.

The S&P 500 jumped 0.8% to a record on the year’s first trading day, with megacaps Apple Inc , Alphabet  Inc Class C  and   Nike   Inc  notching all-time highs. It was among the best starts for U.S. stocks in the past decade, though first-day performance has virtually no bearing on how the year plays out. Tech shares led gains, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc  surging 7% after an upgrade. Small caps underperformed, with the Russell 2000 sliding 0.1%.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced as every sector finished in the green. Gauges in Hong Kong and Shanghai jumped more than 1% after the People’s Bank of China said it will increase the supply of cheap funding to banks, in line with market expectations.
“You’ve had a good liquidity-driven momentum-type rally toward year end and that momentum is carrying on in and of itself,” said Kevin Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors.
The euro fell as data showed the region’s manufacturing downturn deepened in December. The dollar stayed higher as U.S. jobless claims dropped to a four-week low, while the pound weakened following its best quarter in a decade.
After a stellar 2019 across most major assets, focus now shifts to the year ahead. Thursday gave investors the latest read on Chinese manufacturing, with the Caixin PMI dipping slightly from its November level but remaining well in the expansionary zone. On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this week said he expects to sign the first phase of a deal with China on Jan. 15, though Beijing has yet to confirm the date.
“Good start to the year -- China gave the markets a little jolt to start the year with a liquidity injection into their market,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The message is that central banks are going to continue to help sustain growth or actually try to generate more growth in the markets and interest rates will stay low.”
Investors are also keeping an eye on geopolitical tensions, including in North Korea, where Kim Jong Un said he was no longer bound by his pledge to halt major missile tests and would soon debut a “new strategic weapon.” In Baghdad, an Iran-backed Iraqi militia broke up its encampment outside the U.S. embassy after an attack on the compound threatened to spiral into a broader confrontation.
Elsewhere, crude oil pared an earlier advance, while gold climbed. The Thai baht fell as much as 1.8% overnight, its biggest drop since 2007, amid speculation the Bank of Thailand could be intervening to curb the currency’s strength.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street s major indexes notched record highs to open the new year on Thursday, as fresh economic stimulus from China added to optimism fueled by easing trade tensions and an improving global outlook.
China s central bank said on Wednesday it would cut the amount of cash that all banks must hold as reserves, the eighth such cut since early 2018. The move to inject fresh stimulus into the Chinese economy boosted equity markets around the globe.
The benchmark S&P 500 hit its 11th record high in 14 sessions and posted its largest daily percentage gain in three weeks. The Dow registered its biggest such gain in almost four weeks, and the Nasdaq its greatest in nearly three months.
Economic stimulus in China, along with the easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, has bolstered optimism that the global economy will accelerate in 2020.
""The market s been up all day because of the news that China is out there with monetary easing,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""With the trade deal as a backdrop, it s a positive factor.""
Among the S&P 500 s sectors, technology (SPLRCT) and industrials (SPLRCI), both of which have high exposure to the Chinese economy, rose more than 1% and led in percentage gains. Shares of Apple Inc , which have been a bellwether of trade sentiment, ended 2.3% higher and surpassed $300.
The lengthy rally on Wall Street has prompted some concerns that U.S. stocks are vulnerable to a pullback, especially if economic growth does not pick up as much as expected or if U.S.-China trade tensions reignite.
""Large-cap equities are priced for perfection,"" said Peter Cecchini, global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ""It feels like we re wildly overbought given the risks that we see.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 330.36 points, or 1.16%, to 28,868.8, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 27.07 points, or 0.84%, to 3,257.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 119.59 points, or 1.33%, to 9,092.19.
Adding to positive economic sentiment, data from the U.S. Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits edged lower last week.
Other data from Greater China showing that gross gaming revenue in Macau fell less than expected in December boosted shares of U.S. casino operators. Shares of  Wynn Resorts Ltd  ,  Las Vegas Sands  Corp  and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd  rose between 2% and 4%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Investors on Friday will get the latest read on the health of the world’s biggest economy, with U.S. ISM manufacturing data due following jobs data showing the labor market remains robust. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this week said he expects to sign the first phase of a trade deal with China on Jan. 15, though Beijing has yet to confirm the date.“We will likely see continued gains given that we’ve had a lot of the tensions and challenges that were facing us in 2019 lift,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, told Bloomberg TV. “You have that central bank liquidity.

Phil Hogan will meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss disputes including an American threat to hit $2.4 billion of French goods with tariffs in retaliation over a digital-services tax in France.
The U.S. alleged on Dec. 2 -- the day after Hogan became EU trade commissioner -- that France’s tax discriminates against U.S. technology companies such as Google , Apple Inc . and Amazon.com Inc .
Such levies would mark the first time President Donald Trump’s administration deploys against Europe a policy tool -- Section 301 of a 1974 American law -- reserved so far for the U.S. trade war against China. The prospect has alarmed the EU, which is already scrambling to expand its policy arsenal in response to a separate U.S. threat to the rules-based international system.
“The only acceptable route to address trade disputes is through the World Trade Organization adjudication process,” Hogan told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France on Dec. 19. “The European Union will act -- and react -- as one against any unilateral measures outside the multilateral trading system.”
Ties between the EU and U.S., the world’s biggest economic partners, have deteriorated on numerous fronts since Trump took office in January 2017 with an “America First” agenda that has shaken the global order put in place with American support after the Second World War.
Hogan’s visit would overlap with another important date on the U.S. administration’s calendar. Trump has said he plans to sign phase one of a trade deal with China on Jan. 15 in the U.S. capital.
While the transatlantic tensions extend to decisions by Trump to abandon major international agreements to fight climate change, control nuclear arms in Europe and curb Iran’s atomic-energy program, the EU’s sore points with the U.S. over trade go well beyond possible American retaliatory tariffs tied to France’s digital tax.

(Reuters) - German automotive supplier Robert Bosch said Thursday it has developed a sensor that lets cars ""see"" a three-dimensional view of the road, aiming to lower the cost of technology that could speed the development of self-driving vehicles.
Privately-held Bosch said the internally-developed lidar sensor, which it will show at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, will cover both long and close ranges on highways and in the city and will work in conjunction with the company s camera and radar technologies.
Lidar technology, which uses light-based sensors to generate a three-dimensional view of the road, remains a relatively young technology that is still in flux. In its current form, it is too expensive for mass market use, but if a cheaper lidar sensor were widely adopted, it could provide more depth data that would allow self-driving cars to detect the distance to other road users like pedestrians.
While numerous start-ups are working on lidar, the involvement of large and trusted suppliers like Bosch could help speed adoption of the technology.
""Bosch is making automated driving a viable possibility in the first place,"" Bosch management board member Harald Kroeger said in a statement.
Initially using bulky spinning devices placed on the roof of cars, lidar developers have transitioned to more compact solid-state devices that can be mounted on other parts of a car, such as near the headlights. These now sell for less than $10,000 in limited quantities, but analysts say they must sell for as little as $200 in mass production to become commercially viable.
Bosch did not provide a timeline, pricing or technology details for its lidar, but a spokesman said the company is working on making the sensors ""production ready"" and the focus will be on ""affordable mass market"" technology.
The spokesman declined to say whether Bosch already had auto customers for the sensor.
The development of self-driving cars has hit a speed bump as costs and regulatory concerns cause automakers and tech companies to rethink their plans.
Lidar is currently used by companies including General Motors Co ,  Ford Motor Co   and Alphabet Inc s  Waymo. Apple Inc  also is evaluating the technology.
Others are less enthusiastic about adopting lidar, citing a high cost and limited capabilities - including Elon Musk s Tesla Inc  and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201).
Last April, Musk called lidar ""a fool s errand"" that was too costly and said anyone relying on the technology was ""doomed."" Tesla vehicles rely on cameras and radars as their vision system for self-driving.
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in lidar start-ups over the last few years.
Other major suppliers developing the technology include  Valeo  , Aptiv , and Continental . Last July, Valeo said it had won 500 million euros ($560 million)worth of orders for its lidar sensor products.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will send a big contingent of senior officials to an annual technology gathering in Las Vegas next week as the tech industry faces increased scrutiny in Washington.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, White House adviser Ivanka Trump, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios will be among more than 150 other government officials from the United States and around the world will attend CES, the annual tech industry event. In prior years, the event has drawn fewer senior U.S. officials -- typically just one cabinet official -- and did not draw any in 2019 because of a government shutdown.
The event, which runs from Jan. 7-10, draws more 175,000 visitors and 4,500 companies exhibiting new technologies, including airlines, automakers, battery manufacturers and hundreds of tech start-ups. 
The White House has touted technology improvements as a way to boost U.S. employment and is working to ease regulatory barriers to advanced technologies like drones and self-driving cars. At the same time, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing whether big tech firms like  Facebook Inc  , Alphabet  Inc, Amazon.com  and Apple Inc  are violating antitrust laws.
The largest tech firms generally skip CES in favor of holding their own events.
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joseph Simons will speak at a fireside chat, and three of the other four FCC commissioners will attend as will two other FTC commissioners.
Pai has proposed shifting part of a block spectrum set aside for auto safety to accommodate the rapidly growing number of wireless devices. Numerous companies are displaying new wireless devices at CES. Chao is expected to talk about self-driving car policies.
Elena Hernandez, spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said Friday that Kratsios will be at CES to discuss the administration s national strategy for artificial intelligence launched in 2018.
""Recognizing the significance of technology on the American workforce, our national security, and the U.S. economy, the Trump administration continues to make leadership in the cutting-edge industries of the future a top priority,"" Hernandez said.
President Donald Trump, who has had strained relations with technology companies and criticized several major firms for alleged bias against conservatives, has met repeatedly with major tech company CEOs since taking office, including meetings in 2019 with the chief executives of Facebook, Apple and Google.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - World War One movie ""1917"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" set in 1960s Tinseltown, won the top movie prizes at the Golden Globes on Sunday on a night packed with upsets and hot-button issues at the start of Hollywood s awards season.
""1917"" was named best drama and took best director, beating presumed front-runners ""The Irishman"" and ""Marriage Story,"" both from Netflix Inc . The nostalgic ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" from Sony Pictures won for best comedy/ musical, and had the biggest Golden Globe haul, with three awards.
Martin Scorsese s high-profile and costly gangster epic for Netflix went home empty-handed on a disappointing night for the streaming service that could affect its Oscar chances in February.
Netflix took home just one Golden Globe in the movie race, for Laura Dern s supporting role as a ruthless divorce lawyer in ""Marriage Story."" 
Apple  Inc s new Apple TV+ streaming service, in its first award show, failed to make good on any of its three nominations for ""The Morning Show.""
British director Sam Mendes was named best director for his immersive ""1917"" from Universal Pictures, a dark horse with no big names that arrived in U.S. movie theaters only 10 days ago.
""That is a big surprise,"" said a stunned Mendes. ""I really hope this means people will turn up and see it.""
Joaquin Phoenix, who played a terrifying ""Joker,"" and Renee Zellweger, who portrayed Judy Garland in ""Judy,"" took the drama movie actor honors. Taron Egerton (""Rocketman"") and Awkwafina (""The Farewell"") were first-time winners in the comedy/musical field.
""We all know there is no ... competition between us,"" Phoenix told his fellow nominees, praising their ""beautiful, mesmerizing work."" 
Tarantino won for the screenplay of his love letter to the industry, ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" while Brad Pitt was a popular winner for playing a laid-back stunt double in the film.
""I wanted to bring my mom,"" quipped Pitt. ""But any women I stand next to, they say I am dating."" 
GERVAIS GETS WICKED
British comedian and actor Ricky Gervais, hosting the awards ceremony for a fifth time, threw caution to the wind with expletives and jabs about the dominance of streaming platforms, diversity and Hollywood s sexual misconduct scandal, which drew mostly nervous laughter in the room of A-list celebrities.
Gervais noted that the room was packed with entertainment executives. ""They are all terrified of Ronan Farrow. He s coming for you,"" he said, referring to the American journalist whose reports helped uncover the sexual misconduct scandal that has swept Hollywood over the past two years.
Gervais was not the only celebrity at the boozy dinner to get political.
Michelle Williams , winning limited TV series actress for ""Fosse/Verdon,"" gave an impassioned speech about reproductive rights and encouraged women to vote.
She said she had built a career of her choosing and ""wouldn t have been able to do this without employing a woman s right to choose. To choose when to have my children and with whom.""
Others, including absent winner Russell Crowe, for television series ""The Loudest Voice,"" spoke of the devastating bushfires in Australia and the dangers of global warming.
Patricia Arquette, winning for limited TV series ""The Act,"" expressed fears over heightened tension in the Middle East following the U.S. killing of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani.
In the television races, HBO s media dynasty show ""Succession"" and Amazon  Studio s quirky British comedy ""Fleabag"" were the big winners.

British talent took multiple prizes. In addition to Mendes, they included ""Succession"" and ""Fleabag"" stars Brian Cox and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Olivia Colman for ""The Crown,"" ""Rocketman"" actor Taron Egerton, and music duo Elton John and Bernie Taupin for original song ""(I m Gonna) Love Me Again.""

Roku in November said it had 32.3 million active accounts.
Streaming devices such as Apple  TV, Chromecast and Fire TV that bundle together content from different streaming platforms have gained popularity as more people shift away from cable TV.

The S&P 500 will climb above 3,500 at some point this year, Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone  Group Inc.’s private wealth solutions business, wrote in a statement along with Chief Investment Strategist Joe Zidle. Economic growth will trail forecasts and the central bank will lower its benchmark rate to 1%, they predict. The equity gauge recently traded at 3,234 and Fed’s fund rate stood at 1.75% while economists tracked by Bloomberg expect U.S. gross domestic product to expand 1.8% this year.
“The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided,” they wrote. “S&P 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly.”
Wien, 86, a former  Morgan Stanley   strategist who’s put out his “surprises” list since 1986, is one of the most widely followed on Wall Street. A year ago, he predicted the S&P 500 would climb 15%, with the economy continuing to expand and the Federal Reserve refraining from raising interest rates. The benchmark index rallied 29% and the central bank cut rates three times.
Some of his forecasts for last year proved prescient, including a rally in Chinese shares and a flat U.S. dollar. His optimism for a U.S.-China trade deal to be reached in the first quarter, however, turned out to be misplaced. He also misjudged the chances for the U.K. to stay in the European Union and Theresa May to remain as prime minister.
For the coming year, Wien and Zidle predict that the U.S. and China will not reach a comprehensive phase two trade deal. To spur growth, President Donald Trump will cut payroll taxes, they say. While U.S. growth slows, foreign demand for Treasuries is expected to stay elevated as negative interest rates persist overseas. As a result, yields on 10-year Treasuries approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steeps, they forecast.
Wien says his surprise list is made up of events that investors assign 1-in-3 odds of happening but that he thinks are more than 50 percent likely. Below are the duo’s other calls for 2020:"

The remarks come as the fast-growing smartphone brand, which saw fast adoption in India in 2019, steadily turns its focus towards its home market in China, as device makers hope that consumers buy new phones this year compatible with the country s expanding 5G infrastructure.
Realme s X50 5G device is priced at roughly 2499 yuan ($359.71) for the cheapest variant, marking a lower cost mid-range entry in the recent spate of 5G devices released by Chinese brands.
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Oppo have each released four 5G models to date. Xiaomi Corp has launched three models, and CEO Lei Jun said last year the company would aim to unveil at least 10 models in 2020.
Apple Inc , which has seen sales in China struggle since their peak in 2015, is expected to release a 5G device later this year.
The 5G smartphone wave comes as China rapidly upgrades its telecommunication infrastructure to include 5G base stations. As of late November, China had 113,000 base stations in service, according to state media reports.
This has given Chinese smartphone brands an incentive to boost sales domestically. Overall Chinese phone sales dropped 4.5% annually in October 2019, according to government data.
Chase Qi, president of global marketing at Realme, said that he expects many consumers will upgrade their phones as 5G networks improve. 
He also said the company will focus on selling in Europe and the Middle East this year.
Realme originated as a sub-brand under Oppo, one of China s top smartphone brands, before spinning off as an independent division. Both companies, along with Vivo, and Oppo, are owned by BBK Electronics Corporation, a decades-old device maker.
The brand grew shipments in India nearly four-fold between Q3 2018 and Q3 2019, according to data from research firm IDC. 
Will Wong, who tracks China s smartphone sector of IDC, attributes the Realme s success in India to its affiliation with Oppo, which is known to give retail partners higher margins on device sales than competitors.
He adds that while China is a new market for the brand, it will steadily become a priority as 70% of the market is still low-end to mid-range.

The suspension of domestic LCD TV production comes after the company last year chopped its spending, replaced its long-time CEO and started a voluntary redundancy program.
""We will be wrapping up our LCD TV production in South Korea by end of this year and focusing on our LCD TV production in China,"" CEO Jeong Ho-young said at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas.
In October, the South Korean Apple  supplier said it planned to ""downsize"" two of its LCD TV panel production lines in South Korea and was looking into various options.
LCD TV businesses accounted for 32% of LG s revenue in the July to September period, down from 41% the previous quarter due to fewer shipments from its LCD TV panel plants.
LG Display operates two LCD TV production sites, one in South Korea and another in China.
The company suffered three consecutive quarterly losses between January and October last year, but Jeong said the panel maker is expecting to see ""further improvement"" in its performance in the second half of this year.
While terminating domestic LCD TV production, LG Display aims to shift its focus to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology. It expects the newer technology to account for 50% of revenue by 2021, up from about 30% in 2018.
""We plan to build systems to mass-produce OLED products in our Chinese factory by end of the first quarter this year,"" Jeong said.
He said the company was not planning to shift the LCD TV production lines marked for closure in South Korea into OLED panel production.
LG s cross-town rival Samsung Display, a unit of  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), said in October it had suspended one of its LCD production lines in South Korea.
It also announced a 13.1 trillion won ($11.25 billion) investment in facilities and research to upgrade a production line."

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - U.S. presidential adviser Ivanka Trump on Tuesday touted government-industry collaboration to create jobs, drawing applause at a tech show that contrasted with the criticism she faced beforehand for her lack of tech experience.
The daughter of Republican President Donald Trump and a businesswoman, Trump spoke at the annual CES tech conference in Las Vegas in the face of backlash from some industry officials, including women, who challenged her tech qualifications.
She said a White House council that she co-leads will launch a nationwide year-long advertising campaign to encourage all pathways to jobs, including apprenticeships, and not just a college degree.
""We need to raise awareness about many options that exist,"" she told the audience. Trump said the White House will release a national workforce strategy in the coming months. She said over 400 companies have committed to offering over 14 million training opportunities.
The council includes the chief executives from Apple Inc , Walmart  Inc,  IBM   Corp and other major companies.
Conference organizers defended Trump s participation, saying she leads White House efforts on job creation and economic growth through workforce development, skills training and entrepreneurship.
Consumer Technology Association CEO Gary Shapiro, who moderated the discussion with Trump, praised her remarks. ""On behalf of the industry, we want to work with you. We want to create jobs,"" Shapiro said.
Trump talked about efforts to boost paid family leave, finding people to fill 500,000 manufacturing job openings and doing more to recruit and retain immigrants that she dubbed ""the greatest talent in the world.""
""If we can t agree come together on this, we can t come together on anything,"" Trump told Shapiro.
Some in the Women Who Tech group on Facebook  voiced displeasure with the invitation to Trump.
Investor Elisabeth Fullerton wrote: ""This is an insult to women in technology. We did hard times in university, engineering, math, and applied sciences. This is what extreme privilege and entitlement get you. It s not what you know it s who you know I guess."""

With demand for smart phones and other hardware peaking, Apple has been striving to boost sales from purchases of apps and subscription services like its newly launched Apple TV+ streaming service or Apple Care maintenance packages.
The company said https://apple.co/37WG48P1.42 that between Dec. 24, 2019, and Jan. 1, 2020, its customers spent $1.42 billion in the App Store, a 16% increase over the previous year, and $386 million on Jan. 1 alone, a 20% increase.
The number of users of the News app rose nearly 18% from a year ago, although the company did not break out subscriber numbers for the Apple News+ service, which costs $9.99 per month.
The numbers also point to a big shift in spending in the Thanksgiving to Christmas holiday season in the United States, with consumers splurging on apps and online shopping rather than in brick-and-mortar stores.
Mastercard Inc s  data tracking retail sales from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve showed U.S. shoppers spent almost a fifth more online during this year s holiday shopping season than a year ago, accounting for 15% of all retail sales.
The App Store growth numbers were roughly in line with the overall trend for Apple s services segment revenue, which rose 16% to $46.3 billion in its most recent fiscal year ended in September. In comparison, iPhone sales fell 14% to $142.4 billion in the same period.
Apple keeps between 15% and 30% of the sales through its App Store, depending on whether users buy software as a one-time purchase or recurring subscription.
The company launched several new services in 2019, including the streaming service, a video game service and a credit card.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq notched a record close Wednesday after President Donald Trump s remarks stoked hopes of an end to rising U.S.-Iran tensions, easing fears of direct military conflict in the Middle East.  

The S&P 500 gained 0.48%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.67% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.56%.

A sigh of relief swept through the broader market as Trump opted to impose new economic sanctions on Iran rather than call for military action against the Islamic Republic.

""Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned,"" Trump said in a speech following Iran s strikes on several U.S. military bases.
""The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it,"" the president added.
Rising hopes that both nations will seek to de-escalate tensions reduced expectations of oil supply disruption in the Middle East, sending oil prices plunging 5% and keeping energy stocks in red.
Ahead of the speech, oil prices were on the back foot following an unexpected build in weekly crude supplies.
But the plunge in energy was more than offset by a rally in tech, underpinned by gains in Microsoft  and Apple  amid bullish remarks from Wall Street.
Morgan Stanley raised its target on Microsoft  to $189 from $157, on expectations that the tech giant is set to deliver strong performance in the coming year.
Wedbush, meanwhile, said robust iPhone 11 sales during the holiday season and strong AirPods performance should lead to ""clear upside"" in Apple s upcoming quarterly earnings report.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China s internet firms have fallen behind global peers in sourcing energy from clean, renewable sources, with soaring use of internet data driving up energy demand and carbon emissions, environmental group Greenpeace said in a report on Thursday.
As capacity rises rapidly, the internet data sector could account for a third of total global power demand within two decades, putting tech giants in China and elsewhere under heavy pressure to find cleaner sources of electricity.
But while some of China s tech firms are procuring clean energy through rooftop solar installations or via a pilot green power certificate scheme, most have failed to match the commitments made by overseas rivals, Greenpeace said.
""Power consumption from China s internet industry is skyrocketing, and it s imperative that Chinese internet giants lead the sector to break away from its reliance on coal,"" said Ye Ruiqi, a Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner.
In an evaluation of 15 major firms, Greenpeace said only one - the digital service provider Chindata - had pledged to deliver 100% of its energy needs via renewable sources, matching long-term commitments made by global giants like Apple  and Google .
Among companies heavily reliant on cloud computing, e-commerce giant  Alibaba   was ranked the best performer in Greenpeace s survey, which also looked at ""government and industry influence"" and data transparency, as well as emissions levels. Tencent (HK:0700) was second, followed by Baidu   and Huawei.
Tencent was the only major firm to disclose energy consumption and carbon emission levels but it has ""made almost no progress"" on renewable energy procurement, Greenpeace said, while Huawei was the only firm to set emission reduction targets.
Huawei already has its own solar plants at some facilities and has pledged to minimize power demand throughout its supply chain, a company spokesman said, adding that it was now working on new long-term emissions targets.
An Alibaba Cloud spokesman said the company was ""committed to making energy efficiency a core part of our technology"", with the firm already using solar panels as well as smart heating and cooling systems at some data centers.
Tencent and Baidu declined to comment on the survey.
China s internet data sector produced 99 million tonnes of CO2 in 2018 and consumed 161 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power, 2.35% of the national total, a previous Greenpeace study showed, adding that 73% of electricity used by the sector was supplied using coal.
Power consumption from the sector was expected to reach 267 TWh by 2023, more than Australia s total electricity demand, it added."

WHY IS TAIWAN IMPORTANT?
Aside from its key role in the global supply chain as a high-tech manufacturer, mostly notably as an Apple Inc  supplier, Taiwan is in a strategic location just off the coast of China and on the edge of the Pacific.
It is a potential military flashpoint between China and the United States, which sells arms and provides other assistance to Taiwan.
The self-ruled island lies on major shipping lanes between Southeast Asia and U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, and on the disputed South China Sea, where China has built artificial islands and air bases.
Taiwan is also close to a major U.S. military base on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.
WHO ARE THE CANDIDATES AND WHAT ARE THEIR POSITIONS?
President Tsai Ing-wen is seeking a second term in office. Her Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) favors the island s formal independence. Tsai has said repeatedly in the campaign that Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Tsai says it is up to Taiwan, not China, to decide the island s future, and has warned of the Chinese threat to democracy and liberty.
Her main opponent is Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party, which ruled China until 1949 when forced to flee to Taiwan after losing a civil war with the Communists.
Han favors close ties with China as the only way to ensure Taiwan s security and prosperity, though says he will defend the island s freedoms and democracy.
WHAT DOES CHINA THINK OF THE ELECTION?
China says it is not seeking to interfere in the vote, which it considers merely a local election in one of its provinces. State media often refers to Tsai as ""provincial governor"" and regularly denounces her.
But China will be closely watching.
For Beijing, the best outcome would be a Han victory.
If Tsai wins, China will probably further ratchet up pressure on Taiwan, perhaps even by conducting military drills close to the island.
However, it could also realize it must resume talks, as any conflict would be hugely damaging for China as well as Taiwan.
The real danger would come if Taipei ever tries declare a formally independent Republic of Taiwan. China passed a law in 2005 that authorizes the use of force against Taiwan if China judges it to have seceded.
WHAT DOES THE UNITED STATES THINK OF THE ELECTION?Although Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
It has taken no position on who should win, but has expressed concern at Chinese efforts at intimidation and influence.
Taiwan enjoys strong bipartisan support in Washington, and the Trump administration has approved billions in new arms sales.
Geopolitically, Washington has watched with alarm as China has taken Taiwan s allies in Central America and the Pacific, traditionally strong areas of U.S. influence."

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.
As the EU grapples with the limits of its foreign policy clout, it’s shifting focus to where it can legitimately claim to be a world leader. Next week, the Commission will unveil an investment plan designed to mobilize at least 1 trillion euros over the next decade for an  unprecedented shift to a climate-neutral economy.  Here’s what you need to know about the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, based on a draft we got hold of. But is the pot big enough to fund such a monumental overhaul, not to mention convincing skeptics like Poland to jump on the bandwagon?
What’s Happening
Foreign Talks | EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels today will reiterate their support for the moribund  Iran nuclear deal and their  calls for de-escalation in the Middle East, while pledging further support to Libya. The EU wants to make its itself useful (and therefore relevant) as a mediator in the conflicts raging in its own backyard, with little to show for its efforts so far.
Pension Strife | The French government  plans to meet with unions again today as it seeks a way to balance the cost of its pension system. The meeting comes after unions kept up pressure on Emmanuel Macron to abandon his reforms with a fourth day of demonstrations across the country yesterday, even though the government said a compromise may be in sight.
Budget Vote | Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa’s 2020 budget is set to pass in an initial vote in parliament today  thanks to the planned abstentions of lawmakers from several parties. The spending plan is Costa’s first budget after winning a second term and the premier wants to post the country’s first surplus in four decades of democracy, helped by higher tax revenue.
Climate Push | Germany’s long and lengthening catalog of outstanding climate goals, among the top priorities on the government’s agenda this year, threatens to tarnish Chancellor Angela Merkel’s legacy if left unfulfilled.  Here’s the to-do list facing Germany’s so-called “Climate Chancellor” in 2020.
In Case You Missed It
Brexit Deal | Boris Johnson’s Brexit legislation cleared its final hurdle in the House of Commons, putting an end to the parliamentary gridlock that cost his predecessor Theresa May her job. With the U.K.’s split from the bloc this month now virtually a formality, attention is already turning toward negotiations on the future relationship.
Looking Up | German industrial production  rebounded in November, a cautious sign that Europe’s largest economy may be near the bottom of its manufacturing slump. The data, which follows numbers that showed factory orders tumbling, will be keenly studied by the ECB, which has  ramped up stimulus to combat a slowdown in the euro region.
Orban Plan | Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he’s ready to start a new  political platform in Europe if his Fidesz party is forced out of the European People’s Party. The continent’s biggest political group has played a key role in protecting Orban over the past decade, as he centralized power at home while drawing EU probes over the erosion of the rule of law.
Head Scratcher | Sweden’s Riksbank is facing criticism from economists for not doing enough to explain last month’s historic decision to end five years of negative interest rates. The confusion follows an increasingly tense debate around the merits of negative rates while the central bank has defended what it saw as the only way to fight years of disinflation.
New Hires | Europe’s top market watchdog is adding more than 100 extra staff as it plans a major expansion of oversight over the next couple of years. The Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority said its priorities will include bolstering EU capital markets and responding to Brexit, which will strip the regulator of its biggest financial hub.
Irish Prize | Apple CEO Tim Cook will  receive an award in Dublin on Jan. 20 in recognition of the iPhone maker’s 40 years of investment in Ireland — a decision that may raise some eyebrows. Although it’s one of the nation’s major employers, Apple  is still reeling from being hit with a record 13 billion-euro Irish tax bill in one of the biggest state aid cases on record.
Chart of the Day
More than 7% of the EU population said they couldn’t afford to heat their home sufficiently in 2018, according to an EU-wide survey — an improvement from a peak recorded six years previously. The results vary significantly across the region. One in three Bulgarians, in the bloc’s southeastern corner, suffer chilly abodes. That number was less than 2% in Finland — the EU’s northernmost member — and Austria.

(Reuters) - As newly liberated royals, Britain s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have the world at their feet with the potential to make money in areas ranging from fashion and speaking engagements to forming their own production company.
But the couple, formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, should move wisely to make themselves financially independent in a world where social media influencers like Kim Kardashian reign and where their visibility will be magnified rather than reduced, branding experts and Hollywood observers say.
""Brand Sussex is a global brand and could end up making an absolute fortune, from public speaking to Meghan reinventing her lifestyle blog, to merchandising or brand endorsements,"" said Nick Bullen, editor-in-chief of True Royalty TV.
Harry and Meghan shocked Queen Elizabeth when they announced on Wednesday they wanted to lead a more independent life, and finance it themselves.
Meghan s background as an actress on the U.S. television show ""Suits"" immediately prompted speculation she could return to acting.
But the range of options open to them is far wider. It could include establishing an independent production company to make television shows, documentaries, podcasts or movies along the lines of the Higher Ground company formed by ex-President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.
Harry already has teamed up with Oprah Winfrey to produce a forthcoming documentary focusing on mental health for Apple s new streaming service. Apple  declined to respond to queries about further collaborations with the prince.
""The Obamas are a great model for how to make money and keep it classy. They could find projects that are moving and sometimes Meghan could be in them. If it s a documentary, maybe Harry could narrate it,"" said veteran Hollywood public relations strategist Howard Bragman.
Bragman said the pair should be judicious about their choices because ""the level of scrutiny they are going to get is going to be ridiculous, and not always fair.""
The booming public speaking circuit in North America could prove to be a lucrative source of income.
""Big name speakers get well into six figures to make an appearance or give a speech at an event. If they choose to pursue that avenue, they would be considered in the top echelon of speakers,"" said Jeff Jacobson, co-founder of Canada-based Talent Bureau.
ECLIPSED ON INSTAGRAM
Meghan has considerable clout in the fashion world. Global fashion search platform Lyst in November named her the world s most powerful dresser of 2019 and last year she launched a clothing collection in Britain to benefit an organization that helps underprivileged women secure employment.
Britain s Sun newspaper reported on Friday that the duchess was discussing a project with French fashion house Givenchy, which made her wedding dress in 2018. Reuters could not confirm the report.
The ""half-royal"" duo will also face stiff competition from established celebrities and YouTubers, who can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars from a single endorsement on social media.
""Harry and Meghan have a combined Instagram following of 10 million, which is eclipsed by the likes of (soccer player) Cristiano Ronaldo with nearly 200 million,"" said Los Angeles branding expert Jeetendr Sehdev, author of ""The Kim Kardashian Principle.""
Building a social media following means being candid, fearless and transparent. ""That is a challenge for the royal family because they have always tried to be the most neutral people,"" he said.
""The Meghan and Harry brand is like a start-up. There is lots of potential but no proven value yet,"" Sehdev added.
Bragman however said that the mixed race couple ""are very representative of what brands are looking for today."""

(Reuters) - Wall Street hovered near all-time highs on Friday, as easing Middle East tensions and technology stocks offset concerns about slower-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in December.
U.S. stocks opened at record highs, brushing off government data that showed U.S. jobs increased by 145,000 last month, below the forecast for a 164,000 rise.
The pace of hiring remained more than enough to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track, while Friday s report also showed the jobless rate holding near a 50-year low of 3.5% and average hourly earnings rising 0.1% in the previous month.
""This report is almost in line with consensus except for the wage aspect. That was disappointing,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial  in Newark, New Jersey.
""This report is not enough to move the market one way or the other.""
The data also did little to change expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates where they are for most of this year. [MMT/]
Bank stocks  were down 0.7%, causing Wall Street to pare some gains in late morning trading.

Global equities resumed their record rally this week after the U.S. and Iran backed down on further military action, and hopes of an initial U.S.-China trade deal kept investors optimistic.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network that the trade deal is on track to be signed on Jan. 15.
Apple Inc  rose 0.5% after  Credit Suisse   became the latest brokerage to raise its price target on the stock, citing a better-than-feared iPhone 11 cycle so far.
Dragging the Dow lower,  Boeing Co   fell 1.5% after the company released hundreds of internal messages that contained harshly critical comments on 737 MAX development.
With the fourth-quarter earnings season set to begin in earnest next week, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to drop 0.6% in their second consecutive quarterly decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  launched a long-awaited app this week for customers of its online bank Marcus.
The lack of a mobile app had frustrated smartphone users who, until now, could only view account information, make loan payments or balance transfers on the bank s website.
""Exactly what I was waiting for,"" wrote one Marcus customer on the Apple  App store, where the mobile app was released on Monday.
The bank launched Marcus in 2016 to diversify its revenue and funding sources by offering savings accounts and personal loans to retail customers. Until then, Goldman Sachs had operated primarily as an investment bank and trading house since its founding in 1869, using mostly money from the wholesale market. 
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Kristen Greco said on Friday that one of the most common customer requests has been for the bank to launch an app, and software engineers and developers ""spent the better part of 2019"" creating one.
Software engineers and developers who worked on Clarity Money, a personal finance start-up Goldman bought in 2018, were tasked with developing the Marcus app. ""People expect a digital bank to have an app,"" Greco said. ""We wanted to make sure we did it right."" Marcus, with $55 billion in U.S. and UK customer deposits and $5 billion in loans, has allowed the bank to build a pool of deposits to run day-to-day much more cheaply.
The bank reported on Monday that its consumer bank, which includes Marcus and its fledgling credit card business, contributes less than 3% of its overall revenues.

The Cupertino, California-based company says the robot is part of its plan to become a ""closed-loop"" manufacturer that does not rely on the mining industry, an aggressive goal that some industry analysts have said is impossible.
Many mining executives note that with the rising popularity of electric vehicles, newly mined minerals will be needed on an even larger scale, a reality that Apple acknowledges.
""We re not necessarily competing with the folks who mine,"" said Lisa Jackson, the company s head of environment, policy and social. ""There s nothing for miners to fear in this development."" 
Inside a nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of Austin, Texas, Apple s Daisy robot breaks apart iPhones so that 14 minerals, including lithium, can be extracted and recycled. 
Apple is already using recycled tin, cobalt and rare earths in some of its products, with plans to add to that list. The company last month bought the first commercial batch of carbon-free aluminum from a joint venture between Rio Tinto  and  Alcoa  .
Daisy, less than 20 yards in length, uses a four-step process to remove an iPhone battery with a blast of -80 Celsius (-176 Fahrenheit) degree air, and then pop out screws and modules, including the haptic module that makes a phone vibrate. 
The components are then sent off to recyclers for the minerals to be extracted and refined. Daisy can tear apart 200 iPhones per hour. Apple chose the iPhone to be the first of its products that Daisy would disassemble because of its mass popularity, said Jackson.
Apple is considering sharing the Daisy technology with others, including electric automakers. Daisy does have its skeptics, including some in the tech world who want the company to focus more on building products that can be repaired, not just recycled.
""There s this ego that believes they can get all their minerals back, and it s not possible,"" said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a firm advocating for electronics repair, rather than replacement.
That may partially explain why the mining industry isn t worried. 
""Apple is in an enviable position, because they can do this,"" said Tom Butler, president of the International Council on Mining and Metals, an industry trade group. ""Not everyone else will be able to follow suit."""

Investing.com – Apple  continued its ride higher into record territory Monday after DA Davidson hiked its price target on the tech giant amid expectations it will roll out 5G iPhones later this year.

DA Davidson raised its price target on Apple  to $375 from $300, forecasting a near-20% rise from current prices. Apple rose about 0.9% after hitting  an intraday record high of $313.38. 

With the iPhone maker expected to release 5G featured phones later this fall, DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said: ""there is enough complexity and hype when it comes to 5G that we believe Apple can exploit this multi-year opportunity.""

This year’s iPhones are expected to come in new sizes, one with a 5.4-inch display, two with a 6.1-inch displays and one with a much larger 6.7-inch screen. 
Apple s run to all-time highs has been supported by a slew of recent upgrades from Wall Street.

Just last month, Bank of America  raised its price target on Apple, estimating that 5G iPhones will drive consistent 200 million iPhone sales during 2020 to 2022. The bank also highlighted the continuing strong demand for the existing iPhones that were unveiled in September last year.
The upcoming launch of Apple s 5G iPhone has been touted as an important upgrade cycle as the tech giant s most recent slate of smartphones has not generated the fanfare and record sales that were once commonplace.
Some on Wall Street have suggested investors temper their expectations for the pace of 5G adoption.
""Ultimately, this is a massive opportunity for Apple , huge play on 5G, but it’s going to take a while for networks to roll out coverage,"" Gene Munster, co-founder of research-driven venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said in December.
Those claims were backed up somewhat by TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said that countries with little to no 5G coverage will receive phones with 5G disabled to save on manufacturing costs.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday, as sentiment on U.S.-China trade received a boost on reports that the White House will no longer label China a currency manipulator. That comes just days ahead of the expected conclusion of the phase one trade deal.

The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.04% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.28%, 

The White House plans to remove its designation of China as a currency manipulator, according to published reports.

The U.S. government last summer tagged China with the label of currency manipulator when tensions between Washington and Beijing threatened to boil over.

The news helped raised optimism ahead of the U.S. and China signing the first phase of their trade deal on Wednesday.

The phase one trade deal would halt any escalations in tit-for-tat tariffs and roll back some existing U.S. tariffs in Chinese goods.
The positive sentiment on trade coupled with bullish calls from Wall Street on tech heavyweights like Apple  and Microsoft  helped tech stocks continued their march higher.

Apple closed at record highs after DA Davidson hiked its price target on the tech giant amid expectations it will roll out 5G iPhones later this year.
Microsoft  ended the day more than 1% higher after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the tech giant to $180 from $155.

Tesla  surged 9%, topping $500 for the first time, underpinned by a target price hike from Oppenheimer to $612 from $358
Industrials, meanwhile, also played a part in the broader market rally, led by gains in   General Electric    on bullish remarks from Deutsche Bank

""We see the potential for GE to deliver a beat in 4Q19 and 2020 guidance that suggests upside to current consensus at the midpoint of the range,""   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) said.

Healthcare, however, proved an exception to broader rally as news that presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had taken the lead in Iowa raised concerns about the private healthcare insurance market.

Sanders has backed proposals for a universal Medicare plan, where people could be guaranteed coverage without using private insurance.  
Cigna  and UnitedHealth Group  slipped about 3%, while   Centene    fell about 2%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will meet on Feb. 25 to determine the probable cause of the 2018 fatal crash of a Tesla Inc  vehicle in Mountain View, California, the agency said.
The board will hold a hearing on the 2017 Tesla Model X crash that killed the its driver, 38-year-old Apple  engineer Walter Huang, who was using the vehicle s advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot.
The NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are investigating a number of crashes in which Autopilot is believed to have been in use.
The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system s ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects. There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot compel action, while NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a vehicle poses an unreasonable safety risk.
Last week, NHTSA said it was launching an investigation into the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla  Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana. 
That crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects Autopilot or another advanced driver assistance system was in use. It is the third Tesla crash NHTSA has said it was investigating in recent weeks.
Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, including the 2018 Mountain View crash. Tesla did not immediately comment.
NHTSA is also probing another Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited a freeway, ran a red light, and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
The NTSB has criticized Autopilot s lack of safeguards. It said in September that its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California, Tesla crash found the system s design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.""
Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc s  Google within two years plans to block a common way businesses track online surfers in its Chrome browser, endorsing costly changes to how the Web operates as it tries to satisfy increased privacy demands from users.
Google s plan is to restrict advertising software companies and other organizations from connecting their browser cookies to websites they do not operate, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. 
Apple  made a similar move in 2017 in its Safari browser, but Chrome s global market share is more than three times greater at about 64%, according to tracking company Statcounter.
Though the two-year goal is new, Google s announcement had been expected within the industry for months. Financial analysts expect minimal effect on Google s own ad business because it gathers data on users in many other ways. 
But shares of some rival advertising software companies fell on Tuesday, including Criteo SA  by 8% and  Trade Desk Inc   by 1.4%.
For nearly three decades, cookies placed by relatively unknown companies on nearly every website have fueled advertising on the internet. 
Cookies are a tool within browsers that allow website operators to save data about users, so that for example, they can keep a particular user logged into a website over multiple days. 
But cookies also have given obscure software vendors, whose technology is used by website operators, a broad window into which webpages a user is visiting. When shared with advertisers, the data enable predictions about which ads the individual would find relevant.
Users and regulators have questioned how businesses with access to the browsing data store and share them since the advent of the cookie. But over the last three years, data breaches and new privacy laws in California and Europe have prompted major changes at internet businesses.
Google said its new restriction would not go into effect until alternatives that Google considers more privacy-preserving are viable. Any major transition in Web technology requires significant investment by website operators, and it remains unclear whether more limited data on users would depress online ad prices.

Justin Schuh, a director for Chrome engineering at Google, said initial feedback to proposals it announced in August ""gives us confidence that solutions in this space can work."""

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The S&P 500 eased from record highs on Tuesday as sentiment on trade was knocked by a report the U.S. will keep tariffs on Chinese goods through the 2020 U.S. election in November.

The S&P 500 lost 0.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.24% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.11%.

Existing tariffs on imported Chinese goods are likely to remain in place until after the U.S. election, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter said.

Washington will review Beijing s compliance with the trade agreement no sooner than 10 months after the signing of the phase one agreement on Wednesday, according to the report.

The decision to keep the tariffs in place would allow the White House to reimpose levies if it determines that Beijing has not lived up to its end of the agreement.
Sentiment on trade soured somewhat forcing stocks to give up their earnings-infused gains following mostly bullish reports from major Wall Street banks.
JPMorgan  and   Citigroup    ended the day 1% higher as both banks beat earnings estimates from Investing.com thanks to a rebound in fourth-quarter trading activity.
  Wells Fargo   , however, slipped 5% after its earnings fell short of estimates.

Delta Air Lines  surged 3% after delivering blowout earnings, underpinned by lower fuel prices and higher demand for travel.

Boeing  rose 0.6% despite posting the lowest orders in 30 years as the grounding of its 737 Max continued to weigh on performance.
Following a recent streak of gains, tech ended the day in the red, led by weakness in Apple .

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump lashed out at Apple Inc  on Tuesday, castigating the iPhone maker for what he said was its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals while benefiting from government help on trade.
Trump s tweet came amid the investigation into the fatal shooting of three Americans by a Saudi Air Force officer at the U.S. Naval Station in Pensacola, Florida, last month, which Attorney General William Barr called “an act of terrorism” on Monday.
The episode marks the latest flare-up in a privacy debate between technology companies such as Apple and  Facebook Inc   and authorities. 
The tech companies argue that strong encryption protects the privacy and security of their users, while law enforcement officials say criminals have used the technology to evade justice and called on tech firms to provide a way to crack it, using high-profile cases such as Pensacola and the 2015 mass shooting by Islamic militants in San Bernardino, California, as examples.
Trump on Tuesday had harsh words for Apple.
""We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements,"" the U.S. president said on Twitter. ""They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW!"" he said.
Apple has said it cannot access data that is encrypted with a passcode and stored on an iPhone and that it would have to build a specific tool for doing so, known in the tech industry as a ""backdoor."" The company can and does, however, hand over data stored on its cloud storage servers to law enforcement officials, which often includes backups of iPhones, including iMessages.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment on Trump s tweet. On Monday, the company said it rejected “the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance."" 
Earlier on Monday Barr called on Apple to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock two iPhones involved in the Pensacola case.
Apple said it had responded to seven separate legal requests from federal investigators in December, starting the day of the shooting.
The company said it turned over ""many gigabytes"" of data to investigators, including iCloud backups, account information and transactional data for multiple accounts. Apple said the FBI did not request help unlocking phones until Jan. 6, with a request for a second iPhone sent on Jan. 8.
“A federal judge has authorized the Department of Justice to access the contents of the dead terrorist’s phones. Apple designed these phones and implemented their encryption. It’s a simple,  front-door  request: Will Apple help us get into the shooter’s phones or not?” Kerri Kupec, a Department of Justice spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday.
In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union called Trump s demand ""dangerous and unconstitutional"" and said it would weaken the security of millions of iPhones.
""There is simply no way for Apple, or any other company, to provide the FBI access to encrypted communications without also providing it to authoritarian foreign governments and weakening our defenses against criminals and hackers,"" the ACLU said.
After the shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, federal investigators eventually turned to third-party cybersecurity firms for help to unlock the shooter s device.

The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that the devices used by the Pensacola shooter were older iPhone 5 and iPhone 7 models and cited cybersecurity experts as saying commercial firms could likely crack them."

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump lashed out at Apple in a tweet for refusing to unlock phones in criminal investigations while the company benefited from the federal government s help on trade issues. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking to unlock two iPhones involved in the case regarding the shooting of three Americans by a Saudi Air Force officer at the U.S. Naval Station in Pensacola, Florida. Attorney General William Barr this week called on Apple to help. 
Their request has renewed attention to privacy issues in the digital age, with Apple and its rivals arguing strong encryption protects users while law enforcement officials counter it allows criminals to evade justice.
""I understand the president s view, and it is absolutely critical for our technology companies to cooperate with law enforcement,"" Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview.
Mnuchin later told reporters at the White House that he had not discussed the issue with Apple and did not know the specifics at hand. ""I know Apple has cooperated in the past on law enforcement issues, and I expect they would continue ... to cooperate.""

Apple has said that it has helped investigators in the Pensacola case by providing other data, but that it cannot access encrypted data stored on the actual devices without building a so-called ""back door."""

(Reuters) - A television series developed for Apple Inc  by famed director M. Night Shyamalan blatantly copied a 2013 film, a copyright lawsuit filed on Wednesday claimed.
Italian-American director Francesca Gregorini sued Apple and Shyamalan in Los Angeles federal court, alleging the recently released horror series ""Servant"" plagiarized her 2013 film ""The Truth About Emanuel.""
Apple declined to comment and a publicist for Shyamalan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Having a very personal labor of love stolen, which is what this case is about, is soul-crushing,"" Gregorini said in a press release.
Gregorini s lawyer, David Erikson, said in a statement that the similarities between the two works ""are so pervasive, and so grounded in my client’s highly creative and uniquely personal artistic choices, that the idea they might have resulted from coincidence is preposterous.""
Shyamalan, known for his film-ending twists, has directed films including ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""
Tony Basgallop, the writer and creator of ""Servant,"" was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
""Servant"" and ""The Truth About Emanuel"" both tell the story of a mother who, grieving the death of her baby, forms an attachment to a realistic doll who she believes to be alive. In both works, a teenage nanny goes along with the grieving mother and cares for the doll as if it were alive.
Gregorini s lawsuit alleged that there are also striking similarities between scenes, themes, and settings in the two works.
Apple TV+, the iPhone maker’s entry into the crowded streaming TV market, debuted on Nov. 1 with four TV series for adults, an episode of “Oprah’s Book Club,” a nature documentary, and three children’s series. Additional programming is being added.

All of the programming is original because, unlike Netflix Inc  and Disney+ from Walt  Disney   Co, Apple does not have rights to a back catalog of TV shows and movies."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) forecast an up to 45% spike in January-March revenue and raised its capex plan for the year, betting robust demand for 5G smartphones would dial up profits at the world s top contract chipmaker.
The promising outlook from TSMC - a proxy for global tech demand given it has clients like Apple , Qualcomm  and Huawei [HWT.UL] - comes as a strong uptake of 5G smartphones is fuelling an overall recovery in the global smartphone market that has shrunk for the past three years.
TSMC said it expects revenue over January-March to reach $10.2 billion-$10.3 billion, versus $7.1 billion a year ago.
""Moving into first quarter 2020, despite mobile product seasonality, we anticipate our business to be supported by the continued ramp up of 5G smartphones,"" Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said at a briefing on Thursday, after TSMC earlier reported a better-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter.
However, the outlook assumes no disruption caused by the China-U.S. trade war. The world s two largest economies signed an initial trade deal on Wednesday, but with numerous thorny issues still unresolved.
The United States has in particular pressured Huawei, believing it a potential security threat, despite the Chinese company s repeated denials.
""The company sees any disruption will be short-lived and for example commented that smaller telco infrastructure suppliers can quickly pick up the shortfall if Huawei can t deploy 5G as planned,"" analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note.
""We find that too optimistic and believe the short-term impact will be notable.""
TSMC s October-December net profit rose 16.1% year-on-year to T$116.035 billion ($3.88 billion), above an average forecast of T$111.41 billion drawn from 19 analysts by Refinitiv.
Revenue rose 10.6% to $10.39 billion, versus the company s estimate of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion and an average $10.55 billion estimate from 21 analysts.
""Our fourth-quarter business benefited from strong demand for high-end smartphones, initial 5G deployment and high performance computing related applications using TSMC s industry-leading 7-nanometer technology,"" Huang said.
The 7-nanometer is one of the most advanced technology TSMC uses for its high-end semiconductors.
TSMC expects the global market for foundry chipmaking - contract chip manufacturing - to grow 17% this year, outstripping an 8% rise in the semiconductor market worldwide.
It raised its estimate for capital expenditure to $15-16 billion for 2020, versus an earlier forecast of a level similar to its estimated capex for 2019, which was $14-15 billion. In the end it spent $14.9 billion in 2019.
RISING SMARTPHONE DEMAND
The higher capex allocation comes amid forecasts for rising smartphone demand. Industry tracker IDC sees global smartphone shipments topping 1.4 billion units in 2020, up 1.5% on year, which should bode well for chipmaker TSMC.
Reflecting growing optimism for the tech sector, TSMC shares hit a record high this month after gaining more than 50% in 2019.
Investor sentiment should get a further boost from a Phase 1 trade deal agreed this week between the United States and China that is expected to defuse their 18-month trade war, which has weighed on the global economy and the tech industry.
""Looking into 2020-21, we believe TSMC s position in advanced technology nodes remains solid given its greater capacity, yield rate control, execution and diversified customer base,"" KGI analyst Laura Chen wrote in a January report prior to the earnings announcement.
Japan s Nikkei reported this week that the United States had increased pressure on TSMC to make military-use chips there, free from any potential Chinese interference. China claims Taiwan as its own territory.
TSMC declined to comment on the report, reiterating that the company is always evaluating the idea of making chips everywhere.
Company chairman Mark Liu said a decision will be made based on the ""best interest"" of their clients.
""We listen to our customers as our priority,"" he said. ""In the future, right now, it s too early to say. Our customers prefer us to have the lowest (cost) production site in doing business with us.""
To overcome geopolitical changes, TSMC will continue to be the industry s leader so that ""people will have to come to you"", he added. ""That s how we maintain being everyone s foundry."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate reporting season is expected to show lackluster profit growth, and it has already gotten off to a bumpy start, with big banks kicking off the fourth quarter to mixed investor reaction so far on the stock market.
With the vast majority of the S&P 500 still yet to report, forecasters expect fourth-quarter earnings to be down 0.5% from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Q4 is probably the last quarter where the market kind of gives a pass to earnings,"" said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston.
Among the large banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co  and  Citigroup   reported results that beat expectations, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  and  Wells Fargo   & Co missed.
Within the S&P 500, estimates vary widely for sector performance in the fourth quarter. Financials and utilities companies overall are expected to have tallied double-digit profit growth, while energy, industrials and consumer discretionary are seen reporting declines.
(GRAPHIC: Q4 earnings expectations, by sector: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001QXW9BER/eikon.png)
Many investors say they are more focused on corporate outlooks, with stronger 2020 profit growth needed to help justify big gains in the stock market. As of Wednesday, consensus analyst estimates called for a nearly 10% rise in earnings this year, according to Refinitiv.
""There is a lot more optimism priced into the 2020 numbers than there has been priced into the 2019 numbers,"" Lafferty said.
(GRAPHIC: 2020 earnings estimates, by sector: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001QXWBBEV/eikon.png)
With 2019 being a relatively sluggish year for profits, the stock market s ascent reflected a rising valuation on equities.
The S&P 500 s forward price-to-earnings ratio has climbed from roughly 14 times to start 2019 to about 18 times by the end, an increase that investors attributed largely to interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
Investors say such extensive P/E expansion is unlikely again this year, putting pressure on corporate earnings to come through.
“We expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,” LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch said in written commentary on Wednesday. “With valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.”
(GRAPHIC: US stock market valuation: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1075/1066/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Particular focus will be on results from market heavyweights Apple Inc ,  Microsoft Corp  , Alphabet  Inc and Amazon.com Inc , which alone represent about 15% weighting in the benchmark S&P 500.
Those stocks, particularly Apple and Microsoft, contributed a significant chunk of the S&P 500 s 31.5% total return last year, according to Goldman Sachs data.

“Hon Hai will be responsible for design, components and supply chain management,” Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News in a text message, adding that the company will not get into car assembly. The manufacturer expects the automotive business to account for 10% of overall sales in the long run, according to Liu, and the new venture will have little impact on Hon Hai’s earnings this year.
Hon Hai and Fiat Chrysler are focusing on the China market because of sheer volume, Liu said. While consumers in the country buy more electric vehicles than anywhere else in the world, sales have slumped since the government pared back subsidies amid a broader-market downturn in demand."

Below is a snapshot of the promises and achievements U.S. West Coast tech companies have made in the area:
MICROSOFT CORP:
Microsoft said it would be carbon negative by 2030, and that by 2050 it hopes to have sequestrated enough carbon to account for all the direct emissions the company has ever made.
The Windows operating system maker said it would fund the program with an internal carbon fee, and that its new climate innovation fund would invest $1 billion over the next four years into new technologies to reduce its carbon footprint.
Microsoft expects to generate 16 million metric tons of CO2 in 2020, including indirect emissions from activities like corporate travel.
The company said on Jan. 16 it would release annual reports of its carbon emission starting this year and would also sign the United Nation s Business Ambition Pledge to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. [ nL1N29L11N] 
APPLE INC:
The iPhone maker last March said that it had reduced carbon emissions by 64% since 2011, preventing 2.8 million metric tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.
It also said it had doubled the number of suppliers using only clean energy for production and was on track to add 4 gigawatts of renewable energy to the power used by its supply chain by 2020.
However, in October Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said https://cnb.cx/2TsHjZ4 in a speech that the company was on track to add 6 gigawatts of renewable power with its suppliers by 2020, raising its previous goal.
In December, Apple  bought the first-ever commercial batch of carbon-free aluminum from a joint venture between aluminum suppliers  Alcoa   Corp and  Rio Tinto  , to be used in Apple products.
Apple s global facilities, including retail stores, offices and data centers across 43 countries use 100% renewable energy, it had said in 2018.
AMAZON.COM INC:
Amazon  Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has pledged to make the e-commerce giant net carbon neutral by 2040 and has said it will buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from U.S. start-up Rivian.
Cutting emissions is a challenging goal for Amazon, which delivers about 10 billion items a year and has a massive transportation and data center footprint.
In September, Bezos said that Amazon would use 100% clean energy by 2030, up from 40%. 
ALPHABET INC: 
Alphabet  Inc s Google has vowed to neutralize carbon emissions from delivering consumer hardware by 2020 and include recycled plastic in each of its products by 2022.
The search giant said in August its transport-related carbon emissions per unit fell 40% in 2018 compared to 2017 by relying more on ships instead of planes to move hardware from factories.
In September, the company said it reduced its greenhouse gas emission by 3.7 million tons to 750,000 tons of CO2 in 2018. The company says it has cut carbon emission by 52% since 2011.
Google bought enough renewable energy to match 100% of its global annual electricity use in 2017 and 2018, it said last year.
FACEBOOK INC:
 Facebook Inc   said last year it was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas footprint by 75% from 2017 levels next year and to using 100% renewable energy in 2020.

A report by the social network shows that it has reduced green house gas emissions by 23% to 339,000 metric tons in the four years since 2014."

By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The S&P closed at a record high Thursday as signs the consumer remains on solid footing and bullish earnings from   Morgan Stanley    prompted a wave of buying across stocks.

The S&P 500 rose 0.84%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.06% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 0.92%. All three major averages ended the day in record terriroty.

 Morgan Stanley   rallied 6.6% as the Wall Street bank raised its profit outlook following results that beat on both the top and bottom lines. The earnings beat following a similar showing from rivals like JPMorgan  and   Citigroup    earlier this week.
The day of green was also supported by easing worries over the health of U.S. consumer, which has been one of the main catalysts underpinning economic growth, following in-line retail sales.
A weaker-than-expected sales report from   Target    a day earlier had raised doubts on the strength of the U.S. consumer over the crucial holiday period.

Still, some on Wall Street said the weaker report from Target may signal headwinds for Walmart , which reports earnings next month.

""We don’t think WMT was immune to the headwinds TGT faced in the weaker product categories it called out, and it may also have been affected by the shorter holiday period,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Tech, meanwhile, remained red-hot thanks to gains in tech heavyweights like Facebook , Apple  and Alphabet .

NEW YORK (Reuters) - NBCUniversal s new Peacock streaming service will offer free and $5-per-month options with advertising to try to win customers for its belated entry into the online video wars, the company announced on Thursday.
NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp  is betting that viewers who have abandoned traditional pay TV and are weary of being asked to open their wallets for multiple streaming services will embrace a no-cost alternative with commercials. 
Peacock will debut for Comcast customers on April 15 and across the United States on July 15. The company plans to expand the service to other countries over time.
Executives unveiled their offering at a celebrity-studded presentation to investors inside Studio 8H in New York s 30 Rockefeller Plaza where long-running sketch comedy show ""Saturday Night Live"" is broadcast. 
Actor and writer Tina Fey, who is creating a comedy series for Peacock, appeared onstage to highlight the breadth of programming to be available, from next-day access to current NBC series to the entire catalog of shows such as ""Cheers,"" ""30 Rock,"" ""The Office"" and ""Saturday Night Live"", as well as classic movies from ""Jaws"" to ""Jurassic Park.""
""Tonight Show"" host Jimmy Fallon said his show and ""Late Night with Seth Meyers"" would be available to some customers of Peacock - which was named after NBC s longtime logo - more than three hours before they air on traditional television. ""Wait, what names did you turn down before settling on Peacock?"" Fallon quipped onstage.
NBCUniversal said it expects to reach 30 million to 35 million active Peacock accounts by 2024.
""We believe affordability will be critical as more subscription sources are launched, leading to bigger customer bills,"" said NBCUniversal Chairman Steve Burke. 
Peacock will be one of the last entries in the crowded streaming landscape, dominated by Netflix Inc  and including Walt  Disney   Co s Disney+, Apple  Inc s Apple TV+, Amazon.com  Inc s Amazon Prime Video, Hulu (controlled by Disney), and ViacomCBS Inc s CBS All Access. In May, AT&T  Inc s WarnerMedia will launch its new entrant, HBO Max.
The majority of those services make money from subscription revenue, but Comcast opted to sell ads to run with the programming and offer a service at no charge to consumers. 
""It is impossible to overstate the power of free,"" said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of NBCUniversal advertising and partnerships. ""Zero dollars means zero barriers between advertisers and consumers.""
Peacock will include 10 advertising formats, such as so-called shoppable ads that let viewers purchase products, but will limit the amount to 5 minutes or less per hour, the ""lightest ad load in the entire industry,"" Yaccarino said. 
The average commercial time per hour topped 14 minutes on broadcast and cable networks last year, according to Nielsen.
 BINGE ADS 
State Farm,  Target  Corp  and  Unilever   PLC are among the early advertisers on the service, which will bring in ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in initial advertising revenue, NBCUniversal said in a statement. 
Peacock will also feature ""binge ads,"" where a viewer watches three episodes of a show and a sponsor can make the fourth episode ad-free. 
NBCUniversal hopes to lure advertisers through the vast amounts of data it can use to target commercials based on viewers  interests, including data from Comcast s cable TV set-top boxes.
Peacock Free will be offered nationwide and include more than 7,500 hours of programming including classic NBC series and news and sports including the Olympics. 
Peacock Premium, which will cost $5 per month and include ads, will feature more than 15,000 hours of content including Peacock originals and additional sports. It will be free for Comcast and Cox subscribers, who currently number more than 24 million, NBCUniversal said. Those customers can pay $5 a month to access the ad-free option.
Other viewers who want to avoid ads can pay $10 per month.
Competition ranges from $5-per-month Apple TV Plus and Disney s $7 per-month service. The standard Netflix plan costs $13 per month.

Comcast is investing $2 billion in Peacock throughout 2020 and 2021, and will break even by year five, according to Comcast Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh. Netflix, by contrast, earmarked $19 billion in cash for content in 2019. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Google-parent Alphabet  Inc became on Thursday the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion, some funds holding its shares are wondering whether now is the time to cash in on the stock s extraordinary gains.
Shares of the Internet search giant are up nearly 17% over the last three months, outpacing a broader rally in the S&P 500 index over the same period by 6 percentage points.
Short interest in the stock, a measure of how many investors are betting on a price decline, is at 1%, near a 52-week high for the company and higher than competitors such as Microsoft  and Facebook , according to Refinitv data.
Alphabet joins Apple , Amazon.com  and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies to hit $1 trillion in market value.
""Google is a stock that won t get you fired,"" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who hasn t added to his current Alphabet position since the first quarter of 2019. “Will I be able to double my money in this stock from here? I m not sure about that.”
Alphabet s shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs  analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes. 
Despite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28% climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up. 
Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabet’s exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation. Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500. 
Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the company s costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said.
Alphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts  estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors  bullishness on the company: Alphabet s stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later.

Bearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July. Shares of the company are down nearly 7% over the last six months, compared with a 10% gain in the S&P 500 overall. "

Geopolitics overshadowed monetary policy for the first time in many months in early January. But such distractions tend to be short-lived nowadays, with investors getting back to central bank-watching swiftly. 
Rate-setters in many countries are about to hold their first policy meetings of 2020 - in Japan on Monday and Tuesday, Canada on Wednesday, Norway and the euro zone on Thursday. On Friday, China sets loan prime rates. In emerging markets, Indonesia and Malaysia bear watching on Wednesday - will they follow Turkey and South Africa by easing policy?
Japan, Canada, Norway and the European Central Bank (ECB) are not expected to make any changes, while it is unlikely China will act again so soon after its early-January reserve ratio cut for banks. The ECB, however, will launch its first strategy review since 2003 to rethink an inflation goal that has not been met for seven years.
Asset manager Pictet reckons at current prices, global stock markets have already priced over $2 trillion in central bank stimulus this year. But it predicts authorities will provide less than that, disappointing investors. So what policymakers say or signal at the meetings could well set the tone for equity markets, which have resumed scaling record highs.

2/DAVOS MAN
Now that U.S. President Donald Trump has dealt with China on trade for now, it is probably a matter of time before his wrath falls on Europe. On Tuesday, he gets a platform to express his views, speaking at the Davos World Economic Forum. 
While signing the Phase 1 deal with China, Trump already griped at having to ""pay for our money"" in a swipe at the euro zone s negative borrowing costs. He also blames the ""too high"" dollar for the huge U.S. current account deficit. A currency war risk therefore may not be too remote, especially in an election year. And remember, the Treasury already lists Switzerland, Germany, Italy and Ireland as suspected currency ""manipulators"" - all have trade surpluses with the United States.
Trump will not be short of sparring opportunities at Davos - some 53 heads of state are to show up in the Alpine resort, https://tmsnrt.rs/2HgY4lx including Germany s Angela Merkel. There will be 35 finance and 30 trade ministers. And given the green focus of this year s summit, 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg will attend. It is unclear if her paths will cross those of Trump who is well known for his scepticism over climate change and has advised Thunberg via Twitter to ""chill, Greta, chill"".

3/PMI ON BOE RADAR
Friday brings ""flash PMIs"" in many countries - advance readings of purchasing managers  business activity indexes. While the euro zone figures will be scrutinised to get a measure of economic recovery, British PMIs will grab more attention, given they comprise the last key data release before the Bank of England s (BOE) Jan. 30 meeting. 
A poor number, coming on top of a string of dismal data, could seal the case for easing policy immediately. As recently as Jan. 10, markets saw a 20% chance of a BOE move this month but on Jan. 13 that probability leapt to 50% and is now above 60%. Falling gilt yields and sterling also imply investors are bracing for a rate reduction.
Of course, those moves could be reversed if PMIs surprise to the upside. But a modestly positive reading may still not deter the bank from cutting rates this month. In any case, lower British interest rates are fully priced for May.

4/WATCHING NETFLIX     
When Netflix , the first of the so-called FAANGs (Facebook , Amazon , Apple , Netlix and Google ), reports Q4 results on Tuesday, investors will want to see how the streaming giant is coping with a wave of competition led by another entertainment heavyweight Walt  Disney   Co.
Launched last April, Disney+ looks like the most dangerous challenge yet to Netflix s dominance of an increasingly crowded video streaming market. Netflix shares are down about 8% since then, hit by worries over slowing subscriber growth and the costs of high-budget productions such as The Crown and The Irishman. Disney+, on the other hand, has risen 24%. 
Other competitors are on the horizon. Apple s new streaming service costs $5 per month, less than half Netflix s monthly standard price. And AT&T  will launch HBO Max in 2020.
Investors expect the stock to be volatile. Netflix options imply a 7.6% swing for the shares in either direction by next Friday, Jan. 24. Over the last eight quarters, on average, the shares moved 6% after the company reported results, according to Trade Alert.

5/EUROPE INC TURNING PAGE
European equities have endured a nine-month long profits recession but relief may be coming - I/B/E/S Refinitiv estimates show STOXX 600 companies in line for 2.5% earnings growth in the fourth 2019 quarter.
That is the good news. The bad news is markets are already at record highs, and that is after a 24% rally last year. Probably central banks  stimulus helped, alongside better Brexit and global trade headlines towards end-2019. But it does imply there is little fuel in the tank for further market gains. Currently, forecasts are for 2.5% profit growth in Q4 but that is already more than halved from two months ago. 
For 2020 as a whole, 8.8% growth is expected but again, subject to revisions. And while valuations are less exalted than U.S. peers, at 15 times forward earnings, they are hardly cheap. 
Sluggish economies mean challenging times for retailers, autos and banks. But turnaround expectations will be tested in coming days when lenders UBS, ING and Bankinter report, while semiconductor makers ASML and STMicro could show if the tech sector is starting to recover.

LONDON (Reuters) - With Google parent Alphabet  becoming the latest entrant to Wall Street s trillion-dollar club, Europe s blue-chip companies are dwarfed by comparison -- the most valuable firm from the ""old continent"", Nestle, is worth just a third of that.
Alphabet surged past the $1 trillion mark late on Thursday, joining Apple , Microsoft  and Amazon , which had breached that level in 2018 before giving up some of those gains. 
Add Facebook  (current worth: $630 billion) and you get a group with a combined market cap of $5.2 trillion, more than the combined $4.6 trillion value of the STOXX 50 European index (STOXX50).

Comparing entire benchmark stoc indexes, the U.S. S&P 500 (SPX) has a $27.5 trillion price tag, almost three times the $10.1 trillion on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX). 
There is no place for Europe at the global top 10 table where the cheapest company, JPMorgan , scrapes in at $430 billion, well above Nestle s $315 billion.

The main culprit for the huge discrepancy is Europe s lack of a digital bellwether stock to match the past decade s tech boom, spearheaded by the U.S.  FAANGs  (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix , Google) and China s  BATs  (Baidu ,  Alibaba   and Tencent). 
The FAANGs have transformed the U.S. equity landscape, with the Top 5 U.S. stocks accounting for almost a fifth of the market cap of the whole S&P500. Here s a trip down memory lane when oil majors and banks reigned supreme on Wall Street.

By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – Apple  rose on Friday as analysts continued to debate whether the upcoming launch of 5G iPhones will resurrect demand and trigger a wave of phone upgrades.

Morgan Stanley and Nomura raised their price targets on Apple, but have a different outlook on how much Apple s foray into 5G will boost iPhone upgrades.

  Morgan Stanley    raised its price target on Apple to $368 from $296, citing a peak in smartphone replacement cycles – the time customers take to replace their smartphones. 
The bank suggested that features such as longer battery life, 5G technology and ""aggressive"" iPhone trade-in offers implies the cycles ""can t stretch much further and may in fact begin to shrink.""

Nomura raised its price target on Apple to $280 from $225, but appears less optimistic over Apple s upcoming slate of 5G iPhones. The bank pointed to the previous drop in iPhone upgrades during the transition from 3G to 4G as a cautionary tale.
The expected $40 to $80 incremental bill of materials cost will likely also be a barrier to adoption, Nomura added.

But weaker iPhone demand does not carry the threat of impending doom for Apple as it once did.

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The S&P rounded off the week with another record close Friday as a surge in U.S. housing activity strengthened investor hopes the current economic expansion can continue.  

The S&P 500 added 0.39%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.34% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%. 

A surge in housing starts in December to a 13-year high, coupled with stronger-than-expected retail sales earlier this week and underpinned investor confidence in the economy boosting sentiment.

The trend of mostly bullish earnings, meanwhile, continued Friday as Schlumberger  reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
About 71% of the 44 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings have topped analysts  estimates, while 23% have fallen short, Refinitiv said, citing I/B/E/S data.

In a typical quarter, about 65% of companies beat estimates and 20% miss estimates, Refinitiv said.
Tech, which has played a leading role in the rally this week, continued its climb, led by Google , Apple  and chip stocks like Qualcomm .  

Fresh from hitting a $1-trillion valuation, Alphabet  tacked on further gains, rising 2% for the day.

Apple , meanwhile, rose 1% as Nomura and Morgan Stanley become the latest on Wall Street to upgrade their price targets on the iPhone maker.
Energy failed to join in the rally, as global oil demand concerns continued to keep a lid on oil prices.
The bullish end to the week comes as the U.S. and China signed off on their phase one trade deal on Wednesday, ending their two-year trade war.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reports from Netflix, Intel and Texas Instruments next week may hint at what is to come in the December quarterly earnings season, with some investors wary of possible danger signs that could knock Wall Street after its latest surge to record highs.
The S&P 500 has gotten off to a strong start in January, up 3% so far this year, fueled by a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, low interest rates and signs the economy remains healthy.
Analysts on average expect reports to show S&P 500 earnings per share fell 0.8% in the fourth quarter, with technology earnings seen up 0.6%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Investors are looking beyond fourth-quarter results at what companies may say about outlooks and plans for investment in light of the recently signed Phase 1 trade deal between Washington and Beijing.
Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter have already weakened slightly in the latest week as initial reports from big banks and a smattering of other companies filtered in.
""Most of the rally we had in 2019 was in anticipation of better earnings in 2020,"" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. ""Rather than getting caught up in what the Q4 numbers are, the attention will be on what - if any - revisions you get to Q1 and Q2 numbers.""
Analyst estimates for quarterly earnings tend to decline as any given quarter approaches, and any hint that estimates for 2020 are bucking that trend would be positive, Delwiche said.
The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT), which includes such market heavyweights as Apple , Intel  and Microsoft , has led Wall Street so far in 2020 with a nearly 6% gain. It is up 50% over the past year, the strongest performer over that period. The index is now trading at 22 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since around early 2005, according to Refinitiv s Datastream.
The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times expected earnings, similar to levels it briefly hit two years ago.
""There s going to be heightened attention to guidance to increase comfort levels with valuations, given the strength we ve seen in the last two months in the majority of tech names,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
Because of that, ""you re more likely to see slight disappointments punished more severely than positive guidance is rewarded,"" he added.
Underscoring the importance of results from Intel on Thursday and Apple on Jan. 28, the information technology sector is expected to have accounted for nearly 22% of total S&P 500 operating earnings in the last quarter of 2019, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""For a lot of the tech names, they seem to be well positioned for 2020,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Still, in the market overall, ""What has happened is the multiples expanded. And that s really the risk of the market.""
Technology earnings growth for 2020 is estimated at 10.4%, which is expected to contribute 2.0 percentage points to the S&P 500 s expected growth rate of 9.7%, according to Refinitiv s data, which would make tech the largest contributor.
Netflix s  quarterly report on Tuesday after the bell will show how well the video streaming giant is withstanding a wave of competition led by entertainment heavyweight Walt  Disney  Co .
Netflix shares stumbled last year on worries over slowing subscriber growth and ballooning costs of high-budget productions such as The Crown and The Irishman. Its shares are down nearly 8% since April 2019, when Disney+ was unveiled. Disney s stock has risen 24% since then.
Netflix shares tend to be volatile after it reports results, which could be the case again.
Netflix options imply a 7.6% swing for the shares in either direction by next Friday, Jan. 24. Over the last eight quarters, on average, the shares moved 6% after the company reported results, according to Trade Alert.
Seen as the chip industry bellwether, Texas Instruments   report and potential comments from management on Wednesday after the bell will provide evidence of whether a global downturn in semiconductor is bottoming out.
Expectations that the chip industry will soon pick up have fueled a 30% surge in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) since mid-2019."

BOULDER, Colo. (Reuters) - In April 2019, Tile.com, which helps users find lost or misplaced items, suddenly found itself competing with Apple Inc , after years of enjoying a mutually beneficial relationship with the iPhone maker.
Apple carried Tile on its app store and had sold its products at its stores since 2015. It had even showcased Tile s technology at a big event in 2018. The startup had sent an engineer to Apple s headquarters to develop a feature with the company s voice assistant, Siri.
Then, in early 2019, Tile s executives read news reports of Apple launching a hardware product, along with a service that resembled what Tile sold. In June, Apple stopped selling Tile s products in its stores and has since hired its engineer.
The smart-tracker startup was one of four companies that testified at the latest hearing of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee s antitrust subcommittee in Colorado on Friday. The smaller companies are seeking to urge Congress to look at how big tech use their considerable clout to hurt rivals.
Similar investigations are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission, and with a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states.
""After thoughtful consideration and months of bringing our concerns to Apple through regular... channels, Tile has made the decision to continue raising concerns over Apple s anti-competitive practices,"" Tile s general counsel Kirsten Daru told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing.
An Apple spokesman said the company has not built a business model around knowing a customer s location or the location of their device.
In September, House lawmakers asked more than 80 companies for information about how their businesses may have been harmed by anti-competitive behavior from Apple, Amazon , Facebook , and Alphabet s Google . In October, Committee Chairman David Cicilline said he expected to have a final report on its probe by the ""first part"" of 2019.
On Friday, Cicilline delivered a scathing statement against big tech. ""Companies... both large and small, have found themselves dependent on the arbitrary whim of these platform giants, one algorithm tweak away from ruin,"" Cicilline said.
""Because their decisions are largely unaccountable, opaque, and result in sweeping consequences, the dominant platforms effectively serve as private regulators,"" he said.
PopSockets, a seller of collapsible phone grips, testified against Amazon. The company s chief executive David Barnett said the firm started as a seller on Amazon s third-party marketplace and then sold items directly to Amazon as a vendor, but decided to end its relationship with the company after two years in 2018. 
Barnett said Amazon required PopSockets to pay almost $2 million in marketing so it could market its products as originals in the face of a wave of counterfeits. The online retailer ""frequently lowered their selling price of our product and then expected and needed us to help pay for the lost margin,"" he said.
""On multiple occasions we found that Amazon Retail was itself sourcing counterfeit PopGrips and selling them alongside our authentic products,"" he told lawmakers.
Amazon spokesman Jack Evans said PopSockets was free to choose which retailers it supplies and could choose to stop selling via Amazon. Third party sellers continue to sell the product on the platform. ""We ve continued to work with PopSockets to address our shared concerns about counterfeit,"" Evans said.
Basecamp, which sells an online project management tool, complained about Google allowing competitors to bid to have their own ads run when its trademarked name was typed into the search engine.
It said the practice allowed competitors to purchase ads that made it hard for consumers to reach Basecamp s website, co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing. The company has opened multiple trademark infringement investigations with Google but the process is ""onerous and slow,"" he said.
""Google s monopoly on internet search must be broken up for the sake of a fair marketplace,"" Hansson said. Basecamp is now forced to run a more than $70,000 annual advertising campaign to counteract the effect, he said.
Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said for trademarked terms like names of a business, the company s policy balances the interest of both users and advertisers.

Google allows competitors to bid on trademarked terms because that offers users more choice when they are searching, but if a trademark owner files a complaint, Google blocks competitors from using their actual name in the text of the advertisement, Castaneda said."

PASADENA, Calif. (Reuters) - The second season of Apple  Inc s ""The Morning Show"" will deal with the leadership vacuum created by the sexual misconduct scandal on the fictional news program and may or may not see the return of star Steve Carell, producers said on Sunday.
The show, a centerpiece of the new Apple TV+ streaming service, features Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon as co-anchors navigating gender and power dynamics.
Carell starred in the first season as disgraced former co-anchor Mitch Kessler who had been fired from the show and was trying to rebuild his reputation.
The actor has not signed on for the second season, and executive producer Michael Ellenberg told reporters at a Television Critics Association event on Sunday that there was ""no update"" on contract talks with Carell. Showrunner Kerry Ehrin previously has said she would like Carell to come back.
Producers said the new season will pick up where the first 10 episodes ended. The season finale showed a top network boss being publicly accused of helping to cover up the misconduct accusations.
""There is a whole new world order,"" Witherspoon said. ""It s chaos. No one knows who s in charge. What does leadership mean at this point?""
""Morning Show"" has earned Apple s first Hollywood award nominations since launching Apple TV+ in November. Actor Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice Award for his portrayal of network executive Cory Ellison in the series."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - South Korean thriller ""Parasite"" was the upset winner at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards on Sunday, while Joaquin Phoenix and Renee Zellweger were named best actors, cementing their roles as frontrunners at the Oscars next month.
""Parasite,"" the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, was the first film in a foreign language to win the top prize of best cast ensemble in the 26 year-history of the SAG awards.
Despite an unknown cast, it beat homegrown Hollywood movies ""The Irishman"" and ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood"" which both have A-list stars. 
The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
""Parasite"" director Bong Joon Ho said backstage that no-one could predict what might happen at the Oscars on Feb. 9 
Speaking through an interpreter he added; ""It is true that the momentum is building and we are a part of the awards race and campaign. But what happened today, what’s truly important, is that these actors were acknowledged by fellow peers as the best ensemble cast of this year.""
Phoenix s terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in ""Joker"" has swept awards season.
""I am standing on the shoulders of my favorite actor - Heath Ledger,"" Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the comic book villain.
Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic ""Judy.""
Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role as a charming stunt man in ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,"" while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix  domestic drama ""Marriage Story."" 
""It was a difficult part,"" quipped Pitt of his role. ""A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn t get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,"" he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob.
DISAPPOINTING NIGHT FOR  IRISHMAN 
Sexual harassment drama ""Bombshell"" went into Sunday s awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed.
Martin Scorsese s $170 million Netflix gangster movie ""The Irishman"" had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci.
Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG.
Those left out include immersive World War One film ""1917,"" the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as well as ""Joker,"" ""Marriage Story,"" and novel adaptation ""Little Women.""
De Niro, whose lead performance in ""The Irishman"" has been snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech to take a veiled shot at U.S. President Donald Trump.
In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her role as a TV anchor in ""The Morning Show,"" bringing the second award this year for the new Apple  TV+ streaming service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week.
Comedy ""The Marvelous Mrs Maisel"" and British royal drama ""The Crown"" took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But ""Mrs Maisel"" actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should have gone to quirky British comedy ""Fleabag."" 
Moments earlier, ""Fleabag"" creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a year of multiple awards for her and the show.

""This whole thing has been a dream and if I wake up tomorrow and find it s been just that, thank you. It s been the most beautiful dream,"" Waller-Bridge said."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Everyone knows that the global corporate tax system needs to be overhauled, Apple  Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Monday, backing changes to global rules that are currently under consideration.
The growth of internet giants such as Apple has pushed international tax rules to the limit, prompting the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to pursue global reforms over where multinational firms should be taxed.
The reforms being examined center around the booking of profits by multinational firms in low-tax countries such as Ireland where they have bases - and where Cook was speaking on Monday - rather than where most of their customers are.
""I think logically everybody knows it needs to be rehauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system. I m hopeful and optimistic that they (the OECD) will find something,"" Cook said.
""It s very complex to know how to tax a multinational... We desperately want it to be fair,"" the Apple CEO added after receiving an inaugural award from the Irish state agency responsible for attracting foreign companies recognizing the contribution of multinationals in the country.
Apple is one of Ireland s largest multinational employers with 6,000 workers and both it and the Irish government have gone to court to fight a European Union order that Apple must pay 13 billion euros ($14.41 billion) in back taxes to Dublin.
The appeal to the EU s second-highest court began in September and could run for years. Cook said Apple s belief that ""law should not retrofitted"" was at the heart of the case and that the company had great faith in the justice system.
Apple s commitment to Ireland, which became its first European operation in 1980, was ""unshakable"", Cook said.
The Apple chief executive also said that more regulation was needed in the area of privacy and must go further than the 2018 European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy laws that handed regulators there significantly more powers.
""I think more regulation is needed in this area, it is probably strange for a business person to be talking about regulation but it has become apparent that companies will not self-police in this area,"" he said.
""We were one of the first to endorse GDPR, we think it is overall extremely good, not only for Europe. We think it s necessary but not sufficient. You have to go further and that further is required to get privacy back to where it should be.""

(Reuters) - Emerging markets are the ""anti-bubble"" to increasingly expensive U.S. stocks, Barbara Ann Bernard, founder and chief investment officer of asset manager Wincrest Capital, said on Monday.
Lofty equity valuations of companies like Apple Inc  were dangerous, Bernard, whose investments include Saudi Arabian gyms and Indian shoe maker  Relaxo Footwears Ltd  , said in an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
Although the trend toward passive investing threatens the process of price discovery, it creates opportunities for investors willing to bet on overlooked stocks, Bernard said on the eve of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
Below are excerpts from the interview:
Question (Q) - Which countries do you find value in currently? Do emerging markets look appealing to you?
Answer (A) - Absolutely. Our fund is currently net short the U.S. market, not because we don t like the United States as a country, but rather, because we find twice the growth at half the multiple in Europe and emerging markets.
Last year, the earnings of the S&P 500 (SPX) were flat. Yet its price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) expanded from 14 times earnings to 19 times by year-end. People are paying more for less there today.
As value investors, we are interested in paying less for more and are agnostic as to where we look for that opportunity.
Q: What is your view on the FAANG group (Facebook , Amazon , Apple, Netflix  and Google ) of stocks, and in general, on U.S. tech valuations?
A: Things can be popular or safe, but in my experience, they are rarely both. FAANG is popular, but it is expensive, which makes it dangerous.
Today, the emerging market consumer is the ""anti-bubble"" to FAANG. For the market cap of Apple, you can buy every company in the four largest southeast Asian economies.
It is not normal, nor rational, to believe one company has a brighter future than several countries combined.
Q: What are your thoughts on quantitative easing s (QE)impact on value investing?
A: QE has distorted all valuations, not just in the public markets. With cheaper money, higher P/Es can be justified. But should they when you can still buy other markets at a discount with more growth and better yields?
You might have to look farther and work harder to uncover value today, but the harder we look the luckier we get.
Q: What is your view on the gradual fund flow from active investing to passive investing? Will passive flows eventually create more bubbles?
A: Today over 50% of the market is held by passive investors; three companies comprise 80% of that market share. I worry that this is eroding price discovery. I worry that more and more people are crowding into a room, but the exit door is still the same size. We have seen them indiscriminately buy, but we have not seen them sell."

The streaming service is among the top players in the crowded streaming landscape, competing with Netflix Inc , Apple  Inc s Apple TV+, and Amazon.com  Inc s Prime Video in the region.
Disney+ features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company s family entertainment catalog as well as new programming.

Investing.com -- Wall Street edged lower in early trade on Tuesday but pared premarket losses caused by a global wave of selling on fears of a possible epidemic in China.
Authorities have now confirmed six deaths from the so-called coronavirus, a pneumonia-like disease that is capable of being transmitted from person to person. The outbreak, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has shown signs of spreading throughout the country, triggering fears of a repeat of the 2002 SARS epidemic.

Airline stocks were particularly hard hit, with the ADRs of China Eastern  and China Southern Airlines fell 11.2% and 9.6% respectively on fears that an epidemic could hit passenger traffic. United Airlines  stock was the worst hit U.S. flyer, falling 2.6%, while Delta Air Lines  stock fell 1.6% and American Airlines  stock fell 2.0% by 10 AM ET (1500 GMT).

The Dow Jones Industrial Index lost 41 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell 8 points, or 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite also fell 0.1%.
Elsewhere, Uber  rose 2.8% to its highest since August after announcing it would retreat from its loss-making food delivery business in India. It’s selling the business to local rival Zomato in return for a 9.99% stake that will allow it to reap any eventual upside to a market that has yet to deliver decent returns.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) will join on Tuesday a growing number of companies signing a White House pledge to boost U.S. job training opportunities.
The third largest Japanese automaker will announce in Ohio it will provide expanded job training opportunities to 50,000 workers by 2025.
Other major companies including Alphabet Inc s  Google unit, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), American Airlines , Apple Inc  and General Motors Co  are among more than 400 firms that previously agreed to offer education and training opportunities for U.S. students and workers.
Rick Schostek, executive vice president of Honda North America, said in an interview that the company has long been committed to offering job training for its employees, but was trying to be more public about it. He said the 50,000 training figure ""was a bit more than in the past.""
Last week, Honda announced it had built its 20 millionth automobile in Ohio since launching production in 1982 in Marysville, Ohio.
Honda has not always seen eye to eye with the White House. The company drew the ire of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump when it joined three other automakers last summer in adopting a voluntary emissions deal with California.
It also was among Japanese automakers that expressed dismay with Trump s March 2019 declaration that some imported vehicles and parts posed a threat to U.S. national security.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has emphasized the significant U.S. investments and employment by Japanese automakers in an effort to head off potential punitive U.S. tariffs on imports of Japanese-made vehicles and parts.
Honda employs about 15,000 people in Ohio, a key state in the 2020 election and nearly two-thirds of all Honda automobiles sold in the United States last year were made in America."

(Reuters) - Attorneys for a former Apple Inc  executive on Tuesday will try to convince a skeptical judge of a core tenet of tech startup culture - that employees can plan a competing venture while still in a job.
Apple s lawsuit against a former chip executive-turned-rival will have implications for employees all over California who are considering striking out on their own and creating the startups that drive tech business and culture.
California s long-held public policy favors employee mobility in contrast to states that allow strong non-compete agreements. That stance allowed for the ""traitorous eight"" who left their jobs at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory for a rival in the late 1950s and who eventually spawned dozens of companies, including  Intel Corp  .
Apple filed the lawsuit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against Gerard Williams  III, who left the company last year after more than nine years as chief architect for the custom processors that power iPhones and iPads to start Nuvia Inc, which is designing chips for servers. 
Judge Mark H. Pierce last week issued a tentative ruling allowing the case to proceed but barring Apple from seeking punitive damages. Pierce will decide after a hearing on Tuesday whether to make his ruling final. 
Apple sued Williams in August, alleging that he breached an intellectual property agreement and a duty of loyalty to the company by planning his new startup while on company time at Apple, spending hours on the phone with colleagues who eventually joined the venture.
Apple declined to comment on the case. Through a spokesman, Williams declined to comment. Apple is not suing Nuvia itself or any of Williams  co-founders and it did not allege any intellectual property or trade secret theft.
According to a copy of Williams  agreement that Apple attached to its complaint, the contract required that Williams ""will not plan or engage in any other employment"" that competes with Apple or is directly related to the company.
In a filing in November, Williams argued that Apple s contract was unenforceable because California law allows employees to make some preparations to compete while still in their current job.
Even in California, there are limits, said Cliff Palefsky, a prominent San Francisco-based employment attorney. Workers can lay some plans for a competitor on their own time, but recruiting fellow employees on company time ""gets a little dicey.""
In his tentative ruling, Pierce wrote that ""an employee is not permitted to plan and prepare to create a competitive enterprise prior to termination if the employee does so on their employer’s time and with the employer’s resources.""
The case will likely hinge the specific facts of Williams  planning for Nuvia, Palefsky said. Given that work at modern tech jobs rarely sticks to traditional business hours, it may be difficult to untangle whether calls were made during company time or personal time.
""That phrase - that you can t plan to compete - raises a very interesting question of whether (Apple s contract) is violative of the public policy and whether the courts are going to enforce it,"" he said. ""This is going to be some groundbreaking stuff, one way or the other.""

The court has not set a trial date."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc  dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt backups of their devices in the company s iCloud service after the FBI complained that the move would harm investigations, six sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The tech giant s reversal, about two years ago, has not previously been reported. It shows how much Apple has been willing to help U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers  information.
The long-running tug of war between investigators  concerns about security and tech companies  desire for user privacy moved back into the public spotlight last week, as U.S. Attorney General William Barr took the rare step of publicly calling on Apple to unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a Pensacola, Florida naval base last month. 
U.S. President Donald Trump piled on, accusing Apple on Twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by ""killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements."" Republican and Democratic senators sounded a similar theme in a December hearing, threatening legislation against end-to-end encryption, citing unrecoverable evidence of crimes against children.
Apple did in fact did turn over the shooter s iCloud backups in the Pensacola case, and said it rejected the characterization that it ""has not provided substantive assistance."" 
Behind the scenes, Apple has provided the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with more sweeping help, not related to any specific probe. 
An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the company’s handling of the encryption issue or any discussions it has had with the FBI. The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on any discussions with Apple.
More than two years ago, Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users end-to-end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud, according to one current and three former FBI officials and one current and one former Apple employee.
Under that plan, primarily designed to thwart hackers, Apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data, meaning it would not be able to turn material over to authorities in a readable form even under court order. 
In private talks with Apple soon after, representatives of the FBI s cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan, arguing it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iPhone-using suspects, the government sources said. 
When Apple spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year, the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped, according to the six sources. Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan. 
""Legal killed it, for reasons you can imagine,"" another former Apple employee said he was told, without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision. 
That person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption. 
""They decided they weren t going to poke the bear anymore,"" the person said, referring to Apple s court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. 
Apple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the FBI. The government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone, a common occurrence in FBI investigations.
Two of the former FBI officials, who were not present in talks with Apple, told Reuters it appeared that the FBI s arguments that the backups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed. 
""It s because Apple was convinced,"" said one. ""Outside of that public spat over San Bernardino, Apple gets along with the federal government.""
However, a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons, such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often.
Once the decision was made, the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project - variously code-named Plesio and KeyDrop - were told to stop working on the effort, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
APPLE SHIFTS FOCUS
Apple s decision not to proceed with end-to-end encryption of iCloud backups made the FBI’s job easier. 
The agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone. But that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user, who is often the subject of the investigation.
Apple’s iCloud, on the other hand, can be searched in secret. In the first half of last year, the period covered by Apple’s most recent semiannual transparency report on requests for data it receives from government agencies, U.S. authorities armed with regular court papers asked for and obtained full device backups or other iCloud content in 1,568 cases, covering about 6,000 accounts.
The company said it turned over at least some data for 90% of the requests it received. It turns over data more often in response to secret U.S. intelligence court directives, which sought content from more than 18,000 accounts in the first half of 2019, the most recently reported six-month period. 
Had it proceeded with its plan, Apple would not have been able to turn over any readable data belonging to users who opted for end-to-end encryption.
Instead of protecting all of iCloud with end-to-end encryption, Apple has shifted to focus on protecting some of the most sensitive user information, such as saved passwords and health data.
But backed-up contact information and texts from iMessage, WhatsApp and other encrypted services remain available to Apple employees and authorities. 
Apple is not the only tech company to have removed its own access to customers  information. 
In October 2018, Alphabet Inc s  Google announced a similar system to Apple’s dropped plan for secure backups. The maker of Android software, which runs on about three-quarters of the world s mobile devices, said users could back up their data to its own cloud without trusting the company with the key.
Two people familiar with the project said Google gave no advance notice to governments, and picked a time to announce it when encryption was not in the news. 

The company continues to offer the service but declined to comment on how many users have taken up the option. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on Google’s service or the agency’s approach to it."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P ended in the red Tuesday as selling hit Wall Street following news that the deadly coronavirus had reached the U.S.

The S&P 500 lost 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.19% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.52%.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first case of the coronavirus in the United States.

The news was met with a wave of selling in airline and casino stocks on fears that a widespread outbreak could disrupt international tourism and dent economic growth.

American Airlines , United Airlines  fell more than 4%, while Delta Air Lines   fell nearly 3%.

In industrials, meanwhile, Boeing  slumped 3.3% after the aircraft maker pushed back its timetable for regulators to approve the return of the 737 MAX to the middle of the year. That added about 73 points to the Dow s losses.

A rise in real estate, however, led by Crown Castle , Macerich  and American Tower , helped stem broader-market losses.  

In tech, FANG stocks ended mostly in the red, led by Apple , offsetting gains in chipmakers Intel  and Micron .

Jefferies upgraded its rating on Intel  to hold from underperform, sending Intel 1.6% higher."

Investing.com - Netflix  delivered a quarterly earnings beat, but its weaker outlook on subscriber additions intensified fears that rising competition would rein in growth.
Following the launch of streaming services from Apple  and   Disney    last year, Netflix said it expected to add 7 million net subscribers in the first quarter, well below Wall Street expectations of 8.5 million. That is also below the 9.6 million subscribers added in the first quarter last year. 
Netflix blamed weaker guidance on higher churn levels in the U.S.
""Our Q1’20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are seeing in the U.S. plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with seasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019,"" Netflix said. ""This is due in part to the timing of last year’s price changes and a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we’ll have some of our bigger titles like La Casa De Papel (aka Money Heist) season 4.""
The streaming giant reported 550,000 U.S. and Canada streaming additions, missing forecasts of 611,000, but fared better internationally adding 8.33 million subscribers during the quarter, well above the 7.2 million expected.
 

Netflix announced earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 on revenue of $5.47 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $0.52 on revenue of $5.45 billion. That was in comparison with EPS of $0.30 on revenue of $4.19 billion in the same quarter a year before. Netflix  had announced EPS of $1.47 on revenue of $5.24 billion in the previous quarter.
Analysts are forecasting EPS of $1.21 and revenue of $5.76 billion in the next quarter. Netflix said it expects to report first-quarter revenue of $5.73 billion and earnings per share of $1.66. 
“The biggest challenge for Netflix in this dynamic situation is how to maintain a fine balance between growth and spending,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. ""The company’s huge content and marketing budget can only be justified if the company is adding more subscribers. If that doesn’t materialize, then its stock has to reflect that reality, especially when Netflix is borrowing to fuel growth,” 
“In our view, Netflix will continue to lag behind other mega tech stocks until investors are able to see a clear sign that the company is holding up well and can defend its turf. Strong subscription growth in 2020 is crucial to achieving that outcome.""

Netflix shares are up 4.58% since the start of the year and are trading at $338.40, still down 12.33% from its 52-week high of $385.99 set on May 1, 2019.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc  has entered a new year that will be far tougher than the one it left behind.
International growth helped the streaming video service trounce expectations in the last quarter of 2019.
But the company acknowledged competition had an impact in the United States, where growth missed Wall Street targets - and that competition will become more global as the Disney+ service launches across Europe in March.
Rivals including Walt  Disney   Co and Apple Inc  are now fighting for streaming customers, and Netflix said it expects to add 7 million subscribers globally in the first quarter, below analysts  average of 8.82 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For a company that has historically taken great pains to avoid mentioning competitive forces - it once called the video game Fortnite a bigger rival than other streaming services - it spent a considerable amount of time explaining why Disney s power will not have as damaging an effect on its engine of growth outside of America.
""Despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the U.S. on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters,"" the company wrote in a letter to investors. 
Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings described the fourth quarter s 8.76 million net subscriber growth - boosted by a new season of royal drama ""The Crown"" and two films nominated for Best Picture Oscars - as ""just amazing.""
That number beat Wall Street estimates for the fourth quarter, helping to send shares up 2.2% in volatile after-hours trading on Tuesday.
COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
The Disney+ and Apple TV+ streaming services both launched in the United States in November. Disney+, which is also live in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, will launch in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Austria and Switzerland on March 24. Apple TV+ is available in over 100 countries and regions.
The Disney+ service launched in the United States and Canada for $7 per month and $13 a month for a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu; it reached 10 million sign-ups on its first day. Apple TV+ launched Nov. 1 for $5 per month and is free for one year with the purchase of some Apple devices: its performance has been harder to define. AT&T-owner WarnerMedia s HBO Max will cost $15 per month when it launches in May.
Netflix is available in over 190 countries; its standard U.S. plan costs $13 per month.
Netflix has had an outsized impact on the pay TV landscape, changing the way that people consume TV and film and forcing media and tech companies to shift their business models. As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive, pushing Netflix to look overseas for growth.
As such, the company has invested heavily in non-English language content, and this quarter began releasing revenue and subscriber numbers by region for the first time. It added 1.75 million subscribers in Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, while Latin America grew by 2.04 million subscribers in the quarter. 
As rivals have pulled their content off of Netflix, the company has poured money into original TV series and films. It had a $15 billion cash budget for content last year and $14.76 billion in long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2019. 
""Friends"" left Netflix in the United States this month and will run on HBO Max. ""The Office"" is leaving the service at the end of 2020 and will be available on Comcast-owned NBCUniversals forthcoming Peacock streaming platform next year. 
""The streaming service s massive content and marketing budget can only be justified if the company is adding more subscribers at a robust rate. If that doesn t materialize, then its stock price will reflect that reality,"" wrote Haris Anwar, an analyst at investing.com.
The addition of new streaming platforms - taking more out of a household s monthly entertainment budget - has also made it harder for Netflix to raise prices, as it did in the United States last year.
Free, advertising-supported services such as Peacock and ViacomCBS-owned Pluto TV may also limit Netflix s pricing power, according to research from  Citigroup  . 
Net income rose to $587 million, or $1.30 per share, in the fourth quarter from $134 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose to $5.5 billion from $4.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $5.45 billion. 

The streaming giant said it added 8.76 million paid subscribers globally compared with expectations of 7.63 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Companies across China are handing out masks and warning staff to avoid the central Chinese city of Wuhan amid fears that the new flu-like coronavirus will rapidly spread with much of population embarking on travel for Lunar New Year holidays.
Firms from Foxconn (TW:2317) to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and  HSBC Holdings   have issued advisories, while the government has urged members of the public to be extra careful if showing symptoms of a fever or a cold and has asked travel and other companies to accommodate people who might be affected.
The death toll rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said.
At Foxconn s Lunar New Year party on Wednesday, founder Terry Gou advised Taiwan-based employees not to visit mainland China during the week-long holiday period.
""Colleagues and their families who have come back from Wuhan are all in isolation at home. The infection is spreading very fast,"" Gou added.
Company workers in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, have been wearing facemasks and getting their temperature checked, the Apple  supplier also said.
Huawei Technologies has asked staff to reduce travel to Wuhan and avoid contact with animals, adding that it had set up an outbreak prevention and control team in the city to carry out disinfecting activities, according to an internal note seen by Reuters.
 Citic  Securities (SS:600030) and investment bank China International Capital Corp (HK:3908) have asked employees to avoid trips to Wuhan and Hubei province, where the city is located, if they can, sources said, adding that if employees did travel there, they were required to report the trip.
Citic has also asked staff to voluntarily quarantine themselves if they do travel to Hubei.
Huawei and Citic Securities did not respond to requests for comment. A CICC representative declined to comment.
HSBC said it had advised employees that travel to Wuhan could continue but has asked them to be extra vigilant.
""We have stepped up cleaning measures at all our premises and all employees have been reminded to be more mindful of hygiene procedures and to stay at home or see a doctor if they feel unwell in any way,"" a spokeswoman said in an email.
Didi Chuxing, China s largest ride-hailing company, said this week it would issue masks and disinfectant to its drivers and would allow passengers and drivers in Wuhan to cancel trips for free in the days up to Jan. 31, adding that the company would bear the costs.
Travel booking platforms such as Trip.com  have said users can cancel travel plans to Wuhan for free, while Shanghai s Disneyland said it will waive rescheduling fees for entry and hotel ticket buyers within six months of the purchase date given that customers might be changing their travel plans.
Hong Kong s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) said it will allow passengers to Wuhan to change or cancel flights without charge through Feb. 15 and permit cabin crew to wear masks on flights to the mainland."

“It’s still on the cards, we made that very clear,” Al-Jadaan told Bloomberg TV in an interview in Davos. “We will consider it, but I don’t think it’s going to be anytime soon.”
Aramco raised $29.4 billion in the world’s biggest-ever initial public offering, selling shares at 32 riyals each and overtaking  Microsoft Corp  . and Apple Inc . as the most valuable listed company.
The oil giant’s IPO ended up being very different from what Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had envisaged when he first floated the idea in 2016 with an ambition to raise as much as $100 billion.
Aramco offered less than 2% and opted for a local listing after global investors balked at its hopes of valuing the company at $2 trillion. Instead, Aramco relied heavily on local investors and funds from neighboring Gulf Arab monarchies."

Trump Lauds Musk, ‘Disappointed’ With Boeing  (12 p.m.)
Trump praised on Tesla  Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk as “one of our great geniuses” but said he’s disappointed in  Boeing Co . over its woes around the 737 Max aircraft.
“I was worried about him, because he’s one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius,” Trump said of Musk in a CNBC interview. “You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that came up with originally the light bulb and the wheel and all of these things.”
On Boeing, he said: “Very disappointing company. This is one of the great companies of the world, let’s say as of a year ago, and then all of a sudden things happen. I am so disappointed in Boeing-- had a tremendous impact.
‘We Have to Act Now’ on Climate: von der Leyen (11:40 a.m.)
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen focused on climate change and geopolitics, the two priorities of her five-year mandate which started last month, when she addressed the forum.
“The window of opportunity is closing” to address the environment emergency but “we have to act now,” she said.
Von der Leyen said there has to be “fairness” when it comes to climate and that included protecting European businesses and workers from unfair competition.
“If you engage with Europe you will find a reliable partner, working for a more sustainable world, but we ask for fairness in return,” she said.
France’s Le Maire Hopeful on U.S. Digital-Tax Deal (11:35 a.m.)
France has agreed to put the taxation of digital companies on hold until the end of this year as it seeks to avert a trade war with the U.S., Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Bloomberg TV.
Le Maire said international rules for digital taxation would be “far more efficient” and “fairer,” and that he hoped for agreement with U.S. officials “in a few hours” after meetings in Davos.
“Entering into a trade war between the U.S. and Europe would be foolish,” Le Maire said. “And if we are ready to go this way, we would have one single taxation of all digital activities instead of having many national taxations all over the world.”
Trump Says Strong Dollar ‘Very Bad’ for Manufacturing (11:20 a.m.)
Trump reiterated his criticism of Federal Reserve policy, saying the central bank “brought up the rate too fast, and they didn’t drop it fast enough.”
“I want this dollar to be strong. I want it to be so powerful. I want it to be great. But if you lower the interest rates, so many good things would happen,” he told CNBC.
“We have a very strong dollar, and that sounds good, and it is good in many ways, but it’s very bad in terms of manufacturing,” he added.
Mnuchin Threatens Auto Tariffs to Counter Digital Taxes (11:16 a.m.)
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Mnuchin dangled the prospect of retaliatory tariffs on automobile imports if countries go ahead with digital taxation plans.
“If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies,” Mnuchin said during a panel discussion. “We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature.”
Internet companies have long been the target of complaints that they don’t pay enough in taxes, and France imposed a 3% levy on the digital revenue of companies that make their sales primarily in cyberspace, such as  Facebook Inc  . and Alphabet  Inc.’s Google.
On the same panel, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said the country plans to go ahead with a tax on digital services in April, with the levy designed to fall away once there’s international agreement on the issue.
Mnuchin said the U.S. will have private talks with the U.K. over the plan, just as Trump had with French President Emmanuel Macron to defuse the spat over digital tax.
Trump Would Be ‘Very Surprised’ to Have to Impose EU Tariffs (11 a.m.)
Trump said that he threatened von der Leyen with “very high tariffs” on “cars and other things that come into our country” at a meeting on Tuesday but that he would be “very surprised” if he had to implement them.
“They’ve taken advantage of our country, the European Union, for many, many years,” Trump told CNBC.
“They’re going to make a deal because they have to, they have to, they have no choice,” he added. “I would be very surprised if I had to implement the tariffs.”
The U.S. leader dismissed worries about a possible pandemic from a a new respiratory virus in China: “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.”
U.K’s Javid Says EU Trade-Deal Timetable Feasible (10:50 a.m.)
Britain and the European Union have set a “tight timetable” for negotiating a trade deal by the end of this year, but it “absolutely can be done,” according to the U.K.’s Javid.
“Both sides recognize that it’s a tight timetable, a lot needs to be put together in the time that we have, but it can be done,” Javid said during a panel on “The Future of Financial Markets.”
“And it can be done for both goods, where we want to see free trade, zero tariffs, zero quotas, but also on services,” he added. Work has also started on a trade agreement with the U.S., which is a “huge priority” for the new government, Javid said.
Mnuchin Says U.K. Trade Pact Is U.S. Priority (10:49 a.m.)
Securing a trade deal with the U.K. is a big priority for the Trump administration this year, Mnuchin said during the same panel discussion with the U.K.’s Javid.
Tariffs provided an incentive for China to sign the phase-one trade deal last week, Mnuchin said, adding that the U.S. is trying to open global markets, not close them. There are no deadlines to start talks on a second phase, which could be pursued in smaller increments.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the world is in a better place than it was a few months ago, as trade and industrial output bottom out and the outlook brightens.
Saudi Aramco’s International Listing Isn’t Coming Soon (10:21 a.m.)
The international listing of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) is “still on the cards” but likely won’t happen soon, Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan told Bloomberg TV.
In the oil giant’s IPO, Aramco opted for a local listing after global investors balked at its hopes of valuing the company at $2 trillion. Instead, Aramco relied heavily on local investors and funds from neighboring Gulf Arab monarchies.
Al-Jadaan said he’s “very confident” that the Saudi economy is picking up. After issuing a $5 billion eurobond, he said the country could borrow another $4 billion more this year and is considering debt in euros, riyals as well as sukuk.
AstraZeneca Sees Climate Change Bigger Risk Than China Virus (9:35 a.m.)
While the spread of the coronavirus is “a threat that must be taken seriously,” it appears to be relatively contained, AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
“I personally think there’s a much bigger threat that is facing the world today, and it’s global warming and climate change,” said Soriot. “We all need to do something about it.”
Thiam Says European Bank Mergers ‘Desirable’ (9:25 a.m.)
Consolidation among top European banks should be pursued, but work is still needed to convince taxpayers that larger lenders won’t be a threat to the financial system, according to  Credit Suisse   Group AG Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam.
“I think it’s desirable,” Thiam told Bloomberg TV when asked if European banking mergers should take place. “It will happen, but it will take some time. We still have a job to do to convince the public that larger banks can be safe and not endanger the whole economy.”
Thiam said he’s “moderately optimistic” about the euro-region economy and “still very positive” about the global economy. “It’s early days, but I think people are positive about 2020 and so are we. The U.S.-China agreement is very positive for markets,” he added.
Carney Bemoans Lack of U.S. Climate Engagement (9:22 a.m.)
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of mounting risks to the financial sector and the economy from climate change and urged the U.S. to play bigger role.
“Something which was largely on the periphery of finance has come into the mainstream,” Carney said at the Bloomberg Climate Forum. “Transition risk has become more important.”
Asked if the world could contain global warming without the U.S., the governor said: “It’s much more difficult.”
Messina Sees Future European Banking Champions (9:10 a.m.)
 Intesa Sanpaolo   SpA Chief Executive Officer Carlo Messina says Europe needs to create banks on the scale of JPMorgan Chase  & Co. in order to compete with the U.S. and China in geopolitics. That means common rules that could facilitate mergers across the bloc.
“If you look at Europe, U.S.A and China, you need absolutely to create some champions with scale that can compete with U.S.A.,” said Messina in a Bloomberg TV interview. “In the medium term in Europe, we need to have consolidation, but at the same time, we need to have rules of the game that could be the same in all the European countries. That is the problem of Europe.”
While these issues will unlikely be resolved this year, he said he expects it to happen in the future. The banking sector in Italy is under control, and Intesa’s non-performing loans are close to European levels, he added.
Staley Sees ‘Extraordinary’ Tech Valuations (8:45 a.m.)
Asset valuations are currently “quite high,” particularly in the tech sector, and vigilance is needed in case of a correction, according to Jes Staley, chief executive officer of  Barclays   Plc.
Asked in a Bloomberg TV interview what the biggest risk is to the economic outlook, Staley said: “Having been in this industry for some 40 years now, it generally starts with credit somewhere. People may get overextended and if there’s a shock to interest rates that could be quite a correction.”
Staley said there are “extraordinary valuations in some tech sectors, particularly the large tech players in the U.S.”
“When you have zero to negative interest rates almost by definition you’re going to have asset bubbles,” he added. “You want to ride that wave while it’s happening but keep your eyes wide open in case there’s a correction.”
After a tumultuous 12 months, Barclays is sticking to a strategy that keeps Staley in charge of its closely scrutinized investment bank, he added.
ABB Chairman Sees Chance for Smaller Deals (8:09 a.m.)
ABB Ltd. sees potential for smaller divestments and acquisitions ahead as it refines its portfolio of businesses, Chairman Peter Voser said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
The Swiss engineering company has identified units with 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in revenue that it plans to fix or sell. As that program continues, ABB is also expanding its reach, such as its purchase of a stake in a Chinese electric-car charging company last year. But bigger deals aren’t planned, Voser said.
“There is no talk about bigger portfolio transactions at this stage,” he said, adding that the focus of the new CEO will be on improving ABB’s operational performance and executing on the board’s strategic plan.
Fake News Is Biggest Risk: Malaysia’s Leiking (7:28 a.m.)
Malaysian Trade Minister Darell Leiking said recent indicators such as purchasing managers’ indexes suggest the economic outlook is positive.
“Continuously, we see encouraging PMI results all over the world, Malaysia as well,” Leiking said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We hope that some positiveness will continue throughout this year. The biggest risk for the Malaysian economy is a lot of fake news about things.”
Malaysia is unlikely to suffer any loss in its palm oil business from China, despite Beijing pledging to boost soybean purchases from the U.S. amid the trade war, Leiking added.
UBS Focused on Gaining U.S. Market Share (7:22 a.m.)
UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber said the Swiss bank wants to focus on its wealthy clients and expand particularly in the U.S.
“We now want to focus on efficiency in wealth management,” Weber said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “We want to maintain our No. 1 one position globally, and we want to build the market where we’re not among the top four and that is in the U.S. And really build that part.”
Negative interest rates in Europe are more a distortion than a useful tool, Weber added.
Zimbabwe Dealing With Inflation: Ncube (6:50 a.m.)
Zimbabwe is on track in dealing with inflation, even with consumer prices increasing more than 500% on an annual basis, according to Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube.
Annual inflation remains high, “but that’s expected, that happens when you liberalize a currency,” Ncube told Bloomberg TV. “We believe are on our way to deal with inflation. It will take time, but we are headed there,” Ncube said.

8:50 AM ET: Apple  stock was up 0.7% after a Bloomberg report saying that the company was preparing to start manufacturing its new cut-price iPhone in February. The company has said it expects an upsurge in demand for phones this year as companies roll out 5G services.
8:43 AM ET:   Capital One    stock was up 2.4% and closing in a new 12-month high after the lender beat consensus forecasts for earnings and revenue after the bell on Tuesday.
08:39 AM ET: Netflix  stock was down 0.5%, but vacillating around last night’s closing price, after a mixed set of earnings that showed international subscriber growth well ahead of forecasts, but a third-straight miss on subscribers in the more saturated U.S. market. Analysts saw the signs of growing competition in the U.S. streaming space, a phenomenon which is likely to replicate itself abroad in the long term.

Hours after the company made the announcement https://blog.sonos.com/en/end-of-software-updates-for-legacy-products on Tuesday, customers went on Twitter using the trending hashtag #SonosBoycott and tagging the company s chief executive officer, Patrick Spence, with their questions.
""@Patrick_Spence would you like to buy my 3 yr old @Sonos equipment? I guess you know how to use it as a doorstop soon,"" one Twitter user, @itnopred, asked the CEO.
Customers received an email from Sonos saying the company would no longer support some models launched between 2006 and 2009 after May.
Sonos gave customers the option to either continue using the products without any new updates and features in the future or buy a new Sonos product with a 30% credit for each product replaced.
""Is this some kind of sick joke? ... How to kill a brand 101. Your discount is a joke,"" @Ben_Willee tweeted.
Spence has not personally responded to Twitter users, but the Sonos support team has been replying to irate customers.
""As this is the first time we ve had to end software updates for any music player, we recognize this is new for Sonos owners, just as it is for Sonos,"" a Sonos spokesman said in a statement.
""We ve now come to the point where our oldest products have been stretched to their technical limits in terms of memory and processing power.""
Sonos  speakers and the company s tie-ups with around 100 music streaming providers, including Apple  Music and Spotify , have attracted audiophiles around the world. The company, founded in 2002, listed on the stock exchange in 2018.
But as Amazon  Inc s Echo, Google s Home and Apple s HomePod entered the market, the Santa Barbara, California-based company faced pressure over pricing and the variety of its products.
""This is nothing more than a big rip off by a company that just went public ... I will never purchase their products again. I hope they go bankrupt,"" Facebook  user Stephen Salay posted in a private group for Sonos users.
Many customers also highlighted the environmental aspect of the move at a time when people are buying more and more devices and then abandoning them quickly, increasing landfill waste.

Shares of the company were down 1.2% at $14.62 in early trading on Wednesday."

But executives largely brushed off the long-term global impact of rivals that also include Apple , Comcast  Corp s NBCUniversal and AT&T Inc.
So too did Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.
""Despite new services on the horizon from  Disney  and Apple (and probably others), we expect minimal long-term impact to Netflix subscriber addition and retention,"" Piper Sandler analyst Michael Olson said.
At least four brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Monness Crespi Hardt being the most bullish, hiking it by $50 to $400, in-line with the median price target.
Netflix beat global paid subscriber estimates in the fourth-quarter, boosted by returning series ""The Crown"", Oscar contender ""The Irishman"" as well as its adapted series ""The Witcher"".
In the United States, however, the company s growth missed Wall Street s targets. Shares of the company were down 2% in morning trade.
The crowded market for video streaming is currently dominated by Netflix, but investors have worried about the impact of increasing competition from the roll out of Walt Disney  Co s Disney+ and Apple Inc s Apple TV+.
This year, consumers will also have to choose among new entrants that include AT&T s HBO Max and NBCUniversal s Peacock streaming video services.
Disney+, which launched in November, reached 10 million sign-ups on its first day and features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company s family entertainment catalog as well as new programming. It also includes ""The Mandalorian,"" the first live action TV series in the ""Star Wars"" franchise.
Disney also said on Tuesday it had moved up the launch of Disney+ by a week to March 24 in the United Kingdom and in regions across Western Europe.
The company is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.
On Tuesday, Netflix executives said new competitors hurt traditional television businesses more than Netflix and its rivals."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P continued to flirt with record intraday highs Wednesday, led by a rally in tech on the back of bullish earnings from   IBM    and improved sentiment on chip stocks.

The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow gained 0.15% and the Nasdaq Composite was up almost 0.6%.

 IBM   led the rally in tech, rising 3% as Big Blue s better-than-expected quarterly results were greeted by several endorsements from Wall Street.

Morgan Stanley raised its price target on  IBM   to $164 from $155, but said the return to revenue growth for the company was driven by ""less sustainable"" tailwinds like the new Red Hat unit and currency gains.

Cantor Fitzgerald and   Citigroup    also raised their price targets on IBM.

Chip stocks also powered the broader averages to intraday highs as a sunnier outlook from chipmaker ASML  stoked sentiment on the sector ahead of key earnings from chip bellwether Texas Instruments  after the closing bell.

But Netflix  fell 2% as its weaker outlook on growth for the first quarter raised concerns about the impact of rising competition from rivals like   Disney    and Apple .

Against the backdrop of gains in tech, industrials remained under pressure as Boeing  struggled to gain its footing following an announcement that its 737 Max would likely be grounded until mid-2020.

Boeing said its decision to advise customers its grounded 737 Max jet was unlikely to be recertified until mid-year was not due to any new technical issues"

The vulnerabilities were found in a tool specifically designed to protect privacy and could have allowed third parties to obtain sensitive information about the browsing habits of users, the report added.
Alphabet  Inc s Google disclosed the flaws to Apple last August, according to the report. In a blog post in December, an Apple engineer said that the company had fixed flaws disclosed to it by Google researchers.

(Reuters) - Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics would still reach its mid-term revenue target in the event of a ban of Huawei telecoms components in Europe, its chief executive said after the group published better-than-expected earnings on growing demand for its next-generation products.
Debates are raging in France, Germany and Britain as to whether to grant China s Huawei, one of STMicro s top 10 clients globally, the right to sell its telecoms equipment for use in 5G mobile Internet infrastructure, following calls by U.S. authorities for a complete ban over fears China could use the equipment for spying. 
""We re prepared for it,"" STMicro Chief Executive Officer Jean-March Chery said in an interview, when asked if the company had assessed the risk of a full ban. 
""Today, the risks and opportunities are balanced and won t prevent us from reaching our mid-term target of $12 billion,"" he added. The Geneva-based group pledged to reach that revenue goal by the second-half of 2021 or in 2022, depending on market conditions. 
STMicro, whose controlling shareholders are France and Germany, is able to shift manufacturing from China to countries like Morocco and Malaysia, if the trade relationship between China and the United States deteriorates further, Chery said. 
""We re going to move from a totally open global economy to an economy that will be more siloed, with regional strategic interests that will come before that of companies,"" he said. 
STMicro s fourth-quarter results beat analysts estimates as demand for chips dedicated to the next generation of smartphones and low-emission cars helped offset a slowdown in more traditional products. 
STMicro s results reflect a wider industry move towards more sophisticated semiconductors within the telecoms, auto and manufacturing sectors, as equipment makers gear up for the deployment of the new mobile Internet infrastructure, or 5G, and increased demand for cleaner vehicles. 
The supplier to iPhone maker Apple  and electric carmaker Tesla  said fourth-quarter net revenue rose by 7.9% from the previous quarter to $2.75 billion, above STMicro s targets.
The gross margin for the period stood at 39.3 percent. Shares jumped over 8% by 1348 GMT.
The Geneva-based company expects first-quarter sales to fall by 14% to about $2.36 billion from the last quarter of 2019, as the start of the year is generally a weaker period in the semiconductor industry. STMicro expects growth of 13.7% over the period from a year earlier.
It also plans to invest about $1.5 billion in capital expenditure in 2020.

STMicro s results came on the back of a good performance by bigger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which forecast a rise of up to 45% in January-March revenue earlier this month."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - iPhone maker Apple  on Thursday pushed back against EU lawmakers  call for a common charger, warning the move could hamper innovation, create a mountain of electronic waste and irk consumers.
Apple s comments came a week after lawmakers at the European Parliament called for a common charger for all mobile phones and amended a draft law to say the ability to work with common chargers would be an essential requirement for radio equipment in the bloc.
A move to a common charger would affect Apple more than any other companies as its iPhones and most of its products are powered by its Lightning cable, whereas Android devices are powered by USB-C connectors.
""We believe regulation that forces conformity across the type of connector built into all smartphones stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, and would harm consumers in Europe and the economy as a whole,"" Apple said in a statement.
It said regulation was not needed as the industry is already moving to USB-C through a connector or cable assembly. 
""We hope the (European) Commission will continue to seek a solution that does not restrict the industry s ability to innovate,"" Apple said.
A study by Copenhagen Economics commissioned by Apple showed that consumer harm from a regulatory-mandated move to a common charger would cost at least 1.5 billion euros, outweighing the 13 million euros in associated environmental benefits.
The European Commission, which acts as the executive for the EU, has been pushing for a common charger for more than a decade.
In 2009 it got four companies including Apple, Samsung (KS:005930), Huawei [HWT.UL] and Nokia  to sign a voluntary memorandum of understanding to harmonize chargers for new models of smartphones coming into the market in 2011.
The voluntary approach is not working and it is time to look into legislation, Commission officials said.
""A delegated act based on the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) is one of the options to be considered since it empowers the Commission to take certain type of regulatory measures in this field,"" the one of the officials said. 
Another option was to pass legislation on the issue.
""...given the limitation in the scope of RED and of its empowerment, any action through ordinary legislative procedure and/or through other instruments, such as implementing measures under the Eco-design Directive should be further explored and thoroughly assessed,"" the official said.

The Commission will publish a study around the end of the month or early February on the impact of a common charger."

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Netflix  surged on Thursday as one analyst suggested the streaming giant may be set to win big as Comcast s subscriber losses indicate cord cutting is far from over.

Comcast  reported a net loss of 133,000 residential video subscribers and warned that the pace of subscriber loss may continue, many of whom may likely turn to Netflix for the streaming needs, said Stifel analyst Scott Devitt 

""Comparing Netflix to introductory pricing and/or inferior over-the-top products as a justification for worrying about the competitive climate is missing the fact that the cable, telecom and satellite video industry (where all the money is) is shrinking with no end in sight,"" Devitt says.

The bullish note on Netflix comes just days after the streaming giant reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but projected weaker subscription additions than expected for the current quarter.

Netflix projected a gain of 7 million paid subscribers worldwide in the first quarter, missing estimates of the 7.82 million.

(Reuters) - In the run-up to the U.S. 2020 presidential election, many Democratic White House contenders have argued in favor of either breaking up or tightening regulation of companies such as  Facebook Inc  , Alphabet Inc s Google  and Amazon.com Inc .
Republican President Donald Trump s administration has also stepped up its scrutiny of Big Tech, conducting a wide-ranging probe into whether major digital tech companies engaged in anticompetitive practices.
Social media platforms are under particular scrutiny over their efforts to curb dissemination of misinformation and false claims, years after U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia used them to wage an influence operation aimed at interfering with the 2016 election. Moscow has denied the claim.
Here are the leading presidential candidates  positions on Big Tech.
PRESIDENT TRUMP
Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has stopped short of calling for tech giants to be broken up, but said ""obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,"" when asked about major tech companies in the past.
Trump s Department of Justice announced in July it was conducting an antitrust review of ""market-leading online platforms.""
Big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple Inc  and Amazon also face a slew of U.S. antitrust probes by the federal government, state attorneys general and Congress.
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN
Biden slammed big tech companies in a January interview with the New York Times, saying he had ""never been a fan of Facebook"" and arguing that online platforms should not be allowed immunity for content posted by users.
He also clashed with Facebook and Google over their political ad policies after they refused to take down a Trump ad that the Biden team said contained false claims about his son Hunter s dealings with Ukraine.
Biden, who was vice president in the Silicon Valley-friendly Obama administration, has said that splitting up companies such as Facebook was ""something we should take a really hard look at"" but that it was ""premature"" to make a final judgment.
U.S. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN
Warren is leading the charge to break up big tech companies on the grounds they hold outsized influence and stifle competition.
She has called for legislation to restrict large tech platforms - which she would designate as ""platform utilities"" -from owning and participating in a marketplace at the same time. Under this law, Apple would not be allowed to both run the App Store and sell its own apps on it, for example.
The senator from Massachusetts also said she would nominate regulators to unwind anticompetitive mergers such as Facebook s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, and Amazon s deal for the Whole Foods supermarket chain.
Warren has criticized Facebook s policy of exempting politicians  ads from fact-checking, running deliberately false ads that claimed Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump s re-election bid.
U.S. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS
Sanders, who frequently criticizes corporate influence, has also called for the breakup of big tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon.
The Vermont lawmaker has also said that he will have the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) review all mergers that have taken place during the Trump administration. His broad plan to reshape corporate America would also mandate all large companies be owned partly by their workers.
Sanders has been particularly vocal in his attacks on Amazon over its tax contributions and working conditions at its warehouses.
PETE BUTTIGIEG
In general, Pete Buttigieg, who became Facebook s 287th user shortly after it was launched in 2004 at Harvard University, where he was a student, has been more reluctant to slam the tech giants than some other candidates.
Though he has said that the breakup of big tech companies ""should be on the table,"" the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor does not think it is a politician s place to designate which companies should be broken up.
U.S. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR
Klobuchar has made oversight of big technology companies one of her major issues in Congress and argued for data privacy laws and net neutrality safeguards as priorities at her campaign launch in February.
She has not endorsed Warren s plan for their breakup, saying that she would first want investigations. Her plan for her first 100 days in office includes an ""aggressive retrospective review of mergers,"" which she said she would pay for with an extra merger fee on ""megamergers.""
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG
Former New York City Mayor Bloomberg told the Bay Area News Group in January that breaking up big tech companies ""just to be nasty is not an answer"" and that he does not think Senators Warren and Sanders ""know what they re talking about"" on the issue. He said he was open to more limited antitrust enforcement.
The billionaire media mogul, who has launched a television and digital ad blitz, says online platforms should be legally treated the same as news publications. As the founder of Bloomberg News, he made his fortune selling financial information to Wall Street firms.
ANDREW YANG
Although Yang has said ""we would be well served"" if big tech companies were to break themselves up, he has argued that competition is not the answer to key problems with big tech.
Yang, the former chief executive of a start-up, has focused on the negative effects of tech on mental health and said he would create a Department of Attention Economy to look at how to responsibly design and use apps and devices.
Yang, who has benefited from a surge of grassroots social media supporters, told the New York Times in January that he did not ""have confidence that any of my opponents get the internet.""
TOM STEYER
California billionaire Steyer says that monopolies either have to be dismantled or regulated, but that to win against Trump, Democrats will have to ""show the American people that we don t just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies."""

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open higher Friday, helped by a strong tone in Europe amid signs of improving business confidence and a lessening of concerns over the impact of the pneumonia-like virus in China.

At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 31 points, or 0.3%, higher, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract rose 73 points, or 0.3%.
Late Thursday, the World Health Organization decided against calling the virus a global health emergency, despite the death toll in China rising to 25.
“Make no mistake, this is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said at a briefing in Geneva Thursday. 
Markets in mainland China and South Korea are shut, while Hong Kong closed early, down just 8 points, for lunar new year holidays.
Stock market gains were strong in Europe Friday, helped by improved sentiment in large parts of the continent’s business community.
The early readings of the PMI data showed Britain s vast services sector returned to growth in January for the first time since August, while a downturn in manufacturing eased. Businesses were more confident than expected in Germany, continuing the recent signs of a pick up in economic activity. The French release, by contrast, was hit by the strikes against President Emmanuel Macron s pension reform plans.

At 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), the German DAX was 1.4% higher, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.6%, France’s CAC 40 gained 1.1%, and the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, up 1.3%.

Eyes will now turn to the release of the equivalent U.S. PMI data, at 0945 AM ET (1445 GMT). The manufacturing PMI was revised slightly lower to 52.4 from 52.5 in December of 2019. This release averaged 53.63 points from 2012 until 2019, reaching an all time high of 57.90 points in August of 2014.
In corporate news, Intel  will be in focus after the tech giant published strong fourth quarter results, with sales up eight per cent to $20.21bn, compared with the $19.23 billion expected. Shares stood 5.6% higher premarket.
Shares in Broadcom  climbed 2.4% premarket after it disclosed late Thursday new deals with Apple , worth $15 billion, to supply the iPhone manufacturer with components. 

By contrast, Skyworks  Solutions dropped 2.9% in premarket despite beating expectations with its latest quarterly report and upbeat guidance. The company competes with Broadcom  to supply Apple .
Elsewhere, oil prices continued to show weakness, amid fears that the emergence of the deadly virus in China could reduce demand for crude from the world’s largest importer.

Wuhan in central China is the size of London. But these days, flights to and from the city are canceled, highways are shut and soldiers guard the railway station, as China tries to quarantine the center of a virus outbreak that had by Friday killed 26 people and infected hundreds globally. That s actually reassuring when compared to the secretive handling of the 2003 SARS epidemic. And the World Health Organisation says while this is ""an emergency in China"", it s not of international concern yet.
Still, it s unclear how deadly this illness is, or whether Beijing is revealing the full picture. Falls in share prices and the yuan show markets are pricing slower growth and a monetary policy response. The outbreak coincides with the Lunar New Year holiday -- peak season for traveling, entertaining and gift-giving. If spending on such services falls 10%, Chinese growth would slow 1.2 percentage points, S&P Global calculates.
A higher death toll or more cases overseas will put global growth at risk. The SARS crisis almost halved Asian air passenger demand, inflicting losses on airlines and the hospitality industry. Oil s 5% fall this week implies concerns for world growth are already building.

2/LONG FAANGS
Over the December holidays, people across the world will have shopped on Amazon , watched Netflix  shows and sent greetings over iPhones, Facebook  and Gmail. Soon we ll see how this played out in the bottom lines of the firms that are grouped together as FAANGs and collectively worth almost $4 trillion.
Q4 earnings from Netflix underwhelmed Wall Street. But Facebook should post 6.2% earnings growth on Jan. 29, while Apple  earnings, due Jan 28, are forecast to have grown 8.7%. Amazon has warned that higher investment spending will dampen earnings-per-share but it sees quarterly revenues up 18.7%.
Alphabet  (Google s parent), due the following week, should also post higher revenues but a 1.7% earnings decline.
Compare this with expectations for the S&P500 overall -- 0.8% earnings decline and 4.4% revenue growth. The FAANGs also have led the U.S. equity bull run; just since October, shares in some of them are up 20-40%, versus 11% for the index. Any disappointments may sink more shares than just the FAANGs.

3/EUROPEAN CAR CRASH
World stocks celebrated the China-U.S. trade truce by speeding into a New Year rally. But European auto shares have crashed out on signs they will be first in the firing line if a trade war erupts with Washington. President Donald Trump s latest threat to raise tariffs on car imports from the EU sent shivers down the spines of executives, who are already struggling with tough regulation, slowing demand in key markets and competition with electric vehicles.
No surprise then that European auto shares (SXAP) skidded towards their biggest weekly fall since October, shedding 3.5%, even as the pan-European equity index returned to record highs. In fact, auto shares have decoupled from Germany s DAX index since late-2019, hitting 10-year lows relative to that benchmark.
Making matters worse is another profit warning from Daimler, and a Citi ratings downgrade for  Renault  . Interestingly, auto sector earnings are expected grow almost 10% in Q4. But investors are bracing for nasty surprises.

4/BOE-ING
Britain leaves the European Union next week but the day will be little more than symbolic, given January 31 only marks the start of an 11-month period during which a new trade agreement will have to be thrashed out with the bloc.
Of greater interest arguably, is Thursday s Bank of England meeting -- Mark Carney s last as governor. The question is whether the BoE will join central bank peers in cutting interest rates. Economic growth and inflation took a hit from 3-1/2 years of Brexit uncertainty so a string of dismal data and dovish policymaker comment saw expectations for a cut swiftly build.
But money markets, having at one point priced a 70% chance of a quarter-point rate reduction, have trimmed those expectations to around 50%. Latest indicators, covering the period after the Dec. 12 election, suggest improving confidence. Sterling around $1.31, is in the middle of its trading range so far in 2020 - where it heads next hinges on the BOE s decision and forecasts for whether the economy will find more fuel when it starts a new life outside the EU.

5/FED WATCHLIST
The Fed must steer its first policy meeting of the 2020s between Scylla and Charybdis: U.S. stock indexes at nosebleed levels against Trumpian election-year pressure for lower rates.
The fed funds target will certainly be left in its 1.5% to 1.75% range on Wednesday; the central bank will want to see how the three cuts from 2019 are percolating through the economy. Also, considering fed funds spent the first half of the past decade near zero, there is barely room to cut more, without raising alarm about negative rates, deflation and asset prices.
A more immediate question is how long the Fed lets its banking system interventions run, now that the year-end has passed without any repo market turmoil. Its overnight operations will continue until at least mid-February but a debate is underway whether to establish a standing repo facility for banks. Investors will also watch for comments on the Fed s pivot back to balance sheet expansion.
President Trump is likely to deliver his verdict too. Advance fourth quarter GDP lands Thursday -- 2.1% growth is expected -- and Trump might repeat his argument that were it not for Fed policy tightening, growth would be near 4%.

The U.S. composite purchasing managers index published by consulting firm IHS Markit rose to 53.1 in January, ahead of forecasts for a dip to 52.5, thanks to robust activity in the services sector. The manufacturing PMI did, however, dip to 51.7 from 52.4, suggesting only moderate growth.

96,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/fiscal-policies-of-main-irish-parties-vying-for-power-2067417,2020-01-24,Fiscal policies of main Irish parties vying for power By Reuters,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland s two largest parties, the governing Fine Gael and main opposition Fianna Fail, laid out their economic policies in election manifestos on Friday ahead of a Feb. 8 poll.
While neighboring Britain s Labour and Conservative parties presented starkly opposing economic visions before an election there in December, Ireland s two broadly center-right rivals share similar policies on the economy and Brexit.
Polls suggest Fianna Fail may lead another minority government propped up by Fine Gael from the opposition benches, as Fianna Fail has done since 2016.
Here are some of the parties key fiscal policies:
SPENDING VERSUS TAX
Both parties have committed to staying within the 11 billion euros that Ireland s finance ministry forecasts will be available for tax cuts or additional current spending for 2021-2025. Fianna Fail says it will hold back 1.2 billion euros to account for demographic pressures and public pay increases beyond what the finance ministry has allowed for.
Fianna Fail would favor a 4:1 ratio of new spending to tax cuts, while Fine Gael has committed to a 3:1 ratio in favor of spending.
TAX CHANGES
Both are in favor of cutting income tax rates, but Fine Gael more so. Its policy centered around increasing the threshold at which workers pay the highest rate of income tax to 50,000 euros from 35,300 euros will leave an average earner just under 3,000 euros better off by 2025, the party says.
Fianna Fail s plans to increase the standard rate income tax band by 3,000 euros for a single person and 6,000 euros for a couple will put almost 1,400 euros back in the pocket of someone earning just under the average full-time wage.
Fianna Fail says it will reduce the capital gains tax rate to 25% from 33%. Fine Gael will review the rate at each budget over the next five years.
CORPORATION TAX
Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are committed to retaining the low 12.5% corporation tax rate, long a magnet for multinational firms like Apple , Google  and Facebook , among the country s largest employers. They also back the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as the forum for global tax reforms, rather than any action at an EU level.
PENSIONS
After emerging as an unexpected election issue, Fianna Fail has said that pending a review, it will defer a planned increase in the pension age to 67 in 2021 at a cost 217 million euros. Fine Gael recommitted to moving the qualifying age to 67 from 66 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.
Both parties plan to increase the state pension by 25 euros a week over the next five years.
HOUSING INCENTIVES
In a bid to help prospective buyers now paying record-high rents - another big election issue - Fine Gael said it would boost its tax rebate for first-time buyers to 30,000 euros from 20,000 euros. Fianna Fail would increase the limit to 25,000 euros while also introducing a savings scheme where the state would provide up to 10,000 euros more if a buyer saved three times that amount.
RAINY DAY FUND
Both parties have committed to making an annual deposit to the state s new contingency reserve set up to shield the treasury from potential future shocks. Fine Gael would add 500 million euros a year, Fianna Fail 750 million euros.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trillion-dollar market cap club expanded last week to a third U.S. company, with Google parent Alphabet Inc  topping the lofty valuation mark. Adding the next member, however, is likely to take a while.
Apple Inc  and  Microsoft Corp   are also worth more than $1 trillion on the stock market. And while Amazon.com Inc  is currently worth around $935 billion, the e-commerce leader did cross the trillion-dollar threshold briefly in September 2018.
The next closest company is not within $300 billion of the mark, but a handful companies could contend based on their current values.
Social media platform  Facebook Inc   appears to have the pole position. Its $630 billion market value is about $65 billion more than  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), the next richest company in the S&P 500 (SPX). 
But a lot can happen between now and $1 trillion, and investors asked to handicap the field revealed different choices among the S&P 500 (SPX) for which U.S. company will be the fifth member of the elite club. The next to join also may not yet be on anyone s list.

The following are among the top contenders to crack the $1 trillion market valuation mark:
FACEBOOK (Current market cap: $627 billion)
The social media company s stock price soared about 50% in the past year, and while past performance is no predictor, Facebook would top $1 trillion in just over a year if it keeps up that pace. 
To get there, Facebook ""must demonstrate the ability to monetize its user base beyond just selling ads,"" King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, said in an email.
Greater scrutiny of tech companies over privacy and data policies could limit Facebook s growth and stock valuation, according to investors.
Facebook is poised for above-market growth, said Margaret Reid, senior portfolio manager at The Private Bank at Union Bank. But ""that trillion dollar market cap might be further out the spectrum because of the regulatory environment for these technology platform companies,"" she added.
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ($561 billion)
Shares of Warren Buffett s conglomerate climbed more slowly than the broader market over the past few years, with its Class A shares up 11% in 2019 against a gain of nearly 29% for the S&P 500.
Berkshire s ""growth rate is less exciting, their valuation less likely to expand meaningfully,"" according to emailed comments from Jason Ware, chief investment officer with Albion Financial Group, who called the diversified company s earnings power and economic competitive advantages ""airtight.""
""They ll likely hit $1 trillion eventually, but they are the tortoise in this story.""
VISA ($446 billion)
Soaring stock prices have propelled  Visa Inc   and rival payments processing company Mastercard Inc  up the market cap chart.
Both could surpass Facebook in market value three years from now, if all three companies maintained their average annual stock price increases of the past three years.
With Visa shares trading at over 30 times forward 12-month earnings estimates and above their 10-year average market premium, according to Refinitiv Datastream, some investors are wary about its valuation. 
Albion s Ware said Visa s dominance in the credit and debit markets ""has afforded them highly visible recurring revenues and earnings and thus a stable market premium.""
If Visa s P/E ratio stays stable or expands, Ware said, the company could reach $1 trillion ""before many might expect.""
JP MORGAN ($428 billion)
 JP Morgan Chase  & Co  ranks as the largest U.S. bank by market value by well over $100 billion. Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, said in an email that the bank could grow even bigger.
""There will be some legislative issues with a very large JP Morgan,"" Nolte said. ""But continued consolidation within the banking sector along with international competition could push the large to get even larger.""

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – Walt   Disney    has hogged most of the headlines as the streaming wars intensify, casting a shadow over Apple , but new data shows that Apple TV+ racked in more subscribers than Disney+ in the fourth quarter.

Apple TV+ added 33.6 million U.S. subscribers in the fourth quarter, short of Netflix s 61.3 million and Amazon  Prime Video s 42 million, but ahead of the Disney+ figure of 23.2 million. Apple  was up 0.2%.

Despite launching a nearly two weeks before Disney+, AppleTV+ is still playing catch-up, and made its debut with only 11 series or movies available for streaming.  
Some suggest that Apple s impressive subscriber addition should be taken with a grain of salt as the strength of its streaming offering will be put to the test when the free one-year trial expires.

Under the current promotion, Apple TV+ subscribers are on a one-year free trial included with the purchase of any iPhone, iPad, Apple  TV, iPod touch, or Mac after Sept. 10, 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street fell in a broad sell-off on Friday, as investors fled equities on growing concerns over the scope of the coronavirus outbreak, capping the S&P 500 s worst week in six months.
All three major U.S. stock averages turned sharply negative, with the S&P 500 seeing its biggest one-day percentage drop in over three months after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the second case of the virus on U.S. soil, this time in Chicago.
S&P 500 and Dow wrapped up their worst week since August and the Nasdaq snapped a six-week winning streak. 
Market participants kept a wary eye on developments surrounding the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization (WHO) deemed ""an emergency in China,"" having now killed 26 people and infected more than 800 on the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday.
""Markets hate uncertainty and the virus has been enough to inject uncertainty in the markets,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. 
But some analysts believe the investors were looking for a reason to take money off the table. 
""The virus is really more an excuse to take profits right now,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. 
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, agreed. ""The markets are expensive and were looking for a reason to go down, and (the virus) is the excuse to do it."" 
Intel Corp s  stock surged 8.1% after reporting jumps in data center and cloud computing revenue and forecasting better-than-expected 2020 earnings.

Fourth-quarter reporting season is well under way, with 74 companies in the S&P 500 having reported, 68.2% of which have beaten Wall Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now expect earnings to have contracted by 0.5%, on aggregate, in the October to December quarter.
Next week, a swarm of closely watched results are expected, notably from Apple Inc , McDonald s Corp ,  Starbucks Corp  , Tesla Inc , Amazon.com Inc ,  Boeing Co  ,  Facebook Inc   and  Caterpillar  Inc , among others.

New York (Reuters) - Wall Street is betting that the most popular U.S. technology and internet stocks can keep outshining the broader equities market but their latest rally leaves little room for error this earnings season. 
Investors dashed for the exits after Tuesday s less-than-stellar quarterly report from Netflix  - the N in FAANG - an acronym for the group of U.S. tech companies that have been the biggest drivers of the bull market.
Hopes remained high for the other FAANGs - Facebook , Apple , Amazon.com  and Google parent Alphabet , as well as Microsoft , ahead of their financial reports.
Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, Georgia describes the group as the ""Cadillacs"" of the technology sector, and said they should keep providing an outsized boost to the S&P 500.
""They re still going to be the show-business highlight stocks that everybody focuses on, and I expect them to do well,"" said Morgan, a long time technology stock investor. 
Analysts also see the group reporting faster revenue growth than the broader S&P 500 for the December quarter and faster earnings growth in some cases. 
However with recent gains among most of the group far outstripping the broader market, general equity strategists say the market s superstars may need to provide outsize positive surprises in their quarterly numbers and their forecasts for future growth.
In comparison to the S&P 500 s gain of roughly 12% from the start of October to Thursday s close, Apple rose about 43% while Facebook climbed about 24% and Google jumped almost 22%, just beating Microsoft s 20% advance. 
""We do believe there could be downside for the stocks if they do not over-deliver on earnings and narrative,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. ""To push the stocks higher from here, both earnings and guidance need to beat expectations.""
Here is a graphic looking at valuations for the group compared with the S&P 500 over the last year: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1502/1477/forwardPEfaanmgvsSPX.gif
The S&P 500 s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to decline 0.8% and revenue is seen rising 4.4%, according the latest estimates gathered by Refinitiv.
In comparison, Apple earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended in December are seen rising 8.7% while revenue could climb 4.8% year-on-year when it releases results on Jan. 28.
In comparison, Facebook, due to release fourth-quarter numbers on Jan. 29, is expected to report earnings growth of 6.2% on revenue that is estimated to grow 23.4% year-on-year. On the same day Microsoft is expected to post an earnings gain of 20% on revenue that is seen rising 9.9% for its fiscal second quarter ended in Dec. . 
On Jan. 30, Amazon.com is expected to report a revenue rise of 18.7% in the same timeframe, although earnings per share are seen declining more than 30% because it announced it would beef up investment in its package delivery business during the fourth quarter.
The last of the group due to report, Google s parent Alphabet, is expected to announce a decline of 1.7% for fourth-quarter earnings and a revenue increase of 19.5% in its Feb. 3 release.
Of all the group Morgan, at Synovus, favors Amazon most as he expects strong growth and profit margins in its cloud computing business. Plus, the stock has underperformed its peers, and the S&P 500, with a 8.6% gain since early October.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh favors Microsoft because of its ""great suite of products with no true replacement"" but also cites a solid outlook for Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet.
They re ""core holdings for so many managers that they would have to have serious issues for them to be sold. Plus, when people buy an index, they are buying a lot of these companies given the market weight cap of an index,"" said Forrest.   
But she added: ""They need to have a good enough quarter and forecast a better 2020 and be able to list the reasons why it ll be better than 2019.""
Ken Mahoney, chief executive of Mahoney Asset Management in Chestnut Ridge, New York, said Netflix faces tough new competition from companies including Apple and Walt  Disney  Co  but the rest of the group have ""wide moats,"" including consistent growth and strong balance sheets. But he is not buying more of the group, arguing that valuations are too high.

""I d look to add on some of these names in a pullback,"" said Mahoney."

By Noreen Burke 

Investing.com - Growing fears over the scope of the coronavirus outbreak are likely to keep global markets on edge this week, but a batch of closely watched tech earnings could shift investors’ attention away from the outbreak. After last week s less-than-stellar quarterly report from Netflix - the N in FAANG - Apple, Amazon and Facebook set to report their results. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England will both hold monetary policy meetings, with Thursday s BoE meeting the final one with Mark Carney at the helm and the last before Brexit. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Market participants are keeping a wary eye on developments surrounding the coronavirus outbreak which has infected more than 2,000 people, the vast majority in China where 56 people have died. The virus has also spread to the U.S., Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France and Canada.
With stocks close to all-time highs investors are fearful that the newly identified virus could develop into something worse, like the 2003 SARS epidemic.
""Markets hate uncertainty and the virus has been enough to inject uncertainty in the markets,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
The World Health Organization has stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can continue to contain the epidemic.

While last week’s Q4 earnings from Netflix  underwhelmed Wall Street, analyst hopes are still high for the other FAANGs - Facebook , Apple , Amazon  and Google parent Alphabet  - ahead of their financial results for the quarter.
The FAANG group of U.S. tech stocks have been the biggest drivers of the bull market, with recent gains among most of the group far outstripping the broader market.

Facebook is expected to post earnings growth of 6.2% when it reports on Wednesday, while Apple earnings, due a day earlier, are forecast to have grown 8.7%. Amazon has warned that increased investment in its package delivery business in the last quarter will weigh on earnings, but it sees quarterly revenues up 18.7% when it reports on Thursday.
In comparison, the S&P 500 s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to decline 0.8% and revenue is seen rising 4.4%, according the latest estimates compiled by Refinitiv.


The Fed will almost certainly keep monetary policy on hold on Wednesday as policymakers continue to assess how the three rate cuts from 2019 are percolating through the economy.
""With no new forecasts being released at this meeting it will be the tone of Jerome Powell’s press conference and the actual vote that is likely to be of most interest for markets,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
""We would also expect to hear Jerome Powell retaining his cautiously upbeat language, particularly given the positive conclusion to U.S.-China trade talks. He is likely to reiterate that we will need to see a “material change” for the Fed to consider a policy shift.""


The BoE is to deliver its final monetary policy decision before Britain exits the EU on Jan 31 on Thursday and the meeting will be Mark Carney s last as central bank governor.
The question is whether the BoE will join central bank peers in cutting interest rates. Economic growth and inflation took a hit from three-and-a-half years of Brexit uncertainty so a recent string of dismal data and comments by BoE officials, including Carney, that more economic stimulus might be needed saw rate cut expectations surge.
But economic data last week pointed to a post-election boost, leading markets to pare back expectations for a cut.

The future path of the British pound, currently trading at around $1.31, in the middle of its trading range so far in 2020 – hangs on the BoE s decision and forecasts for whether the economy will find more momentum after Brexit.


The U.S. is to release advance fourth quarter GDP figures on Thursday, with analysts forecasting growth of 2.1%. U.S. President Donald Trump might repeat his argument that if it were not for Fed policy tightening, growth would be closer to 4%.

The Euro Zone is to release GDP data on Friday, which is forecast to show the economy expanded 0.2% from the previous three months, backing up the European Central Bank’s view of “ongoing, but moderate growth.”"

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open sharply lower Monday, following weakness in Asia caused by a sharp escalation of Chinese measures to curtail the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
At 02:15 ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 137 points, or 1% lower. France s CAC 40 futures were down 72 points, or 1.2%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. dropped 63 points, or 0.9%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, fell 40 points, or 1.1%.

Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong are shut, but Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 2% lower and Brent crude futures continues to tumble, hitting their lowest level since October as traders priced in the hit to Chinese demand. 
Gold futures and government bonds rallied.

""According to recent clinical information, the virus s ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger,"" China s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said at a press briefing Sunday, adding that it is infectious in its incubation period, i.e. before symptoms show, making it harder to contain.

Nearly 2,000 people in China had been infected and 56 killed by the disease, Ma said Sunday, although Reuters reported later that the death toll has since increased to 80 and the number of confirmed cases to 2,744. Over the last week, both numbers have been rising at close to 50% a day.
“China has extended its New Year s holiday until 2 February in efforts to curb the virus and airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China,” said analyst Bjorn Tangaa Sillemann at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“However, with about 5 million residents leaving the city of Wuhan (where the virus originates) before the government shutdown of the city on Thursday, the job of containing the epidemic seems considerable,” he added.

Aside from worries over the impact of the virus in Asia, fresh economic data are thin on the ground in Europe Monday while the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve that ends on Wednesday coupled with the Bank of England s meeting on Thursday could keep a lid on activity.
Turning to corporate earnings, most eyes will be on the U.S. this week as tech giants Facebook , Apple , Amazon  and Google parent Alphabet  are all due to report their financial results for the final quarter of 2019.
Elsewhere, worries about the extent of the hit to the demand for oil from China on the back of the shutdown in activity to curtail the spread of the virus continues to weigh on the price of oil."

Investing.com - European stock markets traded strongly lower Monday, in a broad risk off move on the back of the sharp escalation of Chinese measures to curtail the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

At 04:15 ET (0915 GMT), the U.K. s FTSE index was trading 142 points, or 1.9%, lower, France s CAC 40 was 107 points, or 1.8%, lower, while the DAX dropped 223 points, or 1.7%. The Italian FTSE MIB index dropped a relatively light 0.7%, outperforming after political developments over the weekend. The Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 30 points, 0.8%.
Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong are shut, but Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 2% lower and Brent crude futures continued to tumble, hitting their lowest level since October as traders priced in the hit to Chinese demand.
U.S. crude futures traded 3.1% lower at $52.51 and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3% to $58.10. Gold, by contrast, rallied, with futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX were up 0.6% at $1,580.55.
""According to recent clinical information, the virus s ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger,"" China s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said at a press briefing Sunday, adding that it is infectious in its incubation period, i.e. before symptoms show, making it harder to contain.

“However, with about 5 million residents leaving the city of Wuhan (where the virus originates) before the government shutdown of the city on Thursday, the job of containing the epidemic seems considerable,” he added.
There have also been gains in sovereign bonds, and in particular in Italy after nationalist leader Matteo Salvini suffered a setback in his attempt to return to power when his party’s candidate disappointed in a regional election Sunday.
The yield on the 10-yr benchmark Italian government bond  dropped 17 basis points, while the spread between the 10-yr BTP and the 10-yr Bund fell 17 bps.
Turning back to the European equity markets, it’s the sectors which are strongly exposed to the Asian consumer which are hardest hit Monday. 

In the luxury sector, Burberry dropped 5.3%, LVMH fell 3.7% and Gucci owner   Kering    fell 4.1%, while in airlines, Lufthansa fell 4.5% and IAG , the parent company of British Airways, fell 5.2%. 

The one bright spot is the Italian banking sector, helped by the results of regional elections in Emilia Romagna over the weekend, where Matteo Salvini s Lega party failed to take control of the government from the ruling center-left Democratic Party and its allies.
The release of the German Ifo index also disappointed Monday, with the business climate indicator dropping back top 95.9 from 96.3 in December. An improvement had been expected after the gains in the ZEW and the PMI for the month.
Aside from worries over the impact of the virus in Asia, fresh economic data are thin on the ground in Europe Monday while the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve that ends on Wednesday coupled with the Bank of England s meeting on Thursday could keep a lid on activity.

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower Monday, as the pneumonia-like virus in China continues to spread despite the concerted efforts of local authorities, which threaten to put a big near-term damper on the Chinese economy.

At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 49 points, or 1.5%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq 180 points, or 2%, lower, while the Dow 30 futures contract fell 449 points, or 1.6%.

Losses have also been severe in the oil complex, as traders fret about the impact on demand for crude from China, the world’s largest importer.

By 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), U.S. crude futures had slumped 3.1% to $52.52 and the international benchmark Brent contract had fallen 3% to $58.09. 
The coronavirus outbreak in China has now killed 81 people and infected thousands and has already spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Australia and Singapore. The number of confirmed cases in the United States has risen to five.
The Chinese authorities have imposed travel restrictions, limited social gatherings and working hours and extended the Lunar New Year holidays nationally by three days to Feb. 2 to limit the spread of the virus.
“China’s health commission has said this morning that the epidemic is becoming more complicated to battle, said Peter Garnry, Head of Equity Strategy at Saxo Bank. “Our view is to respect the unknowns of viruses and that it comes with potential ugly nonlinearities.”
“From a tactical side traders should be on the short side in equities and the large gains from last year will likely be attempted to be locked in creating downside liquidity effects. For investors with a longer term view we believe reducing exposure somewhat or hedge market risk is a good precautionary step,” Garnry added.
That said, volumes could be limited Monday as the week ahead holds a number of key influences. 
Tech giants Facebook , Apple , Amazon  and Google parent Alphabet  are all due to release their earnings this week for the final quarter of 2019, starting with Apple Tuesday.

The Federal Reserve is set to hold a rate-setting meeting this week, concluding on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold as policymakers continue to assess how the three rate cuts from 2019 are percolating through the economy.

Additionally, the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump continues. At the weekend, a New York Times report cited an unpublished manuscript from former national security adviser John Bolton saying Trump told him he wanted to freeze military aid to Ukraine - already approved by Congress - until its officials helped with investigations into the Biden family.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain is the United States  closest ally but their long friendship may be sorely tested as the two countries try to forge a new trade agreement after Britain s exit from the European Union.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday in London that he was optimistic that a bilateral deal with Britain could be reached as soon as this year.
But Mnuchin gave up no ground after a second meeting with his UK counterpart, Sajid Javid. Javid has insisted that Britain will proceed with a unilateral digital services tax, despite a U.S. threat to levy retaliatory tariffs on British-made autos.
Mnuchin told reporters after Saturday s meeting that such taxes would discriminate against big U.S. tech companies like Alphabet  Inc s  Google, Apple Inc ,  Facebook Inc   and Amazon.com .
The UK Treasury declined to comment on the private meeting.
The divide highlights the challenges ahead as the Trump administration seeks a new bilateral agreement with Britain, part of a broader push to rebalance relations with nearly all its major trading partners.
The stakes are high - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pegged the trade deal with United States as a way to ease the pain of breaking with Europe, Britain s largest trade partner. U.S. President Donald Trump, has promised a ""massive"" trade deal to support Brexit, the product of a populist movement similar to his ""America First"" agenda. 
The goodwill and special relationship the two countries have enjoyed for decades may not count for much, experts say.
""Trump is not going to be doing Johnson any favors,"" said Amanda Sloat, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""He s not going to give him a trade deal without major concessions."" 
Even before the digital tax issue arose, the Trump administration threatened to tax foreign car imports, which could hit British-made Jaguar, Land Rover , Mini , and Honda Civic hatchback (T:7267) cars.
Stiff U.S. trade demands include increased access for U.S. farm goods, concessions that will be difficult for Britain s entrenched natural food culture to swallow.
The United States also wants Britain to change the way its National Health Service prices drugs and allow in more U.S. pharmaceuticals, which could prove politically unpopular for Johnson s government.
Washington s demand that London block Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for national security reasons could also cloud talks.
Reaching a meaningful deal will be ""exceedingly difficult,"" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""There are very deep-rooted issues on which the United States and the UK are diametrically opposed.""
Differences over those and other issues meant three years of U.S.-European Union trade negotiations ran aground during the Obama administration.
CAR TARIFF THREAT
Tensions boiled over at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Mnuchin raised the threat of car tariffs after Javid s pledge to proceed with the digital services tax. If officials ""just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we ll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies,"" Mnuchin said. 
British officials struck back.
""Let me be absolutely clear, UK tax policy is a matter for the UK chancellor, it s not a matter for the U.S., it s not a matter for the EU, it s not a matter for anybody else,"" Trade Minister Liz Truss said.
Britain exported $11 billion in passenger cars, engines, tires and other automotive components to the United States in 2018, the largest sector in a total of $127 billion in exports.
Eliminating the existing 2.5% U.S. car tariff and averting future auto tariffs will be a high priority for Britain in the talks. 
Britain will also seek greater access to U.S. state and local public procurement contracts, and services such as U.S. coastal shipping. But those are areas governed by U.S. laws, and a trade agreement may not apply.
CHLORINE CHICKEN 
The U.S. negotiating objectives published https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Summary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf last year by the U.S. Trade Representative s (USTR) office seek to grow U.S. farm exports to Britain. 
That includes the removal of non-tariff barriers, such as restrictions on chlorine-treated chicken, genetically modified crops and hormone-treated meat. Such products are common in the United States but shunned in Britain. 
The United States is also pressing for full market access for U.S. pharmaceutical products and medical devices. That would require changes to Britain s NHS pricing restrictions, and could increase the cost of drugs in Britain.
In comments https://www.phrma.org/-/media/Project/PhRMA/PhRMA-Org/PhRMA-Org/PDF/PhRMA-Comments-on-US-UK-Trade-Agreement.pdf to the USTR last year, a U.S. pharmaceutical trade group argued that the NHS  cost controls for pricing ""innovative"" drugs did not ""recognize their value to patients and society.""
That is not likely to sway British officials. ""The NHS is a religion in the UK. That s where the real red line is,"" said Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform in London. ""If the U.S. is saying:  Pay more for medicine,  that s quite difficult to get past the Treasury and the taxpayers.""
Some analysts say Washington s best bet is a limited ""Phase 1"" deal with Britain, as was recently signed with China. Such an agreement would not likely require approval by the U.S. Congress.
That would provide short-term political victories for both Britain s Johnson and Trump, said Lowe. Trump is seeking re-election in November.

A mini-deal could focus on financial services and convergence on some product and services regulations. It would fall far short of a deal that provides an alternative to Britain s unfettered access to the European Union that both Trump and Johnson have promised."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – Apple  was caught up in the intense selloff Monday, as many fret the impact of the coronavirus on Chinese New Year sales, but one analyst sees reason for optimism ahead of the iPhone maker s earnings due Tuesday.

China made up about 17% of Apple s total revenue last year, and the spread of the coronavirus has raised worries over the consumer impact on the highly anticipated Chinese New Year, Wedbush said.

Apple  fell 2%, but Wedbush said it would be buyers of the stock on weakness and reiterated its outperform rating and $400 price target.

The bulk of Apple sales in China and the surrounding countries has already taken place in the lead up to the holiday with a ""strong December and January likely already in the books with sales up markedly year over year and thus have helped drive a strong China region for Apple ,"" Wedbush added.

With as many as 48 cities in China reportedly on lockdown, transportation and foot traffic is limited in major cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. This would result in just 1 million iPhones, less than 3% of Chinese annual iPhone sales at most, in the region shifting out of the March quarter into the June quarter, Wedbush estimated.

The fundamental impact from this virus to Apple’s top line is ""negligible,"" according to Wedbush, as the tech company decided against cutting prices this year or introducing last-minute sales around the Chinese New Year, which had be seen in prior years to boost sales.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered their worst day in over three months on Monday as China extended the Lunar New Year holiday due to a virus outbreak, fueling worries about the economic impact of containment efforts in the world s second largest economy. 
The benchmark S&P 500 suffered its worst weekly performance since September last week as China locked down several cities and curbed travel, reminding investors of the deadly SARS virus that killed nearly 800 people in 2002-03 and cost the global economy billions.
Still, some investors viewed any long-term economic impact as unlikely, given past experiences with viral outbreaks. 
""This whole thing is way overblown,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""It seems to me the Chinese are doing a much better job of containing it than with SARS and what did SARS ultimately lead to? Did it lead to some sort of economic catastrophe - no."" 
After the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, the S&P rallied more than 10% from the start of the outbreak to the announcement of its containment. 
GRAPHIC-The S&P 500 rallied as SARS spread https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B59736G/sars-timeline.png
Travel-related stocks, including airlines, casinos and hotels, were among the hardest hit on Wall Street, while shares of sectors exposed to China s growth, including technology (SPLRCT), materials (SPLRCM) and energy (SPNY), pressured the markets. 
Adding to downside pressure was the sluggish start to corporate earnings season with indexes near record levels.
Earnings are now expected to show a decline of 0.5% for the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 87 companies that have reported though Monday morning, 67.8 have topped expectations, below the 74% rate from the past four quarters. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 453.93 points, or 1.57%, to 28,535.8, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 51.84 points, or 1.57%, to 3,243.63 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 175.60 points, or 1.89%, to 9,139.31. 
The Dow and S&P has their biggest one-day percentage drop since Oct. 2 while the Nasdaq s fall was its largest since Aug. 23. Wall Street s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index (VIX), reached 19.02, its highest since Oct. 10.
Technology and internet heavyweights that have powered the recent rally including Apple Inc ,  Microsoft Corp  , Alphabet Inc  and Amazon.com Inc , which account for about 15% of the S&P 500 weighting, lost at least 1.6%.
 Wynn Resorts Ltd  , Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd  and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp , which have large operations in China, plunged at least 5%. The NYSE Arca Airline index (XAL) dropped 3.32%. 
 Yum China Holdings Inc   tumbled 5.27% after the company said it had temporarily closed some of its KFC and Pizza Hut stores in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The rush to safe-haven assets sank U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year note (US10YT=RR) falling as low as 1.603%, its lowest since Oct. 10, and the yield curve between the two-year (US2YT=RR) and 5-year (US5YT=RR) inverting for the first time since Dec. 4, putting pressure on lenders. The S&P 500 banks index  was down 1.42%.
The S&P energy index (SPNY) dropped 2.76% as crude prices settled down about 2% on fears the outbreak would dent demand.
Fourth-quarter earnings will kick into high gear this week with 141 of the S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Microsoft Corp and  Boeing Co  , reporting. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.25-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 42 new highs and 92 new lows. 
About 8.11 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.31 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan 

1. Apple Readies Earnings; Investors Eye iPhone Revival
Apple  reports earnings after the bell on Tuesday, with many eager to see whether the its latest slate of phones has revived sales. 
Ahead of the earnings report, the spread of the coronavirus over the crucial Chinese New Year has cast doubt over iPhone sales in China. But Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said today the bulk of iPhone sales were already in the bag before the outbreak led to a lockdown of major cities in China.

“While China is a major part of our bull thesis and growth story of Apple for the coming 12 to 18 months, we do not view the impact of this virus epidemic as changing the numbers/merits behind the renaissance of growth in China for FY20/FY21 with a 5G super cycle the longer term driver,” Ives said.
Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar echoed the bullish sentiment.
“Apple’s push to expand its sales from services is clearly succeeding, while growth from iPhones is coming back,” Anwar said. “Any post earnings weakness, in our view, should be taken as a buying opportunity.”

Apple is expected to report earnings of $4.52 a share on revenue of $88.38 billion.

2. Here Comes the Rest of the Earnings Parade

While Apple takes the earnings spotlight, there are plenty more big-name earnings reports to move the market.
Three more Dow components will issue results ahead of trading:   Pfizer   , 3M  and United Technologies .
After the close of trading, Starbucks  will weigh in.

On average, analysts are predicting a profit of 76 cents per share on revenue of about $7 billion.
U.S. same-store sales are forecast to be up 5% for the quarter, according to FactSet.
The stock looks risky with U.S. and China performance fully priced in, Anwar said.

“But when the next pullback comes, this stock is an attractive buy-and-hold candidate for long-term investors, especially with its hefty dividend growth,” he added. “On the strategy side, Starbucks remains well on course as the chain wins back coffee drinkers not only in its home markets, but also in China.”  
Semiconductor bellwether Advanced Micro Devices  also reports postmarket.

AMD is forecast to report a profit of 31 cents per share, with revenue coming in at about $2.1 billion.
The “chipmaker is slowly expanding its market share and is well positioned to take advantage of lapses by Intel ,” Anwar said.

3. Durable Goods, Consumer Confidence Due

As the Federal Open Market Committee starts its two-day meeting on interest rates, there will be some more data to consider ahead of trading.

The Commerce Department will issues its December report on demand for long-lasting goods at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).

Durable goods orders are expected to have risen 0.3% last month, reversing a November decline, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.

Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are seen posting a 0.2% rise.
At 10:00 AM ET, the Conference Board releases its latest measure of consumer sentiment.

The S&P 500 Index fell the most in almost four months with chipmakers, cruise lines and casino operators among the hardest hit as investors fled companies with close links to China. A gauge of U.S. equity volatility surged above its one-year average. The offshore yuan sank, breaching key technical levels.
Equity Pounding Feels Awful But Is Pretty Much Right on Schedule
Investor concern that China has failed to contain the pneumonia-like virus -- which has killed at least 80 people and infected more than 2,700 -- roiled markets at the start of a week jam-packed with corporate earnings. The outbreak shattered a calm in markets that hasn’t seen a 1% up-or-down move in the S&P 500 since early October.
Traders Eye Technicals to Predict Where Latest Stock Rout Ends
“This is now a sell first, ask questions later situation,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. “Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty -- no one knows how badly it will impact the global economy. China is the biggest driver of global growth, so this couldn’t have started in a worse place.”
China’s financial markets will remain closed until next Monday after authorities extended the Lunar New Year break by three days as they grapple with the virus crisis.
Elsewhere, oil slipped to a more than three-month low, copper had its longest slump since 2014 and iron ore tumbled.

Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong are still shut, but Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 0.6% lower.

Earlier, the death toll from the new strain of coronavirus climbed to 106, with Beijing suffering its first victim, while the number of total confirmed cases in China surged to 4,515, the country’s National Health Commission said. All but six of those to die were in Wuhan, the city where the disease was first noticed. 
Though cases of the virus have been confirmed in other countries, no fatalities have been reported outside China.

The Chinese government has sealed off entire cities, isolating some 50 million people in the region around Wuhan, in the hope this will curb the spread of the disease. Long-distance buses and some public transport networks have also been shut down.

Wall Street closed sharply in the red Monday, with the S&P 500 down 1.6%, the Nasdaq Composite off 1.9% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.6%, more than 450 points. This followed on from hefty losses in Europe, with the DAX in Germany and France’s CAC 40 dropping 2.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 off 2.3%.

“Equities are finally beginning to contemplate the possibility that the virus 2019-nCoV in China will have significant economic impact,” said Peter Garnry, Head of Equity Strategy at Saxo Bank Group.
“The most sensitive sectors to the Chinese coronavirus and potential economic impact are materials, energy, industrials, IT and consumer discretionary,” he added.

Turning to corporate earnings, SAP SE will be in focus Tuesday after the leading provider of business software raised its revenue and profit outlook. 

However, most eyes will be on Wall Street as Apple  reports earnings after the bell, with many eager to see whether its latest slate of phones has revived sales.

The company has asked its suppliers, many of whom have manufacturing centers in China, to make up to 80 million iPhones in the first half of 2020, the Nikkei reported, citing people familiar with the company s plans. 
Apple has booked orders for up to 65 million of its older iPhones and up to 15 million units of a new cut-price model that it plans to unveil in March, according to the report.
However, the mass production which is due to start in the third week of February might be delayed due to the virus outbreak, the Nikkei reported.
The coronavirus outbreak has so far killed more than 100 people and infected over 4,500 in China, stranded tens of millions during the Lunar New Year holiday and rattled global markets.
Apple s shares rose about 86% in 2019, outperforming a 29% rise in the S&P 500 index. The stock closed down nearly 3% at $308.95 on Monday as coronavirus fears dragged down high-flying U.S. chip and technology stocks.
Cupertino, California-based Apple, which raked in more than $142 billion in iPhone sales in fiscal 2019, has introduced lower priced smartphone variants to woo budget conscious shoppers and check declining sales of its biggest product category.
Last October, Nikkei reported that Apple asked its suppliers to increase production of iPhone 11 models by up to 8 million units, or about 10%, hinting that demand for the recently launched versions of its flagship phone was picking up.

Investors are keeping an eye out for a slew of earnings due this week including from Apple Inc . on Tuesday while also monitoring the impact of the deadly coronavirus. Even as containment efforts intensify, the likelihood of the virus disrupting global businesses and the world’s second-largest economy appears to be growing.
“Risk appetite is unlikely to improve until we start getting news that the virus is under control,” DBS Group Holdings Ltd. strategists Philip Wee and Eugene Leow wrote in a note. “For now, the lack of positive news flow is likely to keep investors on the defensive.”
The outbreak shattered a calm in markets that hadn’t seen a 1% up-or-down move in the S&P 500 since early October. The latest surge in demand for havens also sent bond yields tumbling, with the global supply of notes with negative rates surpassing $13 trillion, to the highest since November.

Investing.com -- Apple  reports quarterly results amidst expectations for record service revenue. China s death toll from the coronavirus rises but so does the recovery rate. The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day policy meeting against a backdrop of data on durable goods and consumer confidence, while the ECB flagged the increasing strains of low interest rates on the profitability of eurozone banks. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 28th January.
1. Mixed news on the coronavirus
The death toll from the novel coronavirus rose to 106, according to Chinese government data, while the number of confirmed cases rose to 4,515. Chinese authorities also reported 60 cases where patients had recovered, strengthening impressions that the virus may not be as lethal as the SARS virus was 17 years ago.
Restrictions on public life in China continue to point to a dip in economic activity, however. Hong Kong suspended ferry and rail services with the mainland, while Shanghai municipal authorities instructed factories to stay shut until Feb. 8. Other manufacturing centers have also taken similar measures.
The Chinese yuan touched a new low against the dollar earlier in the day but losses were more moderate than on Monday.

2. Apple s first earnings since launching streaming service
Apple  is set to report another record quarter for revenue from its growing services division when it posts its quarterly earnings after the closing bell, helped by the launch of its Apple TV streaming service in November.
Also of note will be Apple’s guidance on the smartphone market, which it has previously said will surge this year due to upgrades to 5G-supportive devices.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the first quarter of Apple’s 2020 fiscal year to show earnings per share up 9% on the year at $4.54, on a 4.5% rise in revenue to $88.38 billion.
Services revenue – the key to Apple’s long-term outlook, given the increasing saturation of the global smartphone market, rose 17% in the 2019 fiscal year.
3. Stocks set to bounce after Monday horror show

U.S. stock markets are set to bounce at the open after their worst day in months on Monday. By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were up 62 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures were up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.5%.
After the bell on Monday, Whirlpool  stock and Juniper Networks  stock had both fallen in response to their respective quarterly updates.

In Europe, the recovery was a more mixed affair, with the German DAX and Dutch AEX both falling under the weight of disappointing updates from index heavyweights SAP   and Koninklijke Philips . The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 0.1%, while the U.K. FTSE rebounded a modest 0.1%.
4. Fed meeting starts; durable goods, consumer confidence data due
The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day policy meeting against a backdrop of concerns for the world economy due to China’s measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Analysts expect the central bank to keep its official interest rates unchanged, despite fresh criticism last week from President Donald Trump.

The day’s economic data include the release of monthly durable goods orders at 8:30 AM ET and the Conference Board’s consumer confidence survey at 10 AM ET. There will also be regional business surveys from the Dallas and Richmond Feds.
5. ECB fails six banks in its annual capital review
The European Central Bank said that six banks fell short of their capital requirements in its latest supervisory review. That’s up from one a year ago.
The ECB also said it was concerned by the low profitability of many of the banks it monitored. Low interest rates, high operating costs and limited flexibility in cutting jobs mean that many banks are earning below their cost of capital, which limits their ability to issue fresh equity should they need to."

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to edge higher Tuesday, rebounding after Monday’s sharp losses as the earnings season kicks into top gear. This is despite continued concerns over the deadly coronavirus in China.

At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 11 points, or 0.3%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 49 points, or 0.6%, higher, while theDow Jones 30 Futures contract rose 75 points, or 0.3%.

The death toll from the new strain of coronavirus climbed overnight to 106, while the number of total confirmed cases in China surged to 4,515, the country’s National Health Commission said. All but six of those to die were in Wuhan, the city where the disease was first noticed. 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general, expressed confidence in the Chinese authorities dealing with the outbreak, adding that he didn’t advocate the evacuation of foreign nationals from China.
Additionally, China’s central bank said Tuesday that it will inject funds to keep banking system liquidity at a reasonably ample level. In a statement, it also said the holiday for the interbank markets would be extended to Monday.

On Monday, theS&P 500 had ended down 1.6%, or 51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.6%, more than 450 points. These were the biggest falls for these two indexes since October. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.9%, or 175 points, its biggest drop since August. 
On Wall Street, Apple  will be in focus after it reports earnings after the bell, with many eager to see whether its latest slate of phones has revived sales. The stock has more than doubled over the last 12 months.

Additionally, three more Dow components will issue results ahead of trading - 3M  missed expectations with its earnings release, posting EPS of $1.95 compared with $2.10 expected, while revenues of $8.12 billion were largely as expected. United Technologies  reported EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $19.55 billion, ahead of expectations of EPS of $1.84 on revenue of $19.4 billion.   Pfizer    disappointed with its earnings release, with EPS of $0.55, below forecasts for $0.58. Revenues were largely as expected at $12.69 billion

Whirlpool s  fourth-quarter results, released after the close Monday, came in ahead of expectations while its outlook for 2020 also impressed. 

Boeing  will also be in the spotlight after CNBC reported the company has managed to obtain more financing than it was originally seeking, shoring up its balance sheet amid the lengthy grounding of its 737 MAX airline series.

Economic data releases will also be studied carefully at the start of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting. Durable goods orders are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are expected to have risen 0.3% last month, while at 10 AM ET, the January consumer confidence index is expected to come in at 128, up from 126.5 in December.

Losses have continued in the oil complex, although not to the same dramatic extent as Monday.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Apple Inc  posts quarterly results on Tuesday, investors will be looking for fresh evidence the iPhone maker should be treated as a producer of high-margin, subscription services after its stock market value touched $1.4 trillion and its earnings multiple trades at decade highs.
The Cupertino, California corporation s stock has doubled over the past year, even as iPhone sales contract along with the rest of the global smartphone market. Fueling its stellar run has been Chief Executive Tim Cook s push to turn Apple s loyal client base into a source of steady services revenue, including streaming video and a credit card launched last year with Goldman Sachs .
Also supporting Apple s stock is excitement around an eventual pickup in iPhone demand with the rollout of 5G wireless technology, and low interest rates that have broadly helped Wall Street.
Shares of Apple fell 2.9% on Monday from record highs as fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China hit Wall Street. Analysts on Apple s quarterly earnings call after the bell on Tuesday will listen for comments concerning the impact on its manufacturing operations in China.Apple s market capitalization briefly exceeded $1.4 trillion last Wednesday for the first time, but it has yet to end a session at that level. Some investors worry that Apple s rally, and surging earnings multiple, may have become overextended.
""The run-up in the stock is a concern, and I wouldn t be surprised if we see a bit of a pullback in the near future,"" said People s United Advisors chief equity strategist John Conlon, who added that Apple s services business has become his main reason for owning stock.
Following its recent rally, Apple s stock is trading at the equivalent of 23 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2010, according to Refinitiv. Apple s average PE over the past decade was about 14, lagging other high-growth companies with recurring revenue and reflecting its singular dependence on iPhones sales and reliance on persuading consumers to upgrade their phones year after year. 
Salesforce.com  and Netflix , which rely on recurring revenue, are trading at over 55 times expected earnings. Tech hardware sellers Intel  and Cisco Systems  are at about 14 times expected earnings.
Apple is on track to reach a goal to double its 2016 services revenue to $48.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 as it focuses on selling high-margin subscriptions to its user base. Many investors envision an increasingly rosy future for its earnings, a trend reflected in its soaring earnings multiple.
Adding to existing services including cloud storage, the App Store and music, Apple last year launched an ambitious video streaming service, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service.
Apple has also increased the emphasis on its AppleCare, its extended warranty program. For example, the iPhone s ""settings"" now includes reminders encouraging people to buy or renew their AppleCare plans.
In the September quarter, Apple said its services revenue hit $12.51 billion, topping analysts expectations of $12.15 billion. Services accounted for 20% of total revenue in that quarter, up from 17% in the same quarter the year before.
Apple also gave cost of sales data showing gross margins for its services segment rose to 64% from a 61% a year earlier. That is far more generous than Apple s overall gross margin of around 38% in recent years.
Still, for a business segment getting the most attention from Wall Street, Apple provides limited details. Apple s quarterly reports break out sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads, but a breakdown of results from products falling within the services category so far has not been released.
Apple s recent strong stock performance has been perpetuated by fund managers buying its shares in order to avoid underperforming their benchmarks, a trend that could reverse when the recent rally ends, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a client note last week.
For the fiscal first quarter, which ended in December, analysts on average expect services revenue to jump 19.7% to $13.0 billion, according to Refinitiv."

LONDON (Reuters) - European markets stabilized on Tuesday after worries about the economic fallout of China s spreading coronavirus set off the worst global rout in months.
A flat STOXX 600 (EU) and higher Wall Street futures (N) indicated some relief after Monday s biggest drop in world stocks since October.
Chinese markets are closed all week, but a 0.5% overnight drop in Tokyo s Nikkei was more modest than Monday s thumping. Many of Asia s other markets that were open had rallied.
Even so, the mood remained jittery. The death toll from the virus topped 100 overnight and Germany confirmed its first case. A number of governments and multinational companies were curbing travel.
Japan s safe-haven yen began to climb again after a pause overnight. China s yuan dropped toward three-week lows and the euro fell to almost a three-year trough against the Swiss franc. [/FRX]
Oil prices were wobbling after a three-month low of $58.50 a barrel drew talk of an OPEC output cut. In bond markets the demand for safety pushed U.S Treasury yields under 1.60% for the first time since October. [O/R]
""We saw a bit of a bounce back overnight in the most high- volume liquid assets like the S&P 500 futures, but it s hard to find anything to hang your hat on because we still need to assess the risks,"" said Saxo Bank s head of FX strategy, John Hardy. 
China has taken the precaution of extending its Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 2 nationally and to Feb. 9 for Shanghai. Its largest steelmaking city, Tangshan, suspended all public transit in an effort to contain the virus.
Chinese President Xi Jinping also met with the chief of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Beijing, and discussed ways to combat the outbreak, including ""possible alternatives"" to evacuations, a WHO spokesman said.
""The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide,"" state television quoted Xi as saying. 
WILD CARD
MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.8%. Japan s Nikkei, which was down nearly 1% at one point, closed 0.5% lower. Australian shares ended 1.3% down and South Korea s Kospi index fell 3%. 
The iShares China Large-Cap ETF sank 4% on Monday. It is down about 10% since Jan. 17, when worries began to grow about the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
""The wild card is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is,"" Citi economists wrote in a note. ""The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained."" 
Moreover, as companies report potential business disruptions and governments advise against unnecessary travel to and within China, analysts are trying to compute how much the disruption could damage growth.
APPLE EYED
Apple  is due to report results later. Its plan to ramp up iPhone production by 10% in the first half of the year will be the top question as the coronavirus spreads across major markets like China.
""... The interesting part will be how much the virus and the contamination efforts of the Chinese government will hamper supply chains and growth, and that is really hard to grasp in the short term,"" said Christian Lenk, an interest rates strategist at DZ Bank.
Market gauges of long-term inflation expectations fell to their lowest in a month and a half in the euro zone at 1.2640%.
The yield on the benchmark German Bund was flat at -0.38%, not far from the three-month low -0.391% it fell to on Monday. Yields across other European markets, including Italy and Spain, were also broadly stable.
In the United States, a two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts later. The market consensus is that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75%, but attention will be on what it thinks about the virus effects.
Chinese authorities may also have more limited room to stimulate the economy than it had during the 2002-03 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, another reason investors were jittery. 
Treasury 10-year note yields were off lows after falling as low as 1.598%, the lowest since Oct. 10. Fed fund futures <0#FF:> have rallied in recent days as investors priced in more risk of a rate cut later this year. Futures now imply around 35 basis points of easing by year-end. 
JPMorgan  said it has not yet altered its forex forecasts, though it was taking profits on ""bullish"" EUR/USD positions and remains ""considerably long"" on Swiss francs, which benefit from safe-haven demand. 
Short build-up in the Aussie was another risk hedge. The currency was last flat at $0.6760 after two days of losses. The euro was up at $1.1022.
In commodities, Brent crude was off 12 cents a barrel at $59.20. U.S. crude fell 2 cents to $53.12. Brent is now down 18% from a spike caused by the U.S. killing of Iran s top military commander at the start of the year. [O/R]
Spot gold weaker at $1,579.28 an ounce, after climbing to its highest since 2013 on Monday.

""(Gold) could reach $1,600, but would be more around the $1,570-$1,590 levels as we need to get more information,"" said John Sharma, an economist at National Australia Bank (NAB). ""There are a lot of unknown variables around the virus."" "

Handset shipments for Shenzhen-based Huawei jumped 35.5% to 142 million in 2019, from 104.8 million a year earlier, according to estimates from market research firm Canalys.
Shipments for Apple s iPhones decreased about 21% year-on-year to 27.5 million. This comes as the domestic market for smartphones shrank 15% annually, according to the report released on Tuesday.
Growth in smartphone sales stagnated in 2018 and 2019 as consumers postponed purchases, opting to wait for companies to release more 5G-enabled models. Huawei has already released four of these in China, while  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) has released two.
Other Chinese Android makers are racing to release 5G phones in the hope that consumers will upgrade their handsets as China rolls out its 5G network to most big cities this year.
Xiaomi s full-year shipments fell about 21% in 2019. Rivals Oppo and Vivo dropped 17% and 19%, respectively, over the same time period.
Huawei remains at the center of U.S.-China tensions. Last year, Washington imposed restrictions on the handset maker that barred American suppliers from selling goods and services to it, citing national security concerns. Huawei has denied these charges.
But the restrictions have had little impact on its ability to sell phones domestically. However, losing access to Google s services had affected the company s business overseas.
The sanctions in fact helped boost Huawei s sales in China on the back of patriotic consumer purchases. The company s aggressive marketing has helped as well.
Huawei s fortunes picked up as iPhone sales lagged in 2017 and 2018, following a peak in the previous years. Last year, Apple offered discounts on iPhones to boost sales, a move that Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook later said was successful.
Canalys estimates iPhone sales fell 12% in the quarter ended Dec. 31. In the preceding quarter, sales had fallen 28%.
However, this year could be a better one for Apple, with the company expected to launch its first 5G-enabled iPhone."

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose over 1% on Tuesday as a surge in Apple and other technology stocks helped the benchmark index recover from its worst selloff in about four months that was sparked by concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.
Markets across the world stabilized as the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was confident in China s ability to contain the virus outbreak, which has killed 106 people in the country, prompted businesses to close operations and curbed travel.
President Xi Jinping later said China was sure of defeating a ""devil"" coronavirus.
""Investors are still trying to assess the possible impact of the coronavirus and they probably feel that yesterday s decline was a bit overdone,"" said Daniel Grosvenor, director of equity strategy at Oxford Economics.
""Our base case is that economic impact is likely to be relatively short-lived, but there is scope for volatility in the near-term.""
The earnings season gathered pace, with Apple Inc  set to report fourth-quarter results after markets close. Its shares rose 2.4% after a 3% drop on Monday amid a broader market selloff.
Investors will keep a close watch on Apple s earnings amid concerns of a disruption in iPhone production as the coronavirus spreads across major markets such as China.
The S&P technology index (SPLRCT), which led Monday s selloff, rose 1.8%, while financial stocks (SPSY) gained 1.5% as big banks rebounded.
Bolstering the recovery, data showed U.S. consumer confidence surged to a five-month high in January.
At 12:48 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.85% to 28,777.77.
The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1.11% at 3,279.53 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 1.40% at 9,267.69.
Earnings are now expected to show a decline of 0.4% for the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 104 companies that have reported so far, 68.3% have topped expectations, lagging the average rate of 74% from the past four quarters.
Results were mixed on Tuesday, with U.S. industrial giant 3M Co  sliding 5.5% after it forecast 2020 profit below expectations as weak demand from China dents overall growth.
 Pfizer  Inc  dropped 4.4% after the drugmaker reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would no longer rely on share repurchases to help drive growth.
Shares in Xerox Holdings Corp  jumped 5.9% after the company s profit beat analysts  estimates as it kept a tight lid on costs.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P rallied Tuesday, shrugging off mostly weaker corporate earnings and lingering fears over the new coronavirus as the U.S. stepped up measures to curb a potential outbreak.
The S&P 500 jumped 1.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.37% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.82%.
As the busiest week of earnings continues to unfold, traders had to contend with a slew of mostly bearish quarterly reports.
3M  slipped about 6% after the industrial giant reported quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street estimates. United Technologies , however, beat quarterly estimates on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares about 2% higher.
  Pfizer   , meanwhile, fell 4% after its missed quarterly earnings estimates, driven partly by the loss of exclusivity for its pain drug Lyrica.

The rebound in the broader market, following a rout a day earlier, comes against lingering concerns about the coronavirus as the death toll in China continues to rise.

China s death toll from the coronavirus rose to 103 and it reported that the number of people infected with the virus jumped 60% overnight.  

The virus has mostly been isolated to China, with a handful of cases reported elsewhere, but the U.S. has stepped up preventative measures.
Health Secretary Alex Azar warned that the disease potentially represents a ""very serious public health threat,” and confirmed that the Trump administration is expanding screening for the virus from five to 20 U.S. airports.
Casino stocks, which are among the worst hit by the outbreak of virus in China, clawed back some of their recent losses, with Wynn ,   Las Vegas Sands    and Melco Resorts & Entertainment  trading above the flatline.

(Reuters) - Buckle up. Tesla s quarterly report could be another wild ride for investors.
The electric carmaker s stock has more than doubled since Tesla s previous quarterly report on October 23, when it posted a surprise profit that was viewed as a milestone for the company.
Still, a Reuters analysis of Tesla s and other luxury carmakers  operating profit per vehicle - a metric closely watched by auto executives - shows Tesla  still has a long way to go before reaching the steady profits of rivals  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
(For a graphic comparing vehicles  profitability, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TESLA-RESULTS/0H001R87WBMF/index.html)
At an average of roughly $17,750 per vehicle, operating profit at luxury carmaker Porsche, for example, has been stable over the past four years. Mercedes  and BMW s profit per vehicle have been closer to $3,000.
At Tesla, on the other hand, operating results fluctuated between a loss of nearly $20,500 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2017 and a profit of nearly $5,000 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2018.
Calculating profits per vehicle allows for better comparison across the auto industry. Reuters selected Porsche, BMW and Mercedes because their cars compete in similar price segments and for a like-minded customer base.
Tesla s rally in recent months has been fueled by its unexpected third-quarter profit, a production ramp-up at its new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries. Tesla s stock was up 1% on Tuesday.
While analysts on average expect Tesla to report another profitable quarter, it would be only the fifth such quarter since 2010. For the December quarter, analysts on average expect Tesla to post revenue down 2.9% to $7.02 billion and adjusted net income of $305 million, or $1.72 per share.
Options traders expect more volatility after Tesla releases its fourth-quarter results late on Wednesday.
As of Tuesday, Tesla options implied an 11% swing for the shares in either direction by Friday. Over the last eight quarters, the stock moved 9.5% on average after Tesla reported results, according to options analytics company Trade Alert.
Porsche last year released its first fully-electric sports car, while Mercedes and BMW have released their own electric vehicle versions. General Motors  and Ford Motor  are gearing up to launch their own electric vehicles.
While the German carmakers still largely rely on combustion engine-powered cars and are struggling to persuade customers to pay a premium for electric vehicles, they have a century of manufacturing and a well-developed global sales network behind them.
As Musk s nears the first tranche of a record pay package that depends in part on increasing Tesla s market capitalization, the carmaker s stock remains among the most divisive on Wall Street.
While Tesla’s recent progress has cheered supporters, many investors remain skeptical of the company’s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow. As well as repeatedly missing targets in recent years, Musk’s mercurial behavior has come under scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders.
Tesla s market capitalization must be sustained at or above $100 billion for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of a $346-million tranche of options that are the first part of Musk s record-breaking pay package.

In the past 30 days, short bets against Tesla have decreased by almost $660 million to $14 billion, eclipsing the $12.9 billion worth of short positions against much-larger Apple  and making Tesla the most shorted stock on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm."

Investing.com –  The Dow rallied sharply Tuesday, as the rout a day earlier attracted bargain buying across stocks, even as the bulk of corporate earnings failed to live up to Wall Street expectations.

The S&P 500 rose 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%.

Bargain-hunting investors piled into beaten-down sectors like tech and travel stocks.

American Airlines  and Delta Air Lines  both ended in a day the green. But United Airlines  proved an expectation to the rally after announcing that it was cutting some flights from the U.S. to mainland China, citing a ""significant decline in demand as the (coronavirus) continues to spread.""

The death toll from the coronavirus in China rose to 106, with 4,600 affected globally, according to media reports.  
Tech also saw some reprieve, led by a rebound in semiconductor stocks with some on Wall Street suggesting the outbreak may pose a benefit to U.S.-based chip firms.

Any disruption to memory output in China on the back of a faster spread of the virus could ""be positive for memory suppliers outside of China such as Micron ,   Western Digital    and others,"" said Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index ended the day more than 2% higher.  

Apple  also supported the rally in the broader market, rising nearly 3% ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report due after the closing bell.  
A wave of mostly bearish earnings, meanwhile, had little impact on sentiment.
3M  slipped about 6% after the industrial giant reported quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street estimates. United Technologies , however, beat quarterly estimates on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares about 1% higher.

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com - Apple  reported earnings that topped analyst expectations as a new slate of phones led to a revival in iPhone sales during the fiscal first quarter.
Shares rose a little more than 1% after hours.

The company reported earnings per share of $4.99 on revenue of $91.82 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $4.54 on revenue of $88.38 billion.
That was in comparison with EPS of $4.18 on revenue of $84.31 billion in the same quarter a year before. Apple had announced EPS of $3.03 on revenue of $64.04 billion in the prior quarter.
The earnings beat comes as iPhone sales returned to growth, while services grew slower than expected in the quarter.   
IPhone revenue rose 7.6% to $55.96 billion from a year earlier, topping estimates of $51.2 billion.
“We are thrilled to report Apple’s highest quarterly revenue ever, fueled by strong demand for our iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, and all-time records for services and wearables,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “During the holiday quarter our active installed base of devices grew in each of our geographic segments and has now reached over 1.5 billion. We see this as a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers — and a great driver of our growth across the board.”
Revenue for the company’s fast-growing services segment, which includes Apple  Music, Apple Pay and iCloud storage – rose 17% to $12.7 billion from a year earlier, compared with estimates of $12.8 billion.
""With growth for iPhones reviving and Apple’s services business showing strong expansion, investors have become confident about the company’s prospects. For the first time since 2011, shares of the iPhone maker have been trading at a higher price-earnings ratio than the S&P 500,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. 
Apple’s wearables, home and accessories category - previously called other products - grew revenue 37% to $10 billion from the year-ago period, above estimates of $9.7 billion.
Revenue for the iPad grew 17% and revenue for the Mac grew 9%.
Looking ahead, the company guided fiscal second-quarter revenue in the range of $64 billion and $67 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $58.83 billion.
Gross margin was guided within a range of 38% to 39% compared with estimates of 38.2%. 
""Apple’s push to expand its sales from services is clearly succeeding, while growth from iPhones is coming back,"" Anwar said. ""This powerful combination justifies the stock’s current valuation and its future growth potential. Any post earnings weakness, in our view, should be taken as a buying opportunity.""  

Apple is up 8.19% from the beginning of the year, still down 1.74% from its 52-week high of $323.32 set on January 24."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, powered by a rise in iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones.
But even though Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers on its platform by the end of calendar 2020, the company s closely watched services business, which includes its new Apple TV+ streaming offering, missed Wall Street s targets. Apple s total number of installed devices grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year.
Apple gave a revenue forecast for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. But Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company was using a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China, where many of Apple s suppliers are based. Cook said executives plan to discuss more details of how the virus will affect Apple s supply chain on the company s conference call with investors.
Apple shares rose 2.7% to $326.15 in after-hours trading after the results were announced.
Apple posted $91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year.
Apple’s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. The company also made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs  and subscription gaming and television services last year.
Apple reported services revenue of $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before. Many investors think that services revenue eventually will boost Apple’s gross margins, which were 38.35% in the December quarter compared with estimates of 38.06%.
The shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales, which can be inconsistent because they are large purchases that consumers make only every few years. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier.
Apple s Cook told Reuters the company expects surpass its previously stated goal of 500 million subscribers for 2020 during the current quarter ended in March, ahead of schedule. Cook said Apple is establishing a new goal of 600 million subscribers by the end of the calendar year.
""We re really proud of 100 million (user) growth in the installed base. That s huge. And that s a testament to the new customers we brought in, the switchers,"" Cook told Reuters.
Cook said the company s Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a ""rousing success"" and that it is ""very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven t bought a new device.""
Solid iPhone sales of $55.96 billion compared with analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion snapped a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple’s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company s forecast, calling the devices ""the strongest iPhone lineup we ve ever had.""
But Apple’s wearables segment – which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch – hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients that sales of AirPods alone – a metric Apple does not disclose – may have reached $3.5 billion to $4 billion in the December quarter, a rise of 150% from the year before.
Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for each.
""We re working on both of those very hard,"" Cook told Reuters."

By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the markets this week.

1. Apple’s Done, Here Comes Tesla

Apple  came through for investors with its results after the bell today, but there will be little time to dwell on numbers before another huge batch of big-name earnings reports drops.
And the hype will be all around Tesla , a stock that’s up more than 70% in the last three months and now sporting a market cap of more than $100 billin.

Tesla reports after market close Wednesday, with analysts expecting a fourth-quarter profit of $1.64 per share on sales of nearly $7 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.

Oppenheimer, which has an outperform rating on the stock, said ahead of the results that the critical (long term) variables for the stock are whether the company can scale to 1 million vehicle deliveries, achieve double-digit margins at that level and seize a time-to-market advantage in autonomous vehicles.

As of Tuesday, Tesla options implied an 11% swing for the shares in either direction by Friday. Over the last eight quarters, the stock moved 9.5% on average after Tesla  reported results, according to options analytics company Trade Alert.

Joining Tesla in reporting postmarket are two tech giants, Dow components Microsoft  and Facebook .

Facebook is expected to have earned $2.52 per share in its latest quarter on revenue of nearly $21 billion.
Stifel reiterated its buy on Facebook on Monday and bumped up its price target to $250 from $240.

Analysts are looking for Microsoft to post earnings of $1.32 per share, with revenue of about $35.7 billion. Shares are up nearly 15% in the last three months.
Before the bell the Dow deluge continues, with component Boeing  probably garnering the most interest. It’s been in the headlines constantly with the grounding of its 737 Max jetliner after two fatal crashes and its high share price has big impact on the price-weighted blue-chip index.

Boeing is forecast to report an adjusted profit of 60 cents per share on revenue of about $21.7 billion.
Maybe even more important than the numbers, though, will be if the aerospace giant provides any more visibility on when the 737 Max could return to service. The company most recently said it expects regulatory approval sometime in the middle of this year.

Boeing will be joined by more Dow components when McDonald’s  and   Dow Chemical    also weigh in ahead of trading.

  General Electric    and AT&T  are also on the calendar.
2. Fed Looks to Be on Hold, but Watch for Hints on Months From Now

It’s not often a Federal Reserve interest rate decision isn’t the big news of the day, but while tomorrow’s announcement will still be important, it’s also considered a foregone conclusion.

The Federal Open Market Committee will release its statement on the fed funds rate at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT).

The press conference with Fed chief Jerome Powell will follow at 2:30 PM ET.

There is an 89% chance that the FOMC keeps rates at 1.5% to 1.75%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Investors will be looking for anything in the statement or Powell’s remarks that looks to take additional easing off the table for the rest of the year.
And don’t forget the specter of politics still hovers over Fed decisions.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday renewed his call for the Fed to lower interest rates, saying it would allow the United States to pay off debt.
“The Fed should get smart & lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard. We would then focus on paying off & refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!” Trump wrote in a tweet.
3. Home Sales, Oil Inventories Also on Tap

Among the last-minute data the Fed will get to consider before its decision will be the goods trade balance, which comes at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect it to have widened in December to $68.75 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 10:00 AM ET, the National Association of Realtors issues its numbers on December pending home sales.

Pending home sales are seen rising 0.5% for the month, below November’s 1.2% rise.
For the energy traders, the Energy Information Administration reports weekly oil inventory numbers at 10:30 AM ET.

Oil stockpiles are expected to have dropped by 482,000 last week, although the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise draw of 4.3 million today in its measure."
129,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/foxconn-says-plans-in-place-to-meet-production-obligations-after-virus-outbreak-2070046,2020-01-29,Foxconn says plans in place to meet production obligations after virus outbreak By Reuters,"TAIPEI - Apple Inc  supplier Foxconn said it could continue to meet all manufacturing obligations in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak in China even as the iPhone maker flagged uncertainty created by the disease.
""We do not comment on our specific production practices, but we can confirm that we have measures in place to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations,"" Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a statement on Tuesday.
A new coronavirus has killed 132 in China and affected nearly 6,000 people, with several other countries reporting cases as well.
China extended the Lunar New year Holiday by three days to Feb. 2 to contain spread of the virus.
Foxconn, which has a big facility in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, said its plants in China were following holiday schedules and would continue to do so until all businesses have resumed standard operating hours.
The outbreak has led countries including the United States to advise against all but necessary travel to China, forced food chains such as Starbucks  to close stores and airlines to cancel flights.
Apple, which reported holiday quarter sales and profit above Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, offered a wider-than-normal earnings outlook for the March quarter because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus.
""The situation is emerging, and we re still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.
Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, but has alternatives, Cook said.
After the Lunar New Year holiday, factories outside the Wuhan area will not reopen until Feb. 10, Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast."
130,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--europe-to-see-limited-gains-ahead-of-fed-decision-2070132,2020-01-29,Stocks - Europe to See Limited Gains Ahead of Fed Decision By Investing.com,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge higher at the open Wednesday, helped by the strong close on Wall Street overnight. However, gains are likely to be limited as worries over the spread of the deadly coronavirus in China remain. 

At 02:10 ET (0710 GMT), the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. traded 15 points, or 0.2% higher. France s CAC 40 futures were up 5 points, or 0.1%, while the DAX futures in Germany fell 18 points, or 0.1%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, gained 2 points, or 0.1%. That followed modest upside surprise from German consumer confidence numbers and the strongest monthly growth in U.K. house prices since November 2018, according to the lender Nationwide.

Overnight the death toll from the outbreak reached 132 people, with close to 6,000 infected. Chinese authorities have closed transport systems in and out of Wuhan, where the virus was first noticed, and at least 10 other cities, effectively quarantining millions of people. 
British Airways decided early on Wednesday to suspend all flights to China, Reuters reported. CNBC had reported on Tuesday that the White House had also considered imposing a ban on U.S. flights to China.

There are at least 47 cases confirmed in 16 other countries, including in Thailand, France, the U.S. and Australia.
“So far, the spreading outside of China still seems limited and no deaths have been reported outside of China,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. “We expect the epidemic to be particularly hard on the service sector in China, but retail sales could also suffer, which could hurt imports.”

Overnight the S&P 500 rose 1%, the Nasdaq 1.4% and the DJIA gained 0.7%, rebounding from the worst daily decline in four months on Monday, as investors turned their attention to earnings season and improving economic data.
The Conference Board measure of consumer confidence rose to 131.6 in January s preliminary report, up from a revised 128.2 in December. This is the best reading since August and is not far from the all-time high of 137.9 seen in October 2018. 

“The fact that the report has come in so strong shouldn t be too much of a surprise given the U.S. has the lowest unemployment rate since the late 1960s, record high home and equity prices and the lowest national gasoline prices since last March,” said ING s James Knightley in a research note. “As such, households have job security, their balance sheets are in a great position and they perhaps have a bit more cash in their pocket after filling up at the gas station.”
While earnings were mixed, with 3M  and   Pfizer    dropping sharply after weaker than expected quarterly results, Apple  boosted the major indexes by closing higher amid expectations its fourth quarter release would impress. And after the market close the tech giant duly delivered, reporting better-than-expected profits for the fourth quarter and forecast revenue in the current quarter above Wall Street expectations.

The earnings season continues Wednesday, with most eyes on Facebook . The  online social media and social networking service is expected to post earnings growth of 6.2%. That said, Goldman Sachs  will also be in the spotlight as the banking giant offers up its first-ever investor day. In Europe,   Novartis    is likely to drop back after reporting a slight miss to its fourth quarter numbers, although it did predict 2020 growty, while   Banco Santander    posted a 35% increase in fourth-quarter net profit, boosted by a solid underlying performance in its main market Brazil.

The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy setting meeting Wednesday, and will announce its decision in a policy statement at 14:00 ET (1900 GMT), with the chairman holding a press conference 30 minutes later.
The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates steady following December forecasts that showed no change in 2020, and is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold."

By 0809 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.1%, continuing a recovery from a selloff earlier this week.
Spain s IBEX (IBEX) outperformed regional bourses, lifted by a 2% rise in Santander . The lender posted a higher quarterly net profit, boosted by a solid underlying performance in its main market Brazil and capital gains.
The banks index (SX7P) climbed 0.5%, the most among the main European subsectors."

(Bloomberg) -- Apple’s first-quarter results spurred optimism among analysts that demand for the tech giant’s iPhones will endure, especially as the company is said to be preparing to launch a new low-cost model and a 5G-enabled device later this year.
Analysts were particularly positive on growth in China, as well as the outlook for the second quarter, even as the performance of the services division disappointed. Analysts at Cowen also cautioned of the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand in the all-important Asian region.
The shares rose 2.2% in the U.S. pre-market and are poised to open at a record high. Apple  stock has gained this year as analysts have become increasingly positive on the potential boost from 5G iPhone upgrades.
RBC, Robert Muller
(Outperform, price target raised to $358 from $330)
“A lot to like,” with growth in China following four quarters of year-on-year declines. While service revenue was slightly below consensus, it still grew at an “impressive” 17% rate.
Notes 75% of Watch purchases were new customers, which should further lock customers in the ecosystem and thus be positive for future iPhone sales.
Report more than justified renewed optimism surrounding the core iPhone business with results “well ahead” of expectations ahead of the start of a potential 5G super cycle.
 Morgan Stanley  , Katy Huberty
(Overweight, price target $368)
Second-quarter gross profit guidance is 5.5% above consensus, the biggest delta since the March 2011 quarter, and the fourth quarter in a row of better gross profit guidance.
Strong iPhone demand to continue as Apple expands price points with a lower-priced iPhone launching in March and 5G in September.
Services slowdown is not a structural concern, and likely explained by year-on-year declines in the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and iCloud services.
Wedbush, Dan Ives
(Outperform, price target $400)
A “blow out print” that will “put more high octane fuel in the bull thesis,” as iPhone 11 strength continues both domestically and internationally, with China a “clear star of the show.”
Main highlight is second-quarter guidance of $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion versus consensus $62.5 billion, amid pent-up demand within the installed iPhone base.
“A major feather in the cap for the bulls that should drive the stock higher over the coming weeks and months.”
Cowen, Krish Sankar
(Outperform, price target raised to $370 from $350)
IPhone growth was driven by the model 11 product cycle and the trade-in and financing programs that are now available in more regions, while the 5G cycle could drive 2020/21 units back above 200 million.
Greatest near-term risk is the impact of the coronavirus on daily life in China. App store activity will be a key metric to monitor in coming months."
133,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tim-cook-says-apple-working-to-mitigate-impact-of-china-coronavirus-2070240,2020-01-29,Tim Cook Says Apple Working to Mitigate Impact of China Coronavirus By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc . issued a wider-than-usual sales forecast to reflect what Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called “uncertainty” caused by a virus outbreak that’s cutting retail traffic, shutting stores and prompting the company to limit employee travel in China, one of its most important markets.
The company is also taking steps to make up for production shortages, particularly in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus originated and home to some of the company’s suppliers, Cook said on a conference call discussing recent results. Sales in the current period will be $63 billion to $67 billion. While that’s higher than analysts predicted, it’s also a wider range than the company tends to forecast.
“We do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of the suppliers there are alternate sources and we’re obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss,” Cook said. “We factored our best thinking in the guidance that we provided you. With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time.”
The CEO has led Apple to a remarkable comeback in the past year, reviving iPhone sales, dodging the worst of a U.S.-China trade war and creating a new gadget hit with AirPods. The company’s holiday-quarter revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, with double-digit percentage sales growth from iPhones, wearables and services in mainland China.

However, the deadly, spreading coronavirus is a new challenge for the company, which has most of its hardware made in China. Discussion of the virus was one of the few dour notes during an otherwise upbeat earnings call with analysts on Tuesday. Authorities have placed strict limits on travel, and airlines are suspending flights to China, taking a toll on businesses across the region. Almost 6,000 people have been infected in mainland China, and at least 132 have died.
“For now, supply chains for smartphones seem OK, but that can change in a flash,” said Neil Mawston, executive director of the global wireless practice at Strategy Analytics. “If any lockdown spreads and extends well into February or even March, then supply chains could start to get tight.”

Smartphone factories typically hold two to eight weeks of component or device inventory, so there will be some buffer, at least in the short-term, he added.
After an extended Chinese Lunar New Year Holiday, Cook said factories are reopening on Feb. 10, rather than at the end of January. Apple has tried to account for this “delayed start up” through its wider sales forecast, the CEO said. On Wednesday, main iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group confirmed all of its facilities will resume full-scale production starting Feb. 10.
Beyond potential production disruptions, the outbreak threatens to dampen sales in its largest market outside of the U.S. just as iPhone shipments globally are bouncing back. Apple has closed one retail store in China and some that are still open have reduced operating hours. The company is “deep cleaning” stores and has begun checking employees’ temperatures, Cook said. Last week, it also began limiting employee travel in affected areas to business-critical situations, he added.
Revenue from greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, climbed about 3% to $13.6 billion in the holiday quarter. The company ended the year ranked fourth among smartphone makers in the mainland overall, up one notch after reversing a decline in market share, according to research firm Canalys.
“Given the industry is heading full speed to displace 4G with 5G phones, consumers are likely to pause phone replacement to future-proof devices,” said Nicole Peng, Canalys’ vice president of mobility. “The iPhone 11 series is bucking the trend and was the best-selling 4G device in the China market.”"

Investing.com -- It s peak earnings season time, with updates due from a cast of thousands including Tesla, Facebook, McDonald s, Boeing and General Electric. They will all struggle to take attention away from Apple, which is set to open at a new record high after posting blowout earnings for its fiscal first quarter late on Tuesday. The coronavirus death toll has now hit 132, but markets are refusing to panic more than they already have done. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will say later whether he expects any impact on the U.S. economy from the outbreak, but the Fed s policy meeting, which winds up today, isn t expected to result in any change to interest rates. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 29th January. 
1. Coronavirus death toll hits 132, as disruption to business spreads
The number of deaths from the novel coronavirus reached 132, while the number of confirmed cases hit 6,000. While the virus continues to spread, the relatively low apparent mortality rate (SARS killed nearly 10% of those it infected) has allowed a degree of relief to seep through to financial markets.
However, the dip in economic activity in China and further afield continues to take shape. Toyota suspended production in the country, while Starbucks  said it would close 2,000 branches temporarily, joining McDonald’s  and KFC owner Yum! Brands . The U.S. and Japan both started evacuating citizens from the country, while British Airways suspended all flights to China.
China’s transport ministry said overall trips during the current new year holiday season were down 7.2% on the year – a less dramatic decline than earlier figures had suggested.
2. Apple s blowout earnings
Apple  stock is expected to open at a new record high after results for the company’s first quarter of the current fiscal year came in well ahead of expectations. Strong sales of iPhones and its wireless AirPod earbuds, as well as higher revenue from its app store, all contributed.

Revenue rose 9% to $91.82 billion, also assisted by sales of wearables and streaming subscriptions. The company predicted revenue of $63-$67 billion in the current quarter – a wider range than usual due to the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak. Apple has suppliers in Wuhan, where factories have pushed back their scheduled reopening date to Feb. 10, according to reports. In addition, the company faces a hit to retail sales in China, where it has cut store opening hours.

The support to the market from Apple’s earnings after the bell on Tuesday was slightly undermined by weaker-than-expected updates from chipmakers Xilinx  and Advanced Micro Devices .
3. Earnings season hits its peak; with stocks set to open higher.

Earnings season is set to reach its peak, with reports due from – among others -  Facebook, Tesla, General Electric, Mastercard, AT&T, Boeing, McDonald’s, Paypal, Mondelez, ADP , Southern, Anthem, Dow, Marathon, T. Rowe Price, Stanley Black & Decker and Archer Daniels Midland.

For now at least, U.S. stock markets are indicated to open higher, supported by the Apple update and by an easing of fears about the coronavirus impact.

By 6:25 AM ET (1125 GMT), Dow 30 futures were up 62 points or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%.

European stock markets were all solidly higher, with strong updates from   Banco Santander    and pharma giant Novartis leading the way.
4. Fed seen on hold; comments on repo, virus likely to grab headlines

The Federal Reserve will announce the results of its monetary policy meeting at 2 PM ET, to be followed at 2:30 by Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference.
The meeting is not a “live” one, in the sense that there are no expectations for any change interest rates. Instead, the focus is likely to be on what Powell says about the Fed’s balance sheet policy, and whether or when it expects to withdraw repo funding that was initially supposed just to ease the market over the year-end period, but which has since seemingly morphed into an unofficial relaunch of quantitative easing.
Powell’s comments on the impact of the coronavirus on the economic outlook will also be of interest.
5. GOP senators feel the heat
The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump may turn out not to be the foregone conclusion that everyone expected.
The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had told his colleagues he didn’t yet have enough votes to be sure of blocking Democrat demands for witnesses such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton to testify."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global markets showed more signs of stabilisation on Wednesday as investors looked past China s coronavirus outbreak and moved back into shares from safe-haven assets such as the yen and German bonds.
World stocks were flat, pulled down by a 3% fall in Hong Kong, where trading resumed after the Lunar New Year holiday. But they stand just 2% off recent record highs following Tuesday s recovery on Wall Street and gains across Europe.
A pan-European equity index rose 0.5%, extending Tuesday s 0.8% rise. Bank shares gained almost 1%, thanks to upbeat results from Spain s Santander , and Swedbank a day earlier.
Graphic: Market rebound - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1567/1542/markets.png
Equity futures suggest a stronger open for U.S. shares, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 0.5%.
Tuesday s rise was aided by robust earnings from Apple . Of the 104 U.S.companies to report results so far, 68.3% have exceeded expectations, and earnings expectations for the quarter have been upgraded.
""The numbers look pretty solid at the start of the earnings season,"" said Neil Campling, an equity analyst at Mirabaud. ""But there is obviously caution as further news comes out of China regarding the coronavirus.""
The S&P 500 remains 3% below record highs. Investors are looking for earnings from 47 S&P 500 firms on Wednesday, including Facebook , Boeing ,  General Electric  , Microsoft , McDonald’s and AT&T .
Earlier, Chinese equity futures traded in Singapore rebounded from two days of losses to rise 1.79%, the biggest gain in almost seven weeks. Mainland markets remained shut. 
""There appears to be more transparency, communication in terms of the virus, and that makes it easier to start assessing the economic fallout. So the markets have taken some comfort from that,"" said Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank  in Frankfurt.
He was comparing the coronavirus response with Beijing s secretive stance during the 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which enabled it to spread faster and claim more victims. 
FEARS STILL LINGER
Risk aversion has not completely lifted. With the number of coronavirus fatalities https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 now at 132 and 6,000 cases reported worldwide, there are fears the outbreak could inflict serious damage on Chinese growth, already at three-decade lows. 
A Reuters poll predicts Chinese manufacturing stalled in January, after some recovery towards the end of 2019. Several Hong Kong-listed firms warned of damage to profits, and Apple CEO Tim Cook warned of supply chain disruptions.
In currencies, the offshore-traded yuan was little changed at 6.9620 per dollar but held off a one-month low reached earlier this week. Australia s dollar, which fell to three-month lows this week because of its trade and investment links with China, rose 0.2%. 
The safe-haven yen was flat but stayed below two-week highs touched on Monday. The U.S. dollar index edged off two-month highs.
The U.S. Federal Reserve meets later on Wednesday. No change in rates is expected, but speculation has risen that the coronavirus could lead the Fed to abandon its dovish stance. Money markets predict a quarter-point rate cut this year and a small chance of a second.
Fears of economic damage are reflected also in the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Three-month yields briefly rose on Tuesday above 10-year borrowing costs -- the curve inversion that sends a fairly reliable recession signal.
As calm returns to markets, the curve has returned to normal, however. Commerzbank s Guntermann said pricing rate cuts at this stage was ""ambitious"".
Treasury 10-year yields were around 1.63%, off Tuesday s three-month lows around 1.57% hit. German Bund yields also inched higher. 
On commodity markets, crude oil futures rose for the second day, after falling amid fears over economic growth and declines in travel demand, with Brent crude up 1% on the day. Gold, which had surged towards $1,600 an ounce on Monday, subsided to around $1,560

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trading on Wednesday, 29th January. Please refresh for updates.
9:00 AM ET: Mastercard  stock rose 0.9% after the company reported a 12% increase in gross dollar sales volumes in the fourth quarter to $1.73 trillion. Sales rose 28% in Europe and 9% in the U.S.  Adjusted earnings and revenue both came in slightly ahead of market forecasts.

8:56 AM ET: Dow s  stock rose 3.4% after the chemicals and plastics company said earnings and revenue fell by less than expected in the fourth quarter.
CEO Jim Fitterling said the company would continue to cut costs in the current year, while prioritizing consumer-facing sectors for investment after declines in sales at its wholesale plastics and polymers operations in the final quarter.
8:47 AM ET: Anthem  stock fell 3.6% after the health insurer gave disappointing guidance for the current year. It forecast adjusted profit to be “above $22.30” per share, compared to consensus estimates of $22.71.
The outlook overshadowed fourth-quarter results that were ahead of market expectations, thanks to a rapid rollout of its pharmacy benefits management business IngenioRx.
8:43 AM ET: AT&T  stock fell 1.5% after its fourth-quarter earnings were hit by a big drop in its PayTV subscribers – further evidence (after Comcast s update last week) that the proliferation of video streaming services is cannibalizing legacy TV businesses faster than the industry expected.  
Earnings per share were 1c ahead of consensus forecasts, but revenue missed expectations and the company’s guidance gave no indication that it would be able to improve the speed at which it’s cutting its debt burden. Net debt is forecast in a range of 2 to 2.25 times EBITDA by 2022.
8:15 AM ET: L Brands  stock rose 9.9% to a five-month high after The Wall Street Journal reported that founder Leslie Wexner is in talks to step down as CEO and find a buyer for the company that owns struggling lingerie chain Victoria’s Secret.
8:11 AM ET: Xilinx  stock fell 8.0% to an eight-week low after the chipmaker posted a sharper-than-expected decline in sales in the fourth quarter, something it blamed on a slowdown in 5G investments and government restrictions on its business with China’s Huawei. Profit fell 32%, less than feared.
Analysts estimate Huawei had accounted for as much as 8% of Xilinx’s total revenue before U.S. restrictions forced it to source chips from companies outside the U.S.
8:03 AM ET:  Apple  stock rose 1.7% to within touching distance of its record-high level of $323.32, after posting earnings for its fiscal first quarter that were 10% ahead of expectations. The company also beat on revenue after strong performances from its app store as well as its wireless AirPods and its core smartphone business.
CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the impact of the coronavirus but said the company has alternatives to its suppliers in Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. Apple  expects revenue for the current quarter to be between $63 and $67 billion, an unusually wide range that reflects the uncertainties created by the virus.
7:56 AM ET: Boeing  stock rose 1.6% after an otherwise dismal quarterly report at least included no further delays to the expected timeline for the 737 MAX’s return to service. The company lost $636 million in 2019, its worst financial result in some 20 years, while net debt rose 10% and operating cash flow turned negative to the tune of $2.4 billion. Revenue at the defense and space division also declined.
“We recognize we have a lot of work to do,"" said Boeing  President and Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun, who took over after the ousting of Dennis Muilenberg on Christmas Eve. “Fortunately, the strength of our overall Boeing portfolio of businesses provides the financial liquidity to follow a thorough and disciplined recovery process.”
The stock is still down 29% from its peak in February last year.
7:49 AM ET: Advanced Micro Devices   stock fell 4.6% after the chipmaker disappointed hopes that it will challenge Intel  for primacy in the high-margin business of selling chips to data centers. The company said quarterly sales at the unit that includes data center chips were well short of expectations, and also predicted a drop in unit sales in the current quarter.
7:42 AM ET: McDonald’s  stock fell 0.2% despite reporting comparable sales growth of 5.9% in the three months through December, above expectations of 5.2% and the highest global sales growth in more than 10 years."

Investing.com -- Strong earnings from Apple , Mastercard  left a mixed U.S. stock market fractionally higher in early trade on Wednesday, as fears about the spreading coronavirus outbreak – and thoughts about the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting – were briefly put on the backburner.
By 10:15 AM ET (1515 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60 points, or 0.2%, at 28,783 points, albeit that was off earlier highs. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite pared earlier gains to be flat on the day.
In large part, that was due to Apple , which rose 1.6% after posting better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter after the closing bell on Tuesday. The news still wasn’t quite enough to push it to a new all-time high, but strong sales at its core iPhone division, along with wearables and accessories such as its AirPods ear buds, overshadowed any concerns about possible supply disruptions at its China-based suppliers.
Mastercard fell 0.4% despite posting a 12% increase in gross dollar volume for purchases made with its cards over the holiday period. Sales rose a particularly strong 29% in Europe, despite the sustained weakness of domestic consumption in key markets.
Fallen giants Boeing  and   General Electric    also contributed to the advance. Boeing stock rose 2.6% after saying it took a total of $19 billion in charges due to the 737 MAX affair last year. While they pushed the compay to its worst annual result in over two decades, it was still less than some analysts had estimated.
For its part, GE stock rose 9.8% to its highest since October after the company announced a big increase in industrial cash flow at the end of the year. That outweighed a forecast that suggested cash flow and underlying earnings will fall in 2020, even though operating margins are set to expand further.
One underperformer was Goldman Sachs , which unveiled a medium-term target of a 14% return on tangible equity at its first-ever investor day. That’s some way below JPMorgan’s target of 17% and only just in line with Morgan Stanley’s 13%-15%. Goldman Sachs stock was down 0.7%.
Other stocks struggling included chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices  and Xilinx . AMD stock fell 7.8% to an eight-week low after disappointing fourth-quarter sales at the unit that makes chips for data centers. Investors have been betting on AMD challenging Intel  for supremacy in that lucrative and fast-growing business. Meanwhile, Xilinx stock fell 9.4% after its quarterly update exposed the damage to it from U.S. government restrictions on sales to Huawei, previously one of Xilinx’s biggest customers."

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Gold prices remained range-bound on Wednesday as markets were content to wait for the press conference of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later in the day.

The Fed’s two-day policy meeting wraps up at 2 PM ET (19:00 GMT), and Powell will speak half an hour later. Recent U.S. data – from the rise in the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index to housing starts and the better-than-expected purchasing manager index published by IHS Markit – have suggested the U.S. economy still has enough momentum not to need further stimulus.

However, markets may be more concerned about the fate of the extra liquidity that the Fed pumped into the market via repo transactions before the end of 2019. While he has denied this was a resumption of quantitative easing, the longer the liquidity stays in circulation, the more that line looks like little more than semantic nit-picking.
By 11:30 AM ET (1630 GMT), gold futures for delivery on the COMEX exchange were essentially flat at $1,569.35 a troy ounce. Spot gold was up 0.3% at $1,570.15.

Silver futures were also flat at $17.43 an ounce, while platinum futures lost another 1.7% to $977.75 and palladium futures edged down to $2,184.30 an ounce. That came against a backdrop of a report from German engineering group Robert Bosch, who said that global car sales may already have peaked. Most industrial demand for platinum group metals is down to their use in catalytic convertors in internal combustion engines.
Copper futures, meanwhile, hit their lowest in nearly four months at $2.56 a pound.
Earlier, gold had fallen as low as $1,565.40 as the market zeroed in on strong earnings reports from the likes of Apple  and Mastercard . However, there were also enough pockets of weakness to temper demand for risk assets, and lingering concerns about the impact of the novel coronavirus also returned to the fore as British Airway and Lufthansa cancelled all flights to China, while Toyota said it would suspend vehicle production in the country.
The World Health Organization said it would reconvene Wednesday to consider again whether to designate the outbreak a matter of global concern. So far, the death toll has reached 106, while the number of reported cases continues to grow at around 50% a day.
“The Fed set the bar high for further loosening at its last FOMC meeting in December by stating that a ‘material reassessment’ of the outlook would be required for the Bank to consider cutting rates again,” said Capital Economics analyst Simona Gambarini in a research note. “So while the epidemic may get worse, we doubt that the Fed would respond unless there were a much larger and sustained drop in equity prices alongside a substantial worsening in the survey data.”"

With Britain set to leave the European Union on Friday, pro-EU campaigners have managed to get the bloc’s anthem, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” to the top of U.K. download charts for Amazon.com Inc . and Apple Inc .’s music services.
But they face an expletive-laden challenger: the pro-Brexit “17 Million F***-Offs” is currently lying close behind. The song by comedian Dominic Frisby that lambastes figures such as former Prime Minister David Cameron and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and pokes fun at the idea that Brexit would be a disaster.
“It’s me, an ordinary bloke who wrote a tune with his mate one day, up against a subsidized German colossus,” Frisby said in an emailed statement from Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which is encouraging its supporters to download the single. “Not a bad metaphor for Brexit,” he said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  on Wednesday set targets to grow its fledgling consumer unit and transaction banking business while improving efficiency and returns to shareholders, but urged patience at its first-ever investor day presentation.
""We are planting seeds that will take time to mature and grow,"" Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said in an address to investors, some of whom have complained that the Wall Street powerhouse has been too slow to shift its focus away from volatile trading into the more stable consumer area. Solomon succeeded Lloyd Blankfein in October 2018.
Goldman Sachs shares, which have underperformed rivals, gave up early gains and slid 0.6 percent in mid-morning trade.
Goldman has been slower than its Wall Street rivals to develop retail banking and respond to the changing trading environment. Wednesday was an opportunity to present plans bank executives say will grow deposit balances at its consumer bank to $125 billion or more over the next five years. It targeted increasing consumer loans and card balances to more than $20 billion during the same period.
Goldman also unveiled financial targets and details on its other multibillion-dollar businesses. Its decision to hold an investor day and to set broad goals was an effort to address investor grievances about a lack of transparency.
""We believe investor patience will be important as these targets will likely be (met) toward the end of the three-year period due to the investments in and ramping (up) of ... consumer banking and transaction services,"" said Glenn Schorr, analyst at  Glencore   ISI. 
Goldman said it is aiming for a 60% efficiency ratio over the next three years, while it projected an over 13% return on equity (ROE) and over 14% return on tangible equity, which are key measures of profitability. A lower efficiency ratio means a bank is better at managing its costs relative to revenue.
Analysts noted that Goldman s improved shareholder returns target was still short of the 17 percent medium term target set by rival JPMorgan Chase & Co .
In the longer term, defined as five years or more, Goldman said it was aiming for ""mid-teen returns"" of newer businesses such as transaction banking and the consumer bank.
Goldman also plans to pull in $1 billion in revenue through lower interest expenses, according to its presentation. 
""We view these targets as approximating expectations,""  Barclays   analysts Jason Goldberg said in a research note.
Solomon said the bank s third-party alternatives investment business could add $100 billion in net inflows over time.
Trading revenues still make up roughly 40% of Goldman s revenues, but securities division executives said they are ""acutely aware"" the market for trading is shrinking and growing more competitive with the trend toward passive investing. 
Chief Operating Officer and President John Waldron said the bank was taking a ""patient, methodical, long term approach"".
Investors had been eager to hear more about the consumer bank, which consists of Goldman s online bank Marcus and its credit card with Apple . 
Marcus is a central pillar of Solomon s vision for Goldman, whose 151-year history has had very little to do with Main Street. Analysts believe it will take at least a decade for the consumer bank to become as substantial as other major businesses.
In the year ended Dec. 31, Goldman s consumer deposits stood at $60 billion and it issued $7 billion in loans and credit card balances during the fourth quarter. 

At the moment, the consumer bank generates just 2.4% of Goldman s annual revenue. "

At least 15 brokerages raised their price targets on the company s stock on Wednesday, with D.A. Davidson setting the most bullish price target of $385, well above the stock s current median price target of $325.
Sales were boosted by the first full quarter of iPhone 11, which is priced $50 less than its iPhone XR predecessor, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple watcher and managing partner at Loup Ventures.
Shares of the company rose 3% to a record high of $327.25 in early trading, providing the biggest boost to the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index.
""We see Apple s December 2019 quarter as a microcosm for its calendar 2020 performance, with the iPhone, once again, returning to the front and center,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.
Forte attributed part of the iPhone sales bounce to Apple s new credit initiatives, which enable consumers to purchase a phone and pay for it in monthly installments without paying interest.
Investors have fretted over the long-term growth prospects of Apple s phone business, which has been facing increased competition from cheaper phones from Samsung (KS:005930) and Huawei.
Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said the widely touted release of a 5G iPhone later this year would likely boost demand.
Robust demand for iPhones and wearables, including AirPod wireless headphones, during the holiday season helped the company make up for weakness in its services revenue in the company s fiscal first quarter of 2020 reported on Tuesday.
The services business, which includes the Apple TV+ streaming service, iCloud storage and fees from app developers, has consistently grown over the past two years, reaching $12.7 billion in revenue in the quarter.
Cowen and Co analyst Krish Sankar noted that the services segment reached its $50 billion run rate target ahead of schedule, saying that the company s pivot to a content-focused recurring revenue model is a powerful long-term earnings driver."

The products are expected include a low-cost 4.7-inch iPhone, refreshes of the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro/Air, high-end headphones and a small wireless charging mat.

""If there are no significant improvements regarding the coronavirus epidemic in the foreseeable future, we predict that Apple  may delay new material adoptions or lower test requirements for components to shorten qualification processes and launch new products in 2H20 on schedule, and the lower spec will likely hurt the (average selling price) of materials or components,"" wrote Kuo, according to MacRumor.

Investing.com  - The S&P eased from highs Wednesday, as coronavirus fears kept a lid on gains, but investor sentiment was supported by a surge in Apple  to record highs on bullish quarterly earnings.

The S&P 500 rose 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.27% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.38%.

Apple s better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results released Tuesday saw its shares climb to record highs intraday, setting a positive tone for corporate earnings amid a slew of reports from blue chips like McDonald’s ,   General Electric    and Boeing .

McDonald s rose 2% after its quarterly results and U.S. comparable-store sales topped Wall Street estimates, driven by price hikes at its U.S. stores.

GE surged 10% after its quarterly results beat on both the top and bottom lines, led by strength in its aviation business. The company also reported free cash flow of $3.9 billion, exceeding its target for the full year.

Boeing shrugged off weaker-than-expected results, rising about 3%, as the aircraft maker posted its first annual loss in more than a decade, owing to losses from the grounding of its 737 Max jets.
Chip stocks, however, gave up some gains from a day earlier, pressured by a slump in Advanced Micro Devices Inc  as the chipmaker s earnings beat was overshadowed by signs of weakness in its gaming business ahead of the launch of new consoles.

Media stocks also suffered losses, led by a slump in AT&T  following its quarterly earnings miss amid a loss in cable subscriptions as the cord-cutting phenomenon continued.
Bullish sentiment on stocks has been kept in check by signs that the coronavirus continues to spread, with the death toll in China rising to 132 and the number of infected topping 6,000.
Energy also stifled upside, as losses in oil prices fell in the wake of data showing a larger-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude supplies at a time when many fear the virus outbreak in China will hamper travel, leading to lower oil demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Wednesday, as an initial boost from the likes of Apple, Boeing and  General Electric  following their quarterly results faded in the wake of a policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
Stocks initially showed little reaction to the Fed s policy statement but steadily lost ground on the heels of a news conference by chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed held rates steady as expected while offering no new guidance on its balance sheet, but Powell noted ""uncertainties about the outlook remain"" and noted the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Since the Fed s last rate cut in October, its third reduction of 2019, policymakers have agreed to keep their target policy rate in the current range of 1.50% and 1.75%. 
Apple Inc  gained 2.09% after the iPhone maker late on Tuesday reported earnings for the holiday shopping quarter that topped analysts  expectations, even as it braced for more disruptions in virus-hit China.
 Boeing Co   rose 1.72% after the planemaker forecast nearly $19 billion in costs related to the grounding of its 737 MAX jets, smaller than what many analysts had expected, and helping offset the company s report of its first annual loss since 1997.
Several companies have warned of disruption to their operations due to the coronavirus outbreak, and a Chinese government economist was quoted as saying the country s economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower.
""I don’t mean to minimize the human impact of the virus but what is more concerning to me is not that the market has not responded to the virus but rather that it was up so strongly in the first 2-1/2 weeks of January after a very, very strong 2019,"" said Ellen Hazen, portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts. 
""The market does seem to have gotten ahead of itself."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 11.6 points, or 0.04%, to 28,734.45, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 2.84 points, or 0.09%, to 3,273.4 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 5.48 points, or 0.06%, to 9,275.16.
As earnings gather pace, analysts expect profit for S&P 500 companies to be flat in the fourth quarter, an improvement over the 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season, according to Refinitiv data.
General Electric  jumped 10.32% after the industrial conglomerate set a higher cash target for 2020.
 Starbucks Corp   dropped 2.12% after warning of a financial hit as it closed thousands of restaurants and adjusted operating hours in China.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 65 new lows.

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The outbreak of a new virus that originated in the central-Chinese city of Wuhan is likely to slow China s economic growth at least in the near term and could hurt its trading partners around the world.
The potential effects of the spread of the coronavirus, which has sickened more than 6,000, mostly in China, and killed 133 since its detection early last month, took center stage in U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell s news conference on Wednesday following the central bank s widely expected decision to keep interest rates unchanged.
The Fed is ""very carefully monitoring the situation,"" Powell told reporters.
While Powell noted that it is ""too early to say"" what the extent of the impact on the United States will be, he said it is ""a significant thing which will have some effects on the Chinese economy, at least in the short term.""
A Chinese government economist earlier on Wednesday projected the outbreak would cut China s first-quarter growth by one percentage point to 5% or lower.
Powell also acknowledged the risks, including to the U.S. economy, from any slowdown in the world s second-biggest economy.
""China s economy is very important in the global economy now, and when China s economy slows down we do feel that - not as much though as countries that are near China, or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries,"" Powell said.
China has imposed travel restrictions and shut businesses and schools in an attempt to contain the outbreak, but it has not quelled rising concern among companies and governments across the world, some of whom are taking swift action.
Airlines including British Airways , United Airlines  and Lufthansa  are cutting or suspending flights, tourists are canceling trips, and businesses including Apple  and Starbucks are warning of the potential impact on their supply chains and sales.
Starbucks  has closed more than half its cafes in China and Walt  Disney   shut its resorts and theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong during what is usually its busiest time of year. Alphabet Inc s  Google has said it is temporarily shutting down its offices in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
""The coronavirus will likely have the largest negative impact on goods and services sectors within and outside of China that rely on Chinese consumers and intermediary products,"" Moody s analysts said in a report on Wednesday.
The assessments suggest the impact could be larger than that of the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, the last novel virus to cause global alarm.
That outbreak resulted in about 800 deaths and slowed Asia s economic growth. But the overall effect on the U.S. economy was ultimately limited and short-lived.
But as the Moody s analysts and others point out, China accounts for a bigger share of global economic growth now than it did then, and the world is more closely connected.
Over the past week, amid news of coronavirus cases in the United States and more than a dozen other countries, trading in U.S. Treasuries reflected rising concern about a spillover effect.
Futures tied to the Fed s target policy rate also moved in the past week, and are now pricing in bets the Fed will cut interest rates again in July.
CAREFUL COMMENTS
In his news conference on Wednesday, Powell gave no hint the central bank plans to lower borrowing costs anytime soon. Indeed, he suggested the global risks from uncertain trade policy and slowing global growth, which prompted the Fed s three rate cuts in 2019, looked to be receding, prompting ""cautious optimism"" on the U.S. economic outlook this year.
Still, his careful comments about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak likely reflects behind-the-scenes work by Fed staffers, who brief policymakers at each meeting on risks to the economic outlook.
The Fed s May 2003 policy meeting, which occurred as the extent of the SARS epidemic was becoming apparent, began with a briefing on uncertainties, including the effect of the outbreak on various Asian economies and the potential knock-on impact for the U.S. economy, a transcript of the meeting shows."

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The California Institute of Technology said on Wednesday that it won a $1.1 billion jury verdict in a patent case against Apple  and Broadcom .
In a case filed in federal court in Los Angeles in 2016, the Pasadena, California-based research university alleged that Broadcom wi-fi chips used in hundreds of millions of Apple iPhones infringed patents relating to data transmission technology.
""While we thank the members of the jury for their service, we disagree with the factual and legal bases for the verdict and intend to appeal,"" Broadcom said in a statement.
Apple said it plans to appeal the verdict, but declined further comment. The company had said in court filings that it believed all of the university s claims against it resulted from its using Broadcom s chips in its devices, calling itself ""merely an indirect downstream party.""
Broadcom is a major Apple supplier, deriving about a fifth of its sales from the iPhone maker in its fiscal 2019. Last week Broadcom said it had signed deals to sell as much as $15 billion worth of chips to Apple.
The verdict awarded CalTech $837.8 million from Apple and $270.2 million from Broadcom.

""We are pleased the jury found that Apple and Broadcom infringed Caltech patents,"" CalTech said in a statement. ""As a non-profit institution of higher education, Caltech is committed to protecting its intellectual property in furtherance of its mission to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education."""

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc   said on Wednesday that growth would continue to slow as its business matured and it reported a surge in quarterly expenses, disappointing Wall Street expectations that the costs of improving privacy would level off.
The news raised concerns that Facebook s days of astronomical growth were firmly in the rearview mirror, and shares of the world s biggest social network dropped 7.2% in extended trading.
Facebook reported its slowest-ever revenue growth for the fourth quarter, at 25%, and Facebook s chief financial officer, David Wehner, said on a call with investors that the pace of expansion will slow further in the first quarter of 2020. Wehner forecast a percentage point decline in the growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits, citing Facebook s maturing business, the impact of global privacy regulation and concerns about ad targeting.
""We have experienced some modest impact from these headwinds to date. The majority of the impact lies in front of us,"" Wehner said. 
He specifically noted changes made by Apple Inc  and Alphabet Inc s  Google, which have both announced new restrictions on browser cookies used to track users online.
Facebook, the world s second-biggest seller of online ads, has been under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy practices. It is also facing heat over how its services have been manipulated to spread misinformation.
The company addressed those issues starting in mid-2018 following repeated scandals, causing growth in expenses to surge by more than 100% for several quarters as it hired privacy staff and invested in content moderation.
That investment began declining last year, leading analysts to believe Facebook was largely finished building out its new systems and beginning to find efficiencies that could whittle costs further.
But the company reported total costs and expenses increased 34% to $12.22 billion in the fourth quarter, more than double the 14% that analysts had forecast and dragging down operating margins to 42% from 46% a year earlier.
It also announced it had reached a $550 million settlement in principle of an Illinois lawsuit that claimed it illegally collected and stored biometric data for millions of users without their consent.
The fourth-quarter revenue growth https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/FACEBOOK-RESULTS/0H001R885BN9/index.html of 25% did beat analysts  expectations of a dip to 23%. But it is the company s fourth straight quarter of revenue growth less than 30%, playing to concerns that Facebook is struggling to restore its pre-2018 momentum when sales regularly grew upwards of 40%.
Still, Facebook s shares rose more than 50% over the last year, raising pressure for a strong performance.
""FB stock had made a big run-up in anticipation of the report ...so the room for error was low,"" said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co.
The company continued to add users, beating estimates. Monthly users of Facebook s core social network climbed 8% to 2.5 billion, while 2.9 billion people used one of its apps - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger - each month.
That unique reach keeps advertisers dependent on Facebook s apps and online ad network. Facebook has also been trying to build out e-commerce offerings in the last year like Instagram Checkout, which make shopping more convenient by allowing users to complete transactions from within Facebook s apps.
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in the investor call that the company is moving ""very slowly and very, very carefully"" with those products.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who has come under fire over Facebook s decision to permit political ads that include false information and lies, said he would also focus the company on communicating Facebook s values more clearly.
The company had generated ""positive but shallow sentiment"" by trying to be liked and avoid causing offense over the past decade, he said. ""My goal for this next decade isn t to be liked, but to be understood.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930) is counting on a gradual recovery in memory chip demand from data centers and 5G smartphone makers to help it bounce back in 2020 after sliding to its worst operating profit in four years. 
But in a guarded outlook, the world s biggest memory chip and smartphone maker said on Thursday it couldn t rule out the possibility that demand growth may be curbed amid lingering tensions on U.S.-China trade and looming fears of the economic impact of the new coronavirus outbreak in China and beyond.
The conservative forecast failed to satisfy investors hoping for a brighter outlook, and the company s shares ended down 3.2%, having fallen as much as 3.9% at one point, while the Seoul market benchmark was off 1.7%.
Samsung, which counts smartphone rivals Apple Inc  and Huawei Technologies Co as customers for its chips and displays, said fourth-quarter operating profit slumped to 7.16 trillion won ($6.13 billion) on weaker chip demand, down 34% from the same period a year earlier.
That was in line with its own estimate, though net profit for the quarter skidded 38% to 5.2 trillion won, meaning Samsung missed analysts  estimate of 5.6 trillion won.
The October-December quarter marks the end of a year marred by bloated stockpiles of chips that squeezed prices, and the U.S.-China trade war that roiled global supply chains and prospects for consumer demand. For the year, the South Korean conglomerate posted operating profit of 27.8 trillion won, its lowest since 2015.
Samsung said it also expected January-March earnings to fall from the preceding quarter, reflecting low seasonal demand for chips and displays. 
Speaking during a conference call, a Samsung chip executive flagged uncertainties in chip demand.
""The macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns are showing signs of easing recently, but we can t rule out the possibility that the situation would deteriorate,"" said Han Jin-man, senior vice president at Samsung s semiconductor business unit. He didn t identify specific issues that could affect the company. 
VIRUS OUTBREAK 
In contrast with Samsung s modest forecast, chip peers like  Intel Corp   and TSMC (TW:2330) earlier offered positive outlooks, fuelling hopes of a rebound in chip prices after a slide that started in late 2018.
""Samsung offered a conservative outlook for the memory market, and there is a disconnect between market views and the company views when it comes to strength of the recovery,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
Meanwhile, after posting strong results, Apple earlier this week flagged uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China which economists fear could hurt the global economy.
On Thursday Samsung Electronics, which has chip, display and home appliance plants in China, declined to comment on the impact of the outbreak on demand. In a statement to Reuters, it said it had extended a holiday closure for some factories in line with Chinese government guidance. 
But supplier  Samsung SDI  (KS:006400), which makes phone batteries and materials for chips and displays, said it expects current-quarter earnings to be adversely affected by the virus outbreak.
Fourth-quarter operating profit more than halved to 3.45 trillion won in Samsung s mainstay chip division, while its mobile division profit surged by two-thirds to 2.52 trillion won, thanks to strong sales of flagship models and a revamp of its mid- and lower-end A series line-up. 
Samsung said the actual pace of 5G network expansion and its effects on memory demand remains to be seen, although the company sees demand picking up around mass-market 5G models. 
It said it aims to expand its presence in the 5G network equipment market in the United States, while continuing to look at the possibility of entering the European market.

This week Britain granted Huawei a limited role in developing the country s 5G mobile network, frustrating a global attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West s next-generation communications."

Investing.com - Global financial markets were whipsawed this week, with stocks indices in the U.S., Europe and Asia all heading for their worst weekly loss in about four months, as concerns grew over the coronavirus outbreak centered in Wuhan, China.

China s National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths from the virus rose to 170 as of late Wednesday. The number of infected patients meanwhile jumped to nearly 8,000.
A small number of cases linked to people who traveled from Wuhan have been confirmed in about 15 countries, including the United States, Canada, France, Japan and South Korea.
In addition to the coronavirus, market players reacted to the latest figures from a deluge of big-name companies, as the fourth-quarter earnings season continues on Wall Street.

Apple  was in the spotlight on Tuesday after the iPhone maker beat sales and profit estimates for the holiday shopping quarter. The company reported earnings per share of $4.99 on revenue of $91.82 billion, both topping expectations.
The earnings beat comes as iPhone sales returned to growth, with new iPhone 11 models sparking the boost. The company also provided better than expected guidance for its fiscal second-quarter revenue.
On Wednesday, the hype was all around Tesla , a stock that’s up more than 80% in the last three months and now sporting a market cap of more than $100 billion.

The electric automaker posted its second quarterly profit in a row as vehicle deliveries hit a record and the company said it would comfortably make more than half a million units this year, pushing its shares to new highs above $600.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers overwhelmingly called on Thursday for rules to establish a common charger for all mobile device makers across Europe, a drive that iPhone maker Apple  has criticised.
Members of the European Parliament voted by 582-40 for a resolution urging the European Commission, which drafts EU laws, to ensure that EU consumers are no longer obliged to buy new chargers with each new device.
The Commission should adopt new rules by July, the lawmakers  resolution said.
The resolution said voluntary agreements in the industry had significantly reduced the number of charger types, but had not resulted in one common standard.
Electronic waste, the resolution said, was some 16.6 kilograms (36.6 pounds) per EU inhabitant in 2016, for a total of 12.3 million tonnes, an unnecessarily large amount.
The resolution also said wireless charging could prove beneficial by mitigating waste, but urged the Commission to adopt rules that ensured wireless chargers were able to charge many different mobile devices.
A move to a common charger would affect Apple more than any other company as iPhones and most of its mobile products are powered by its Lightning cable, whereas Android devices are powered by USB-C connectors.
Apple said last week that the industry was already moving to USB-C and that regulation to force conformity would stifle innovation, harming European consumers. An abrupt switch would itself result in a mountain of e-waste, it said.
The European Commission, which acts as the executive for the EU, has been pushing for a common charger for more than a decade.
In 2009 it got four companies including Apple, Samsung (KS:005930), Huawei [HWT.UL} and Nokia  to sign a voluntary memorandum of understanding to harmonize chargers for new models of smartphones coming into the market in 2011."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China could start to disrupt India s production of smartphones if it continues to spread in February, industry executives said, as it could delay component shipments.
India is the world s biggest smartphone maker after China but is still largely dependent on China for supplies of parts such as cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards. 
Taiwan s Foxconn and Wistron make iPhones in India for Apple , and Foxconn produces phones there for China s Xiaomi as well. Other smartphone makers in India include South Korea s Samsung (KS:005930) and China s OnePlus.
So far smartphone makers in India have weathered the impact of the virus, which has already killed 170 people, partly because they had ramped up inventories of Chinese-made parts anyway to cover the Lunar New Year holiday period when China s factories close down.
""Those disruptions were already planned but if it (the virus  spread) gets prolonged then for March and April production we will have serious trouble,"" said S.N. Rai, the co-founder of homegrown smartphone maker Lava. ""We re definitely worried about it.""
Some components can be shipped in from markets such as South Korea, Vietnam or Taiwan, but smartphone makers will only make such purchases as a ""last resort"" as it would force companies to make changes including in design and software, Rai said.
China s OnePlus said its Indian operations could manage, in the short term at least.
""We are well covered because we have the entire production in India, we already have enough stock, and even going forward many of the components will anyway be coming directly from other markets,"" said Vikas Agarwal, the India head of OnePlus.
While Beijing has expressed confidence in defeating the ""devil"" virus, which is yet to be declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, major companies such as Alphabet  Inc s Google and Sweden s IKEA have closed operations in China.
India s Tata Motors, which counts China as a major market for its luxury Jaguar Land Rover cars, said on Thursday it was worried about the coronavirus and warned that the outbreak could hit profits.
As several airlines suspend flights to China, the movement of technical staff from the country - such as on-site support executives, machine and automation specialists - will also be curtailed and that will hit India s smartphone sector, an executive at another foreign-owned smartphone maker, who did not wish to be named, said.
For now, the industry just hopes the outbreak can be contained within the next two weeks.

""If the problem persists beyond Feb. 10 then we have a real problem at hand,"" said Pankaj Mohindroo, head of the India Cellular & Electronics Association, an industry lobby group."

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc  shares fell about 1% on Thursday as quarterly profits missed estimates even though the company added more monthly mobile phone subscribers than expected as adding the Disney+ streaming service helped some of its plans.
The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has cut prices and made its offerings more attractive by bundling services such as Apple  Music to battle intense competition in the industry.
The company said that in the fourth quarter, it added 790,000 phone customers who pay a monthly bill, well above the average analysts  estimate of 525,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet. 
Verizon s reported post-paid phone churn of 1.13% for the fourth quarter, the seventh consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts at New Street Research said lowering churn would be more difficult with shift in the wireless market.
Total operating revenue rose to $34.78 billion from $34.28 billion, beating the estimate of $34.60 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In October, Verizon said it would offer a year-long subscription to Walt  Disney  Co s  Disney+ with its unlimited plans, a move aimed at rival AT&T Inc , which is expected to launch its own streaming platform HBO Max in May. 
Revenue in Verizon s media unit, which includes Yahoo , HuffPost and TechCrunch, was nearly flat at $2.1 billion from a year earlier. The company said it wrote down $236 million during the fourth quarter for the media business, which has struggled to grow as ad revenue moved to larger digital players like Alphabet s Google .
Net income rose to $5.22 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $2.07 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. The company also recorded a $2.2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate.
The company built out its network of 5G in Kansas City, Little Rock and Cincinnati, rolling out the next generation of wireless in 34 cities in 2019. Verizon said it expects to spend $17 billion to $18 billion in expanding 5G, ramping up its 4G and building out more fiber. 
Verizon said that building out its own multi-use fiber will help increase revenue for its business segment. 
""I think this is one of the most critical assets in a network today -- in today s world, especially as we build a Verizon intelligent network,"" Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said during a conference call. 
Verizon reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, missing Wall Street estimates of $1.14.

The smaller-than-expected loss capped a rough year marked by a management shake-up and job cuts even as the South Korean company invests to shift its focus to next-generation organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels.
The company however predicted meaningful opportunities for earnings improvement from the second half, LG Display Senior Vice President Suh Dong-hee said in a statement, as the company s OLED plant in China will ramp up production.
LG Display posted a loss of 422 billion won ($361.6 million) in the October-December quarter, compared with an operating profit of 279 billion won in the same period a year ago.
Analysts expected a 578 billion won loss, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate based on estimates of 22 analysts.
""We will make efforts to achieve a significant revenue increase in large-size OLED panels as our OLED plant in China will ramp up production,"" Suh said. 
The company launched a voluntary redundancy program last year and said earlier this month it would halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by the end of this year. Related one-time restructuring costs weighed on its results, analysts said.
LG Display reported a loss of 1.4 trillion won in 2019, its worst financial performance in eight years. 
LCD panel prices have been falling for years in a market crowded by Chinese rivals. The glut has forced LG Display and rival Samsung Display - a unit of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) - to cut supplies, a move that analysts said could take some pressure off prices in the first half of the year.
But on Thursday, Samsung Electronics said it expected the business to remain weak this year.

LG Display said last year it would invest roughly $2.6 billion in its OLED panels production line in South Korea. "

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  on Thursday posted holiday quarter results well above expectations as the expansion of its one-day shipping program came under budget and membership in its Prime loyalty club notched a 50% rise in two years.
Shares soared as much as 13% in after-hours trade, putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion market capitalization club. If the share gain holds on Friday, it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017.
Amazon also forecast operating income of up to $4.2 billion in the current quarter, down from $4.4 billion the year prior. Still, that appeared to assuage investor concerns about Amazon s continued spending on fast delivery, which could have erased windfalls from e-commerce, advertising and cloud computing sales.
""We’re past the worst in terms of the margin pressure from the one-day shipping initiative,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. That and the ""massively overstated"" concerns about cloud competition rebutted some of the biggest arguments against buying the stock, he said.
Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters that additional investment in one-day shipping came slightly under the $1.5 billion the company had forecast for the fourth quarter, despite more customer orders. Extra costs in the current period will be about $1 billion for the delivery effort, he said.
Olsavsky added that spending on video would rise going forward, but the company was still determining its overall level of investment for 2020.
Jeff Bezos, Amazon s chief executive, said in a statement that the world s biggest online retailer now has more than 150 million paid members in its loyalty club Prime, a 50% increase from its last disclosure in April 2018.
Subscribers keep returning to Amazon to benefit from perks like fast delivery, television and music streaming. Its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers has prompted still more engagement from customers, and grocery orders more than doubled in the holiday quarter in a vote of confidence for Amazon s 2017 bet to buy Whole Foods Market.
This formula has helped make Bezos the richest person in the world.
Amazon is hoping that cutting delivery times to one day for Prime members will let it outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart Inc  that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. The company made progress in the holiday season, reporting that it quadrupled one-day and same-day deliveries over the year-ago quarter.
Revenue from subscription fees grew 32% to $5.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, as more shoppers signed up for Prime than in any period prior.
WATCHING CORONAVIRUS
Net sales rose 21% to $87.4 billion while net income rose 8% to $3.3 billion - each over $1 billion more than analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The profit rise reflects the evolving nature of Amazon s business. The company has been moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it takes lucrative fees for shipping and advertising the products of other merchants on its platform.
This has helped weather massive spending at Amazon, a company that has long passed up short-term results in favor of bets that could reap it future profit.
For instance, faster delivery has meant a surge in hiring and related costs. The company said its full-time and part-time headcount rose 23% to 798,000 in the quarter, as it expanded both fulfillment and corporate software roles.
Expenses similarly grew as the company moved inventory closer to customers and built out its last-mile delivery network, which now handles the biggest share of Amazon-ordered packages in the United States. Amazon said worldwide shipping costs rose 43% to $12.9 billion.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has seen infrastructure and marketing costs rise. The unit responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud lost out to  Microsoft Corp   in a high-profile deal last quarter to sell technology to the U.S. Department of Defense, in what could have netted the company $10 billion over a decade. Amazon is contesting the contract decision.
Microsoft on Wednesday reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales for its Azure cloud computing service. Yet Amazon posted better results than feared, growing revenue 34% to $9.95 billion, similar to its third-quarter increase.
""This is important because it ends six quarters of measurable decline in AWS growth, reassuring investors that the segment has signs of stability,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said in a research note.
Amazon s international business also narrowed losses to $617 million in the fourth quarter. The company has less exposure to China than Apple Inc  and other technology industry peers, which may help it weather economic uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Olsavsky said Amazon is watching the situation very carefully and is starting to put China travel restrictions on employees. The company considers China to be a far less strategic market than India, which CEO Bezos visited earlier this month partly to announce a new $1 billion investment in the country.

Equities were higher from Tokyo and Seoul to Hong Kong and Sydney, though came off their highs Friday after the U.S. raised its warning against travel to China. Treasuries were little changed, while oil prices recouped most of their Thursday loss. U.S. futures edged up after the S&P 500 Index closed higher in a late-session rebound.
Economic indicators and corporate earnings reports have largely shown that global growth was brightening before the coronavirus hit; Amazon.com Inc . reported a blow-out quarter late Thursday, and Friday Japan unveiled a pick-up in industrial output.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is still heading for the worst weekly slide since May 2019, when the U.S.-China trade war roiled markets. China faces a turbulent reopening of financial markets on Monday, when mainland stocks will need to catch up with the sell-off since they last traded Jan. 23.
While the epidemic that began in China continues to spread and the human toll mounts, the World Health Organization Thursday commended China’s efforts to contain the disease. It declared a global health emergency, acting after many airlines around the world had already decided to halt flights to China, with some countries closing borders to the nation.
Tesla  Inc. expects a production delay in China, McDonald’s Corp. and  Starbucks Corp  . closed thousands of stores combined in the country while Apple Inc . is preparing for supply-chain disruptions. Cutting against the coronavirus news, Amazon topped a $1 trillion market capitalization in after-hours trading after reporting a 21% surge in fourth-quarter sales and profit that crushed Wall Street estimates.

The e-commerce giant re-entered the $1 trillion club after its results crushed expectations, benefiting from investments in faster shipping and a surge in Prime membership.
Nearly half of the 51 brokerages covering Amazon raised their 12-month price targets on the company s stock, which was up 9% at $2,036 in early trading.
In a note titled ""Not-so-subtle Reminder Amazon is Still King"", Benchmark analysts said Amazon reminded the world of its ""size and capacity advantage,"" and raised his price target by $150 to $2,400.
Net sales jumped 21% to $87.4 billion, with sales from AWS - the business responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud - growing 34%. Revenue from subscription fees surged 32% as more shoppers signed up for Prime services.
""Amazon is easily less than half-way through transforming retail by exploiting deep fulfillment moats established over many years,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.
J.P.Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target on the stock to $2,525 from $2,200, and said Amazon remains one of the brokerage s top picks in its U.S. focus list.
""Overall, in our view Amazon s ability to re-accelerate revenue growth at such a large scale is evidence that its (Prime One Day) investments are paying off,"" Anmuth said.
""We re increasingly optimistic Amazon will continue to execute throughout 2020 on both the top and bottom line.""
Amazon has been in and around the $1 trillion club for a while now, accompanied by the other tech giants like Apple Inc , Alphabet Inc  and  Microsoft Corp  .
Investors and analysts are touting  Visa Inc   and Mastercard Inc  as the next companies in line to move in to the elite list.
At a time when Amazon has been trying to improve its delivery timings through in-house initiatives, the company s fortunes could be intertwined with that of its delivery partner  United Parcel  Service Inc , which earns more than one-tenth of its revenue through its partnership with the Washington-based company."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tech and internet titans were the first to reach $1 trillion in stock market value, but the next U.S. companies that could do so are better known for their plastic. Soaring stock prices are propelling credit and debit card companies  Visa Inc   and Mastercard Inc  up the market value charts, where they currently rank 7th and 11th among companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock prices of both Visa and Mastercard have gained roughly 50% in the past year. While the stocks may not keep up that torrid pace, Visa and Mastercard would each be worth over $1 trillion by 2023 if their average annual gains of the past three years were to continue, surging past the likes of  Facebook Inc   and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, if they also maintain their recent pace.
Fueling their rise is a shift toward cashless financial transactions spurred by a rise in online shopping.
""Everything travels on their rails,"" said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, which holds Visa shares. ""They literally sit in the middle of the banks, consumers and merchants and that has been a really enviable place to be.""
Visa had a market value of $449 billion and Mastercard s stood at about $324 billion as of Thursday s close. The $1 trillion club currently includes Apple Inc , Microsoft , and Google-parent Alphabet . Amazon .com s market value jumped back above $1 trillion on Friday morning as the stock soared on the heels of its earnings report on Thursday. 
(GRAPHIC: Top U.S. market cap companies - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R88DBP0/eikon.png)
Revenue for both Visa and Mastercard nearly doubled over their past five fiscal years, to nearly $23 billion for Visa, and about $17 billion for Mastercard, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period.
Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates. About 43% of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28% in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Globally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,” Ellis said. Visa holds a 60% share of the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30%, according to Ellis, with  American Express   far behind at 8.5%. Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are categorized as part of the S&P 500 s information technology sector. While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies such as  Intel Corp   often garner the lion s share of attention, Visa and Mastercard have been key contributors to the rally in technology shares. Their valuations have expanded to their most expensive in at least a decade. Visa trades at nearly 32 times forward 12 months  earnings estimates, while Mastercard trades at 35 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Both stocks are trading at a higher premium to the market than they have on average over the past five years.
(Graphic: Top U.S. market cap companies - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R88DBP0/eikon.png) 
The big run for Visa and Mastercard shares has also come during an more than 10-year U.S. bull market, and gains could be more muted in any downturn. Stocks started 2020 strong but have pulled back amid concerns over the spread of a virus from China.
Risks to the companies, Ellis said, include greater competition in the payment sector from big tech companies, as well as tougher regulations from governments around the world that might hinder access.
The companies are not sitting still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy privately held Plaid Inc in a $5.3 billion deal to boost access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard agreed to buy a majority of the corporate services businesses of Scandinavian payments group Nets for about $3.19 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A future U.S.-UK trade agreement must incorporate strong provisions on worker rights, environmental protection, and enforcement to ensure bipartisan support, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said on Friday, staking out a claim for Congress to help shape any such accord.
Neal, a Democrat, said he expected to work closely with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in forging a new U.S.-UK trade deal after Britain s left the European Union on Friday.
Britain is the closest U.S. ally but the two countries face big hurdles in working out a new trade agreement, including a dispute over Britain s plan to impose a unilateral digital tax.
Washington argues that such taxes would discriminate against big U.S. tech companies like Alphabet  Inc s  Google, Apple Inc ,  Facebook Inc   and Amazon.com .
Neal s comments came days after President Donald Trump signed a revamped North American trade accord at a White House ceremony that excluded Neal and other House Democrats who ensured its congressional passage by adding better protections for workers  rights and the environment, increased enforcement and measures to avert higher drug prices.
Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers are growing concerned that Trump is circumventing Congress s constitutional role in setting trade policy by imposing tariffs and signing smaller trade deals that do not need congressional approval.
Neal s comments made clear that U.S. lawmakers expect to be consulted on a U.S.-UK trade deal after being shut out of Washington s bilateral trade negotiations with China, Japan and others.
He said the new U.S.-UK trade deal also needed to preserve the freedom of Congress to regulate areas of domestic policy, and respect the achievement of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement between the British and Irish governments, and most of the political parties in Northern Ireland.
Senator Chris Murphy, also a Democrat, said the two countries should ultimately reach a free trade agreement, but said Washington should not reward Britain for leaving the EU and should focus first on reaching a trade deal with Brussels.
In addition to disputes over digital taxes, the Trump administration has also threatened to tax foreign car imports, which could hit British-made Jaguar, Land Rover , Mini , and Honda Civic hatchback (T:7267) cars.
Britain and the United States are also at odds over London s decision this week give the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a limited role in Britain’s 5G mobile network."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The number of deaths from a coronavirus epidemic in China has risen by 46 to 259, the country s health authority said on Saturday, as the United States and other nations announced new border curbs on foreigners who have been in China.
The central province of Hubei, the center of the epidemic, is under a virtual quarantine, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. Elsewhere in China, authorities have placed restrictions on travel and business activity in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.
In its latest figures, China s National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported confirmed cases of the virus.
Amid growing international concern, Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to restrict entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China.
Australia followed suit, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying the country will deny entry to all foreign nationals traveling from mainland China from Saturday.
""We re in fact operating with an abundance of caution in these circumstances,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney. ""So Australians can go about their daily lives with confidence.""
However, the World Health Organization, which this week declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, reiterated global trade and travel restrictions were not needed.
""We would want countries to focus on the mitigation efforts of identifying the possible importation of cases and responding to any domestic outbreak,"" China WHO representative Gauden Galea told Reuters on Saturday.
Qantas Airways Ltd and Air New Zealand said international travel bans had forced them to suspend their direct flights to China from Feb. 9.
All three major U.S. airlines said on Friday they would cancel flights to mainland China.
Nearly 10,000 flights have been suspended since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, according to travel and data analytics firm Cirium, illustrating concerns about a slowdown in economic activity in China and elsewhere.
EVACUATIONS
Many nations have put on special charter flights to repatriate citizens from China.
More than 300 South Koreans arrived home on Saturday on a second charter flight from China and have been transported to a facility where they will be isolated for two weeks, the health ministry said. Seven people on the flight exhibited symptoms and were sent to hospital.
Indonesian officials said around 250 nationals being evacuated from Hubei will be quarantined on a military base on the remote Natuna Islands.
Britain said it was withdrawing some staff from its embassy and consulates in China.
""In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited,"" the UK government said in a statement.
Infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan, raising concerns that new hot spots are emerging despite strict travel restrictions.
In one of them, Huanggang, authorities are requiring households to designate one individual who can leave the home, a local newspaper said. The city has a population of about 7.5 million.
The northern city of Tianjin, with a population of about 15 million, suspended all schools and businesses until further notice, joining other cities across China in implementing measures aimed at curbing the spread of the pathogen.
A senior leadership group tasked with handling the crisis promised to take action to prevent a big surge in the number of people traveling after the extended Lunar New Year holiday.
The team led by Premier Li Keqiang said they would coordinate with local governments to stagger the times when people are asked to go back to work.
Although the WHO has praised China s efforts to contain the virus, the U.S.-based China Human Rights Defenders urged Beijing to ease restrictions on movement and counter discrimination against residents of Wuhan and Hubei.
""Human rights must not be a casualty of the government’s work to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 200 people and affected millions,"" the group said.
BUSINESSES, EVENTS DISRUPTED
Still, efforts to contain the virus have caused major disruptions and threaten to exacerbate a slowdown in the world s second-biggest economy.
Growth had already slowed in the fourth-quarter to a 30-year low of 6%. But the impact of the virus prompted Capital Economics to almost halve its estimate for first-quarter growth to 3% from 5.7%.
China s central bank said the impact was temporary and economic fundamentals remained sound, but it would increase monetary and credit support, including lowering lending costs for affected companies.
The United Nations has announced it has moved a key round of talks on a new biodiversity treaty originally scheduled to take place in Kunming in southwest China on Feb. 24. The talks will now take place in Rome.
Several high-profile sporting events have also been moved or postponed, the latest a badminton Olympic qualifier in Hainan province."

Out in California executives of REC Group organized a supply chain war room to plan around an anticipated trucking shortage and port logjam in China. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is rallying support for an emergency OPEC meeting on concern oil demand will falter.
Since China’s last health crisis, the SARS outbreak of 2003, its share of global economic output has quadrupled to about 17%. It’s now the biggest market for new cars and semiconductors, the largest spender on international tourism, the leading exporter of clothing and textiles, and the land where many PCs and virtually all iPhones are made. The global hit from this new outbreak could be three to four times larger than the $40 billion blow from SARS, estimates Warwick McKibbin, a professor of economics at Australian National University.
Thus far, China has absorbed most of the economic shock from the coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV, which has killed more than 210 within its borders and infected over 9,950 globally. Wuhan, the city with 11 million residents where the virus came to light, remains closed off from the world. Under a government-mandated extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, provinces generating at least two-thirds of economic output will be shuttered through next week, including Shanghai and key eastern manufacturing hubs.
All the while, the virus’s toll continues to rise -- and with it the worry. China’s essential role in the global supply chain means business owners and executives around the world are being forced to contemplate what will happen in a prolonged crisis.
“Everyone is waiting to see how this evolves,” said Miguel Patricio, the chief executive officer of Kraft Heinz  Co. The food giant has a couple thousand employees in China, including a small sales team in Wuhan. “The danger, of course, is that if this continues and people have to stay home, you start having problems in terms of distribution, production.”
Closed Doors
Four months ago, Levi Strauss  & Co. opened the doors to a flashy new flagship store in Wuhan, a booming manufacturing powerhouse that alternately gets called the Chicago or Detroit of China. The location features three levels of premium collections and a massive tailor shop. At just over 7,500 square feet (697 square meters), the location is twice as big as any other Levi franchises in China. The mega-store was heralded by top executives as a symbol of a new era of growth for the brand in the country.
Today, like almost everything else in town, the store is shut. A major component of Levi’s growth strategy in the region is temporarily stalled, joining thousands of international corporations, Chinese conglomerates and small businesses in the first wave of economic impact from the virus.
“Our priority is employees, and if the situation doesn’t correct itself quickly, we will probably remain closed for a while.” Levi Chief Financial Officer Harmit J Singh said in a phone interview.
International companies have poured into China, opening up Estée Lauder counters, Canada Goose stores and Rolls-Royce  showrooms in Beijing and Shanghai. In more recent years, they moved into the second- and third-tier cities whose populations have ballooned during the nation’s mass urbanization.
Companies with big exposure to China, from  Starbucks Corp  . to Tesla  Inc., refrained from predicting this week how the virus would affect demand, saying simply that they’d update their forecasts when they know more. Apple Inc . and  Microsoft Corp  . gave wider-than-usual forecast ranges for the quarter amid uncertainty about the virus impact.
The hope, of course, is that health officials are able to contain the spread of the virus enough to let people get back to the normal rhythms of life in a matter of weeks. A vaccine could be months or even years away, but some viruses can burn themselves out within the season. Others take longer. SARS was declared a global health emergency in March 2003 and was considered contained by that July.
The fear is that because 2019-nCoV has a stealthy quality -- symptoms can appear as late as two weeks after infection -- it will have staying power. Worst case, it could frustrate the best efforts of the world’s public health authorities and wreak havoc along trade routes and in boardrooms for months to come.
The first wave of economic impact from the virus comes at a delicate moment. Western companies have helped convert late January’s Lunar New Year festivities into a shopping bonanza, to the point where it’s become a key period for economic growth in China. This year, it’s been so subdued that consumption growth in the first quarter will slow by more than half in China from the 5.5% growth rate recorded in the final months of 2019, according to Bloomberg Economics.
It’s easy to see how. Starbucks has closed more than 2,000 outlets across China -- half of its total -- and can’t get some menu items for those that remain open. McDonald’s Corp. has shut hundreds of restaurants. Some Walmart  Inc. stores are running out of products. Walt  Disney   Co.’s theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have gone dark. Even before the U.S. and Japan advised their citizens to avoid traveling to China, airlines had curtailed flights to the country -- not because of fear of contagion, but due to lack of passengers.
Many of those coffee purchases, vacation getaways and impulse buys are lost forever, in terms of GDP -- it’s not as if consumers will buy two lattes in March to make up for the one they meant to purchase in January. Manufacturing is different. Although factories that were supposed to be reopening now will remain closed, many have some wiggle room to make up for lost time, pay employees some overtime and finish off their orders.
But with every passing day, there’s less room to maneuver. Construction activity that was paused over the winter, especially in the colder northern parts of China, should be starting up by now. Capital spending is likely to be reined in as companies delay decisions until they know more about the virus’s impact.
The many companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing need to place orders soon to have products ready for peak shopping times.
Take Anne Harper, founder of OMG Accessories, a New York-based company that sells bags and backpacks to Macy’s Inc.,  Nordstrom Inc  ., Dillard’s Inc., TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores Inc. Even before the Lunar New Year, she works to lock in orders with her supplier near Guangzhou to ensure she gets priority after the holiday. Customers want the product by May or June for back-to-school season, when some customers will sell 80,000 backpacks in a single week. That means OMG tries to fill its warehouse by April.
“Making those deliveries is just so important for the life cycle of our product,” Harper said. “If you miss delivery, everyone has already bought their school bags.”
The outbreak will also have a wide-ranging impact on the technology industry, with China accounting for about 21% of global IT hardware spending, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Jan. 29. Some of the biggest PC makers and parts suppliers are based in China, and if there’s a slowdown in sales, that would constrain demand for Microsoft’s Windows operating system software.
Apple, Tech
More than 50% of the more than $470 billion of chips that are sold each year are either used in devices sold in China or go there to be put into gear sold around the world.
Apple has roughly 10,000 direct employees in China, and its supply chain has a few million workers manufacturing products like the iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch. The Cupertino, California-based company prepares for extreme scenarios like the coronavirus by mandating that major components be dual-sourced -- both in terms of vendors and geography -- and a major immediate impact to its production plans is unlikely for now, a person familiar with its operations said this week. Even so, most of its assembly work is done in China, and so a shortage of workers for assembly lines will have a direct impact on shipment numbers.
On the other side of the equation are small manufacturers in China whose livelihood depends on the confidence of their customers. Any hesitance from clients can cause disarray for people like Cash Liu, a sales director at hot-tub maker Shenzhen Kingston Sanitary Ware.
“Some of our clients choose to wait and see and hold off from placing orders, due to concerns over the coronavirus,” Liu said via a messaging app. “Thus we are likely to miss the peak season of sales to Europe in March.”
Add up the effects of lower consumption, investment and a pause in manufacturing, and the impact from the virus could knock China’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth down to 4.5% -- the lowest since the quarterly data begins in 1992 -- from 6% in the final three months of 2019, estimated Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics. The biggest knock-on effects would be felt by Hong Kong, followed by South Korea and Japan, she wrote. Germany and Japan might take a 0.2% hit to GDP, while the U.S. and U.K. would absorb a 0.1% blow.
It’s survivable, and fiscal stimulus from Beijing could even lessen the blow. On the other hand, the estimate assumes the outbreak is contained to China. And “the longer factory output is affected, the bigger the risk China’s dominant position in global supply chains disrupts activity elsewhere,” the economist wrote.
Shell (LON:RDSa) Shock
Within and outside China’s borders, the virus is bringing up flashbacks to the height of last year’s trade war with the U.S., when global companies raced to find alternatives to their Chinese suppliers and avoid tariffs.
The outbreak could spur more businesses to move manufacturing to the U.S. and Mexico, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business this week. What’s clear is that the virus is adding another layer of complexity for businesses that were just beginning to breathe a sigh of relief over trade tensions.
“This virus outbreak may be even a bigger hit to us than the U.S.-China trade war,” said Melissa Shu, export manager at E.D. Opto Electrical Lighting Co.’s auto-parts factory in Zhenjiang City.
Decades of globalization have made leaders at large corporations comfortable with the logistical challenge of moving resources from place to place and responding nimbly to geopolitical shifts. But 2019 was a lot for anyone to handle, and the thought of contending with a potentially lethal virus in 2020 is giving even the most hardened executives pause.
“Between the virus and the tariffs and the protests in Hong Kong -- I’m waiting for the locusts,” said Emanuel Chirico, CEO of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH Corp . He said it’s too early to determine the impact the virus will have on the apparel industry."

PARIS (Reuters) - Payments company Worldline agreed on Monday to buy French rival  Ingenico   in a 7.8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) deal to create a new European leader in the sector and fend off cut-throat competition from internet and telecoms companies.
The purchase by Worldline, which was born out of French IT company Atos , is the latest deal in the payments sector, where the firms cater to everything from small shops needing card terminals to large online businesses. 
The increasing use of smartphones for online payments and the growing success of Apple Pay , Google Pay  and Amazon  has led to more competition, with mergers and acquisitions allowing firms to build scale and cut costs.
The global payments industry is set to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as more people switch from cash to digital payments for online and store purchases, according to research by consulting firm McKinsey.
In 2019,  Fiserv Inc   bought First Data Corp for $22 billion, while Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)  bought Worldpay for about $35 billion, consolidating their positions as the top two players globally.
The takeover of Ingenico gives the firm an implied equity value of 7.8 billion euros and would immediately boost Worldline s earnings per share, with around 250 million euros expected in savings by 2024.
The price tag implies a premium of about 16% to Ingenico s closing market value on Friday of around 6.7 billion euros.
The companies expect the transaction, which requires regulatory approval, to close in the third quarter of 2020. 
Ingenico shareholders would receive 11 Worldline shares and 160.5 euros in cash for seven Ingenico shares, in a primary tender offer. There would also be a secondary offer, with 56 Worldline shares exchanged for 29 Ingenico shares, translating into an offer price of 123.10 euros per Ingenico share.
INGENICO SHARES SURGE
Ingenico shares jumped 11.2% to 117 euros in early trading, while Worldline shares fell 4.2%, reflecting some concerns that Worldline is paying a hefty premium to buy Ingenico.
On closing the deal, former Worldline shareholders would own 65% of the combined entity and former Ingenico shareholders would own 35%. Worldline Chairman and CEO Gilles Grapinet would become CEO of the combined company and Ingenico Chairman Bernard Bourigeaud would become non-executive chairman.
Worldline, in which Atos still has a 16.9% equity stake, said the deal would give it access to Ingenico s strong presence in the travel, health and retail sectors, while the combined company would have a bigger geographic reach and an extended partnership with German savings banks.
Creating a European champion able to compete with bigger American rivals could also be welcomed by European politicians, with Europe s antitrust chief having voiced concerns over Apple Pay.
""The local tie up by Ingenico and Worldline makes sense so instead of competing with each other in their domestic space the combined company can focus on bigger fish to fry,"" said MB Capital managing director Marcus Bullus.
""I don t see there being any anti-trust issues in what should be quite a clean streamlined deal that will create added value for shareholders of the combined company,"" he added.
Atos welcomed the deal and said it could continue to sell down its stake in Worldline. Ingenico has long been seen as a target. Sources previously told Reuters that  Edenred   and French bank  Natixis   had both been at one point interested by Ingenico.

 Morgan Stanley   and Cardinal Partners were the financial advisers to Worldline, while Goldman Sachs Paris  and Rothschild  advised Ingenico."

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open a touch higher Monday, clawing back some of Friday’s hefty losses, but the deadly coronavirus in China remains a drag on sentiment as  earnings season continues.

At 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 17 points, or 0.5%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 100 up 53 points, or 0.6%, while the Dow Jones 30 futures contract rose 133 points, or 0.5%. 
On Friday, Wall Street closed sharply lower. The S&P dropped 1.8% to 3225.52,  its lowest level since October, while the Dow plunged 2.1% to 28,256.03, its largest drop in six months. The Nasdaq slid 1.6% to 9150.94, and is the only major index still on positive ground so far in 2020.

These losses could well prompt some bargain hunting Monday, but the news out of China remains grim. The death toll continued to climb, reaching 361 from 17,205 confirmed cases, while large parts of the Chinese industrial sector remain closed, and are likely to do so until Feb. 10 at the earliest.
Apple  said at the weekend it would also close its stores in China until at least Feb. 9 out of what it called ""an abundance of caution."" Apple gets some 20% of its iPhone sales out of China.

The financial markets on the Chinese mainland did reopen after the government-extended Lunar New Year holiday, but saw sharp losses with the blue-chip Shanghai Composite index closing almost 8% lower, a one-year low, and the yuan losing over 1% against the U.S. dollar.
The tech sector will be in focus Monday as Google parent Alphabet  is set to report after the close. This will be the company’s first time facing investors after it announced that Sundar Pichai would take over as CEO, after previously being in charge of just the Google section.
So far, there s no sign that spending on digital advertising is weakening. Analysts expect 19% growth in Google’s sales to $46.91 billion in the fourth-quarter when compared with the same period a year ago.
The earnings season has generally been a positive one for Wall Street this quarter. So far just under a half of the S&P 500 has reported, with 69% beating expectations and only 20% missing.
The economic data release of note Monday is the ISM manufacturing index at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), and is expected to see a small uptick in the wake of the phase 1 trade deal between the U.S. and China. This comes ahead of Friday’s key U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.

Crude oil is also in focus Monday amid reports that the major oil producers are considering deeper production cuts to combat the recent price slump.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+,  are considering a further cut in their oil output of 500,000 barrels per day, Reuters reported, citing sources. The group is considering holding a ministerial meeting on Feb. 14-15, Reuters said, earlier than the current schedule for a meeting in March.

Additionally the Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Saudi Arabia may temporarily cut its own output by 1 million barrels a day as a temporary and short-term measure. it cited OPEC officials.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwan s Wistron Corp plans to assemble printed circuit boards (PCBs) for iPhones at its new plant in southern India, two sources said, highlighting Apple  Inc s push to expand manufacturing in the world s second-biggest smartphone market.
The local assembly of PCBs by Wistron s India unit will be a first for the contract manufacturer, which began making Apple s low-priced SE model in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru in 2017. It currently assembles the 6S and 7 iPhone models there as well.
A PCB is a bed for key components such as processors, memory and wireless chip sets that are the heart of an electronic device. Once assembled, or populated with components, PCBs account for about half the cost of a smartphone.
Wistron s second iPhone plant, some 65 km (40 miles) from Bengaluru, is expected to become operational by April, the sources said, adding that it will make iPhone 7 and 8 models, some of which will be exported.
The facility will be capable of producing up to 8 million smartphones annually, they said.
The plan is part of Wistron s 30 billion rupee ($422.12 million) investment proposal submitted to the Karnataka state government in 2018.
Wistron s bigger rival Foxconn, which began making iPhone XR models in India last year, already assembles PCBs for those devices locally.
The deepening of PCB assembly in India will help Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple save on import taxes on smartphone components, levied by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government to boost local manufacturing and create new jobs.
On Saturday, India said in its federal budget that it will from April begin taxing imports of populated PCBs at a higher 20%, from the previous rate of 10%.
Apple declined to comment. Wistron did not respond to a request for comment. 
Apple, which still makes most of its iPhones in China, has gradually moved to expand production in other countries as Washington and Beijing wage a disruptive battle over trade and technology.
In India, a market with 1.1 billion wireless connections and about 480 million smartphones, Apple s premium devices have proven too costly for many consumers. The company s market share by shipment volumes is just over 1%, though it was among the fastest growing smartphone brands in India in the quarter to Dec. 2019, according to market researcher Counterpoint.
India remains largely dependent on China for supplies of smartphone parts such as cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards.
The coronavirus outbreak in China could cause a delay in Wistron and Apple s plans for India, one of the sources said. 
The epidemic, which has killed more than 250 so far, threatens to disrupt India s production of smartphones if it continues to spread, Reuters reported previously.

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks bounced sharply at the opening on Monday as a measure of confidence returned to markets in the absence of game-changing news regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.

Markets that had had their worst week in months opened as much as 0.7% higher, not least on the back of reports that products from U.S. pharma giants Gilead  and AbbVie  had had encouraging results in treating the disease.

Gilead) stock rose 4.3%, while AbbVie  stock rose 1.5%.

By 10:23 AM ET (1523 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 325 points, or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%.

The overall tone was helped by the Institute of Supply Management’s monthly business survey, where the main index showed activity rising to 50.9, its highest since August. Other purchasing manager indices published in China and Europe had shown a weaker picture. The eurozone manufacturing PMI was still below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction despite hitting an 11-month high of 47.9.

Airline stocks recovered a little of their poise after spreading bans on flights into and out of China undermined the outlook for the current year. American Airlines , Delta Airlines  and United Airlines  were all between 2.5% and 3.0% higher.

The biggest gainer, however, was   Nike    stock. The sportswear giant rose 4.1% after UBS and JPMorgan  both upgraded it, the latter putting it on its “analyst focus list”, saying that last week’s selloff had created a rare buying opportunity.

Nike is exposed to any short-term weakness in the economy because it gets around 16% of its sales from China and sources nearly one-third of its shoes and other sports gear there.
Another stock exposed to China fared less well. Apple  opened lower but turned around to be 1.0% higher, despite saying it would keep its Chinese stores and corporate offices closed for another week after the end of the Lunar New Year holidays.
However, oil and gas stocks continued to underperform as U.S. crude futures market shrugged off reports of deeper production cuts by OPEC and its allies. The global benchmark Brent fell 1.3% to $55.89 a barrel. "

Investing.com – Here are three things that cold rock markets tomorrow.
1.  Disney  Reports; Market Anxious for China Update
Dow component Walt  Disney   will report earnings after the bell tomorrow.
The company is expected to report a profit of $1.46 per share on revenue of about $20.8 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
All things being equal, investors woul probably be most interested in more updates and numbers from the Disney+ streaming service as it takes on Netflix , Apple  and others in the hot space.
But what the company has to say about any impact it’s seeing and expects from the coronavirus could take the spotlight.
Disney temporarily shut down its amusement parks in China – Shanghai Disneyland and Disneytown --  to limit the spread of the disease.
Last week, Needham lowered its quarterly estimates for the company, citing lower political advertising demand at broadcasting and lower box office (offset by lower marketing spending).
Before the bell, ConocoPhillips  will issue its numbers.
Analysts are looking for earnings of 80 cents per share and revenue of about $8.2 billion.
Energy shares were hammered last week on earnings, particularly ExxonMobil , and the landscape is looking grim at the moment, with oil prices pressured by worries of Chinese demand slumping on the virus impact.
2. Factory Orders, API Inventories on Tap
The economic calendar is fairly light tomorrow.
At 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT), the Commerce Department will release the latest figures on factory orders.
December factory orders are expected to have risen 1.2%, reversing the drop of 0.7% in November.
For energy traders, the American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of weekly U.S. oil inventories.
The API snapshot serves as a guide for the official figures out Wednesday, but the two sets of numbers often diverge.
Last week API reported a drawdown of about 4.3 million barrels in crude stockpiles.
Oil entered a bear market today, down 20% from recent highs, and WTI and Brent fell below important technical levels.
3. First Voting Round for Democrats
Investors will also have politics to contend with tomorrow, with the results of the Iowa Caucuses come out tonight, the first hurdle for Democratic presidential nominee hopefuls.
If candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders do well, that could weigh on equities. Both have platforms that Wall Street sees as unfriendly, to say the least.
The caucus voting in Iowa starts at 7:00 PM ET (00:00 GMT)."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Justice Department officials will meet on Tuesday with representatives of state attorneys general to discuss their investigations of search and advertising giant Google , according to sources familiar with the plans.
The meeting is in the afternoon, according to one source, and will include officials from six or seven states, including Texas, according to a second source familiar with the matter.
The Justice Department and nearly all state attorneys general have opened investigations into allegations that Alphabet s Google has broken antitrust law. The probes focus on search bias, advertising and management of Google s Android operating system.
Google, Facebook , Amazon  and Apple  are all the focus of federal, state and congressional investigations following complaints that the four tech giants abused their clout in dealings with smaller companies.
The probes are being carried out by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee. U.S. Attorney General William Barr has said he would like to see them wrapped up this year.

The companies have come under fire from all parts of the political spectrum, with President Donald Trump critical of the companies and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders calling for the break-up of Amazon and Facebook. "

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has agreed to allow U.S. health experts into the country as part of a World Health Organization (WHO) effort to help fight the fast-spreading coronavirus, as the number of cases and deaths continued to mount.
In central China s Hubei province, epicenter of the epidemic, China state TV reported there were 2,345 new cases of the virus and another 64 deaths, bringing the total of virus-related fatalities in Hubei to 414 by Monday.
The Chinese stock market plunged about 8% on Monday, wiping $393 billion off the value of the Shanghai bourse, on the first day of trading following an extended Lunar New Year holiday in a bid to help keep people at home and contain the virus  spread.
The White House said on Monday China had accepted its offer to have U.S. experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus that emerged in Hubei s provincial capital of Wuhan.
A 1,000-bed hospital built in eight days to treat people with the virus in Wuhan was due to receive its first patients on Monday, state media said. A second hospital with 1,600 beds is due to be operational later this week.
With Wuhan and some other Chinese cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing. Sources at the OPEC oil cartel told Reuters producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices.
The WHO last week declared the flu-like virus a global emergency. It has spread to 23 other countries and regions. The Philippines reported the first coronavirus death outside of China.
Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates.
Earlier on Monday, China accused the United States of spreading fear by pulling its citizens out and severely restricting travel.
Washington has ""unceasingly manufactured and spread panic,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, noting that the WHO had advised against trade and travel curbs.
""It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations,"" she said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defended the measures taken by the United States, including suspending the entry of foreign nationals who had visited China within the past 14 days.
""We made an aggressive decision in front of an unprecedented threat that action now had the biggest potential to slow this thing down. That s what the theory is here,"" said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, as she noted that there are already some 17,000 cases of a virus for which the population does not have immunity.
 NO REASON  FOR TRAVEL CURBS
The WHO s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, again said travel bans were unnecessary.
""There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,"" he told the WHO s executive board in Geneva.
""The chance of getting this (virus) going to anywhere outside China is very low, and even in China when you go to other provinces, it s very low,"" he added.
The outbreak is reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a virus from the same family that emerged in China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world out of the roughly 8,000 who were infected.
Chinese data suggests the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. Prior to the latest figures from Hubei, the number of confirmed infections in China stood at 17,205.
The WHO said at least 151 cases had been confirmed in 23 other countries and regions, including Japan, Thailand, Germany, Britain and the United States, which on Monday reported its second case of person-to-person transmission within its borders. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping said controlling the virus was his country s most important task, Xinhua state news agency said.
In addition to Monday s Chinese stock selloff, the yuan currency had its worst day since August, and Shanghai-traded commodities from oil to copper hit their lower limits - all despite the central bank s injection of 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) into money markets.
The selloff did not extend to U.S. markets, which closed higher on Monday with the S&P 500 up 0.7%.
Fears over the effect of China s lockdown on global growth have slashed more than 22% off the price of the Brent global crude oil benchmark since its recent peak on Jan. 8.. 
Economists are predicting world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point.
 YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED 
Taiwan s Foxconn, which makes smartphones for Apple  and other brands, has halted ""almost all"" of its production in China after companies were told to shut until at least Feb. 10, a source said. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Countries continued to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. 
The United States, which flew nearly 200 people out last week, is planning ""a handful more flights."" Russia was due to start evacuating its citizens on Monday, and Canada said 304 of its citizens were seeking to be flown out. 
Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, rocked by months of anti-China protests, announced the closure of four more border crossings with mainland China, leaving just three open.
China s efforts to contain the virus have taken some unexpected, and some might say unnerving, forms.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc s  new Chief Executive Sundar Pichai unveiled sales figures that investors have long demanded, but shares fell 5% as Google s advertising business and the new data about YouTube and Google Cloud broadly disappointed.
Pichai had sought to counter slowing revenue growth in the company s main advertising business by pointing to the Silicon Valley firm s younger units.
But Pichai s reveal that Google s YouTube video streaming unit is generating ad revenue at a pace of $15 billion annually put it below rough estimates as high as $25 billion. 
Divulging 53% quarterly revenue growth for Google s cloud services compared with a year ago meant it grew slower than the business it is trying to catch up to, Microsoft Corp s  Azure. It reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales last week, or 39% when considering some cloud services Microsoft sells through other units. 
While financial analysts applauded the new transparency from Alphabet, some questioned executives for the second time in the last four quarters to explain why overall revenue has been missing or just barely meeting their expectations. Sales growth dipped below 20% in three quarters during 2019, compared to just once in the previous three years.
Alphabet has blamed currency exchange rates and its constant tweaking of features, saying that it is not focused on quarterly marks. 
""We continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience,"" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat responded to an analyst. ""But there will be variability over time because we re very focused on what s in the right long-term interest.""
Shares of the company fell about 4.5% in extended trading to $1,416.
""The stock was priced for perfection, and a top-line miss was enough to send it lower,"" said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""YouTube was impressive at $15 billion for the year, Cloud less so at $8.9 billion.""
Other financial analysts said YouTube s ad revenue was underwhelming too. 
""YouTube is smaller than generally assumed, but on the flipside, search seems to have accelerated and is growing faster than feared,"" said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.
Google through its namesake search engine as well as properties such as YouTube has been the web s biggest draw for advertisers for a decade, enabling it last month to become the fourth listed company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization.
But new concerns have emerged among investors about whether its dominance will last as U.S. antitrust regulators investigate Google and as Amazon  and  Facebook Inc   continue to grow their ads businesses globally. Both beat analysts  expectations last week.
Alphabet s overall sales in the fourth quarter were $46.08 billion, up 17%, compared with an average estimate of $46.94 billion among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv. 
Google ad sales in the holiday shopping quarter were $37.93 billion, up 16.7% from the same period last year
Alphabet s expenses have ballooned with hiring of thousands of salespeople, building of new data centers and marketing the Google brand through hardware and other ventures. 
For the fourth quarter, Alphabet s total costs and expenses rose 18.5% from a year ago to $36.809 billion. 
Porat said hiring and infrastructure spending would accelerate in 2020. 
Alphabet s fourth-quarter profit was $10.67 billion, or $15.35 per share, compared with the analysts  average estimate of $8.787 billion, or $12.53 per share. 
Hardware sales fell in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, Porat said. Results could suffer further from any protracted work stoppages in Asia as companies combat the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, she said.
Google last week temporarily shut down all its offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan due to the coronavirus. It has thousands of engineers across the region, including a hardware engineering center in Taiwan.

YOUTUBE PREMIERE
In December, Google CEO Pichai gained the additional role of Alphabet CEO from Larry Page as he and fellow co-founder Sergey Brin stepped back even further from day-to-day management.
The new YouTube disclosures under Pichai showed ad revenue grew 31% compared with last year. 
Pichai also said YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users, generated about $750 million in subscription and other non-advertising revenue, but did not reveal a figure for the year-earlier period. 
Pichai said YouTube had 20 million paid subscribers between YouTube s Music and Premium ad-free viewing packages, and separately had 2 million paid subscribers for YouTube TV, which competes with Dish Network Corp s  Sling TV and Walt  Disney  Co s  Hulu to stream television online.
Amazon recently said it has 55 million music subscribers, while Apple Inc  last year announced 60 million such subscribers. Sling had about 2.7 million subscribers as of last year, in line with estimates for Hulu.

Shares of Alphabet were up 28.1% in the last 12 months entering Monday, compared with 21.8% for Facebook shares, 23.5% for Amazon, 68.1% for Microsoft and 88.7% for Apple Inc . "

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp (T:6758) raised its annual profit outlook on strong sales of smartphone image sensors after reporting a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly profit, but it warned of an impact from the Wuhan coronavirus on its global supply chain. 
Demand for image sensors has been strong enough that even with its plants operating at full capacity Sony has been unable to pile up planned inventories, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said at an earnings briefing on Tuesday. 
But he said sensor shipments could be disrupted if the spread of the coronavirus forces client smartphone makers to suspend their assembly plants in China for a prolonged period. 
The virus outbreak could also rattle supply chains for its PlayStation gaming hardware and other consumer electronics, he said. 
""We can t deny the possibility of the virus threat expanding to a scale large enough to wipe out our latest upward earnings revision,"" Totoki said. 
The Japanese entertainment and electronics firm raised its annual operating profit forecast by 5% to 880 billion yen ($8.1 billion), roughly in line with the 878.47 billion yen consensus of 22 analysts compiled by Refinitiv. 
For the October-December quarter, profit dropped 20% to 300.1 billion yen, still beating the 271.07 billion yen average analyst estimate. Excluding an accounting gain linked to the acquisition of music publisher EMI and that boosted profit a year earlier, the latest quarter marked a profit increase. 
Sony s sensor business continued to thrive as smartphone makers compete to adopt larger image sensors and multiple lenses on embedded cameras for improved picture quality, driving quarterly profit at the business by 62% to 75.2 billion yen. 
The Japanese firm controls about a half of the world s image sensor market, supplying most global smartphone makers including Apple Inc  and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
To reduce dependence on smartphones, Sony has been working on sensors for automotive applications.
Meanwhile, Sony s gaming business saw profit fall 27% to 53.5 billion yen as sales of its six-year-old PlayStation 4 console continued to decline.
The firm has said the PlayStation 5, scheduled for release this year, will feature better graphics, advanced haptic controllers and other improvements. 

Sony s share price has shot up more than 40% over the past year to its highest in nearly two decades - a vote of confidence for Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida s ability to retain momentum after a corporate turnaround led by his predecessor."

Several car giants including Ford, Nissan and Honda Motor have already suspended some plants within China this week in line with Beijing s guidelines.
But now Hyundai has announced plans to gradually suspend its South Korean factories too starting on Tuesday. 
The virus outbreak in China has disrupted supplies of a vehicle component, and factories will be fully idled from February 7 to around February 10, a union official said. 
The factory suspension has been discussed since Monday due to a shortage of auto parts called wiring harnesses, auto industry officials told Reuters.
One analyst said quote ""Hyundai and Kia may be more affected"" (than their rivals) as they tend to import more parts from China.
South Korea imported over one and a half billion dollars worth of auto parts from China in 2019.
The virus is having a major impact on other sectors too:  
Apple  delayed reopening some suppliers  factories outside Wuhan to mid February. 
And clothing brands H&M and Levi said they have already shut stores which has hurt sales.   "

As a result, Sony s operating profit topped 300 billion yen - or about 2.76 billion dollars.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn could see a ""big"" production impact and shipments to customers including Apple face disruption if a Chinese factory halt due to the coronavirus outbreak extends into a second week, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Taiwan s Foxconn (TW:2317), which makes smartphones for Apple  and other brands, has halted ""almost all"" of its production in China after companies were told to shut until at least Feb. 10, the source said, adding that an extension of the stoppage could disrupt shipments to clients including Apple. 
Taipei-based Foxconn, which is the world s largest contract electronics maker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Apple declined to comment.
The source told Reuters on Monday that Foxconn has so far seen a ""fairly small impact"" from the outbreak as it was utilizing factories in countries including Vietnam, India and Mexico to fill the gap, adding that the company will be able to make up for the delay if factories work overtime after the ban.
In Eastern China s Suzhou, one of its largest manufacturing hubs, companies have been told to stay shut until at least Feb. 8 and in Shanghai until Feb. 9. Factories in the southern manufacturing hub of Dongguan in export-oriented Guangdong province have also been told not to open before Feb. 10.
The outbreak of coronavirus, which the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, threatens to disrupt swathes of Chinese manufacturing.
The source said a halt beyond Feb. 10 could disrupt Foxconn s shipments, highlighting concerns about production hubs in the southern province of Guangdong and the city of Zhengzhou in Henan province where key iPhone plants are located.
""What we are worried about is delays for another week or even another month. The impact would be big,"" the source said. ""It definitely will have an impact on the Apple production line.""
""The tricky question is whether we will be able to resume production (on Feb. 10)...It s up to the instructions given by central and provincial governments.""
The Guangdong Department of Labour and Social Security said in a response to a question from Reuters that no company including Foxconn can resume work before Feb. 9, with the exception of firms involved in making or providing medical supplies and other daily necessities.
HEALTH CONTROL 
Foxconn has asked employees and clients in China s Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, not to return to factories and told workers to report their health condition to managers on a daily basis, an internal memo reviewed by Reuters shows. 
The company also said employees who follow the rules will be paid as usual and those we fail to do so will be ""severely"" punished, although it did not elaborate.
A hotline was set up to encourage employees to report those who had broken the rules, with a monetary award of 200 yuan ($29), the note dated Feb. 1 said.
Morningstar analyst Don Yew sees ""limited"" impact on Foxconn s supply chain, saying its four subsidiaries in Hubei only accounted for 1.8% of the firm s overall revenue in 2018 and vendors such as Apple maintain a diversified supply chain.

However, a spread of the coronavirus to major smartphone manufacturing hubs such as Guangdong may lead them to revise financial estimates for companies including Foxconn, Yew said. "

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai over the last three years has touted the business prospects of what he has called ""three of our biggest bets: YouTube, cloud and hardware.""
On Monday, it appeared the first two bets are outperforming the third.
Google parent Alphabet Inc  separately listed YouTube and cloud revenue on its quarterly financial statements for the first time. But it gave no specifics on hardware beyond that sales declined, compared to a year ago, during a holiday period in which consumer electronics are a common gift.
Pichai, who gained the additional role of Alphabet CEO in December, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat did not specify a cause for the downturn. A Google spokeswoman did not respond to a request to comment.
But the popularity of Google s more affordable smartphone and flattening demand for its speakers with voice assistant technology are two visible factors.
The executives described hardware as a continued investment focus, and to be sure, that business in its current form is just three years old compared with about nine for cloud and 15 for YouTube.
""Hardware is still in the early stages of delivering on our vision for ambient computing,"" Pichai said on Monday.
Porat called hardware a ""multi-billion dollar business,"" equivalent to at least $500 million a quarter.
YouTube revenue from ads and subscriptions rose from a year ago to $5.5 billion during the fourth quarter. Cloud computing quarterly sales were $2.6 billion, up 53%.
HEAVY COMPETITION
Early last year, Porat said Google s Pixel 3 faced fierce competition from rival high-priced smartphones, which could include Apple Inc s  iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co s (KS:005930) Galaxy S series.
Google then released a device half the cost, the $399 Pixel 3a. It has sold well, according to analysts and the company, but has meant some consumers are spending less with Google.
The Pixel 3a boosted Google’s smartphone sales to 4.1 million units in the first half of 2019, nearly as much as it moved in all of 2018, according to estimates from research company IDC.
The Pixel 4, released last fall, has fared worse. Retailers in January discounted it by more than $200, steeper than price cuts a year ago for the Pixel 3.
About 2.7 million out of 375 million phones shipped during the fourth quarter globally were a Pixel variety, a ""disappointing"" performance, according to tracker Strategy Analytics.
Last May, Google rebranded several of its speaker products from Google Home to Google Next.
Demand for those devices also slipped. Google s market share fell through the first three quarters of 2019 as it shipped about 11.3 million speakers compared with 14.5 million units over the same period in 2019, according to market researcher Canalys.
Amazon.com Inc s  Echo gadgets gained in market share amid heavy television marketing. Other consumers continue to have privacy concerns about inviting into their homes speakers that can have internet-connected cameras and microphones.
Provisional data from Strategy Analytics across all of 2019 shows Google speaker shipments up 35%, boosted by fourth-quarter giveaway deals via partnerships with Spotify  and others.
Pichai told financial analysts on Monday that the company s Nest Mini and Nest Hub Max sold well over the holidays. But a year ago, he described 2018 as a record for Google speakers, ""with millions sold"" over the holidays.
Google hopes to boost its hardware business with the acquisition of fitness tracker and smartwatch maker  Fitbit Inc  , pending approval from antitrust regulators. Porat in a call with reporters on Monday said Google is still hoping to the close the transaction this year."

The CEO of Mobicip, an app with nearly a million global users that allows parents to control what kids can access on an iPhone, told Reuters he was interviewed by a U.S. investigator in November.
And he s not alone.  A handful of app developers have been contacted by the DOJ, a source familiar with the probe revealed.  This provides a clue of which direction the investigation is going.
When it comes to claims of anti-competitive behavior at Apple:  Mobicip says it was kicked out of the Apple store about six months after Apple introduced its Screen Time app, six months later when it was reinstated, demand for the Mobicip app had been cut in half.
Executives at six other parental control apps told Reuters a similar story, their apps were working fine in the Apple app store, until Apple launched its own version of parental control.
Apple didn t want to comment but pointed Reuters to statement on its website that says the app store was designed to hold apps ""to a high standard for privacy, security and content.""
Apple is one of four big tech companies currently under scrutiny by America s top prosecutor for allegedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has reached out to app developers as part of its investigation into Apple Inc , one of the four big tech companies being probed for alleged anti-competitive behavior, according one of the developers and another person familiar with the investigation. 
The chief executive of developer Mobicip, Suren Ramasubbu, told Reuters he was interviewed in November by a U.S. investigator who asked about the company s interactions with Apple. The app, which has nearly a million users worldwide, allows parents to control what their children see on their iPhones. 
Ramasubbu said the Mobicip app was temporarily removed from the iPhone app store last year for a failure to meet requirements imposed by Apple. 
A source familiar with the Justice Department s investigation said a handful of app developers had been contacted in what is the first indication of what officials are pursuing involving Apple since the investigation was revealed by Reuters in June. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Apple s Silicon Valley neighbors for other reasons, calling for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google and accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in December that he hoped to have the Justice Department investigations into the big tech platforms -  Facebook Inc  , Alphabet Inc s  Google, Amazon.com Inc  and Apple - wrapped up this year.
Apple declined comment, but pointed to a statement on its website that says its app store was designed to hold apps ""to a high standard for privacy, security and content.""
""Since 2016, we have removed over 1.4 million apps from the App Store because they have not been updated or don’t work on our most current operating systems,"" the site says. 
Apple s ability to do just that has been a point of contention in the courtroom. The company was accused in lawsuits last year of abusing its clout in the app market. In one case, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the go-ahead last May to an antitrust lawsuit that accused Apple of forcing consumers to overpay for iPhone software applications. 
SCREEN TIME CONTROL 
Apple introduced its Screen Time app, which includes parental controls, in June 2018. At the start of 2019, Ramasubbu told Reuters, his company was contacted by Apple and warned that Mobicip s app violated the iPhone-maker s rules relating to technical elements that had previously been acceptable. 
The app was removed from the app store for about six months, during which time it was updated to be compliant with Apple rules, Ramasubbu said. It was reinstated in October 2019, but he estimates his company s business has shrunk by half.
Six executives of parental control app companies interviewed by Reuters said they had a comfortable relationship with Apple until mid-2018. That is when Apple introduced its own, similar software giving parents oversight of their children s phone screen time and searches. 
Apple has said that it had been concerned about parental control apps using technology which gave developers access to sensitive data, and that they declined to approve apps that used the technology if they did not also commit to not sharing data on children.
As the arbiter of who is allowed to sell in the app store, Apple says it has the power to ensure that only the highest quality apps are sold there. 

But some developers say it also allows Apple to push out apps that compete with its own products, thus strengthening its profits at a time with its device sales have stagnated and it is seeking new sources of revenue."

Ten people on a cruise ship moored near Yokohama with about 3,700 crew and passengers aboard have tested positive for the new coronavirus and taken to hospital, Japan’s Health Ministry announced Wednesday.
The Diamond Princess was placed under quarantine this week before it reached Japan and checks were conducted after a passenger from Hong Kong who had been on the ship tested positive for the virus. Of 31 people whose test results have come through, 10 were confirmed as infected, the ministry said.
The new infections come in addition to 23 people already confirmed to have contracted the disease in Japan.

Gilead is shipping enough doses of its experimental coronavirus drug to treat 500 patients in China and is ramping up supply in case clinical trials work.
Remdesivir, an antiviral treatment that shows effectiveness in the lab against coronaviruses, is being tested in two trials in China in patients with moderate and severe symptoms of the novel pathogen, said Merdad Parsey, Gilead’s chief medical officer.
Patients will get 10 once-daily infusions of the experimental drug or a placebo and be evaluated after 28 days to see whether the drug helped.
Gilead is donating about 500 patients’ worth of the experimental drug, and Chinese hospitals will be in charge of conducting the tests.
SEC Warns About Virus Investment Scams (1:44 p.m. NY)
At least one group appears to be benefiting from the coronavirus: financial fraudsters.
That’s according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is warning investors to be on the lookout for scams tied to the virus’s spread. The regulator said in a Tuesday statement that it’s become aware of a number of online promotions, including some on social media, that aim to attract investments in companies on the false premise that they can prevent, detect or cure infections.
“We urge investors to be wary of these promotions, and to be aware of the substantial potential for fraud at this time,” the SEC said.
WHO Says 684 People Have Recovered From Coronavirus (12:21 p.m. NY)
Six hundred eighty-four people have recovered from coronavirus infections, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist serving on the World Health Organization’s emergency committee. The death toll has climbed to at least 425, the group said Tuesday.
The UN agency plans to hold a research meeting on the virus next week, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in Geneva. The outbreak was declared an international public health emergency by the WHO last week.

Virus to Delay U.S. Export Boom to China, Kudlow Says (9:32 a.m. NY)
The “export boom” from the U.S.’s trade deal with China will be delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak, but the economic impact “is going to be minimal,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said.
“It’s not a catastrophe, it’s not a disaster -- we’ve been through this before. I think the impact is going to be minimal,” Kudlow said on Fox Business Tuesday. “It’s going to be much tougher for China.”"

Hon Hai, which makes the vast majority of the world’s iPhones from the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, is now projecting a sales increase of 1% to 3% this year, Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News in a text message. That’s down from a Jan. 22 forecast of 3% to 5%, before the epidemic spread around the globe, and lags the 5.4% average of analysts’ projections.
The contagion is expected to disrupt Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China, while also dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth. Hon Hai, an important manufacturer also for major brands from HP Inc . to Sony Corp (T:6758)., said Tuesday it still expects to be able to restart facilities throughout China on schedule, according to a text message sent to Bloomberg News. Suppliers such as Quanta Computer Inc., Inventec Corp. and LG Display Co. also said they would go back to work next week in China.

But while Chinese officials and companies have targeted Feb. 10 as the date to resume work in much of the country, doubts about the timing have grown in recent days as the virus death toll rises, workers find themselves stuck in municipal lockdowns and the transport of people and goods has been hampered.
”Given current market conditions, we are lowering to 1%-3%,” Liu replied when asked about whether Hon Hai will cut its original sales growth forecast for this year.
Hon Hai’s shares stood largely unchanged Wednesday after having slid about 11% since a broader Asian market selloff began in mid-January.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai’s lower 2020 sales growth outlook of 1-3% vs. 3-5% just a week ago likely reflects the severity of disruption to its operations from the coronavirus outbreak, in our view. The NT$111 billion reduction in sales at the midpoint of the range vs. the prior midpoint is equivalent to one week of revenue, accounting for the extended factory shutdown imposed by the Chinese government.

Apple in January issued a wider-than-usual sales forecast to reflect what Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called “uncertainty” caused by a virus outbreak in one of its most important markets.
Smartphone sales -- particularly in China -- are expected to take a big hit from the coronavirus outbreak after government-imposed containment measures snarled logistics and emptied out stores. Hon Hai’s Hong Kong-listed unit FIH Mobile Ltd. makes phones for Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co.
Research firms vary in their estimates of how big the shipments drop-off will be, reflecting the still-developing nature of the virus outbreak -- but they agree it will hurt. Strategy Analytics forecasts a 32% decline in Chinese shipments in the first quarter, to 60 million from roughly 89 million shipments a year earlier. Canalys, starting from a similar estimate for 2019, scythes its expectations down to 42.5 million shipments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - State attorneys general investigating Alphabet Inc s Google unit  met on Tuesday with U.S. Justice Department officials to coordinate efforts to probe the search and advertising giant, officials told Reuters.
The attorneys general of Texas, Utah and Nebraska were among those in attendance. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said one goal of the gathering was to coordinate efforts, with the goal of wrapping up the probe by the end of the year.
""We re working well together and trying to make sure that there aren t redundancies,"" told Reuters outside the Justice Department. ""We re hoping to go as quickly as we possible can but I don t have a specific timetable.""
The department said in late July it was opening a broad antitrust investigation of the big digital firms - Google, Amazon.com Inc , Apple Inc  and  Facebook Inc  . Attorney General Bill Barr has since said he would like the probe completed by the end of the year.
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the companies and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for the break-up of Amazon and Facebook.
The Justice Department said in a statement that the state officials met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, Associate Deputy Attorney General Ryan Shores and officials from the department s Antitrust Division.
The Justice Department said in a statement the meeting was ""to continue strengthening their multilateral antitrust law enforcement cooperation concerning technology markets.""
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told reporters, ""It s nice to have the cooperation of the Department of Justice."" 
The Justice Department and nearly all state attorneys general have opened investigations into allegations that Google has broken antitrust law. The federal probe focuses on search bias, advertising and management of Google s Android operating system.
Also on Tuesday, the Justice Department said the head of the Justice Department s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has been recused from the Google portion of the agency s review of big technology platforms due to potential conflicts of interest.
One or more of the companies are also being looked at by the Federal Trade Commission, a second group of state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee.

PETAH TIKVA, Israel(Reuters) -  Intel Corp   is investing heavily in ""smart buildings"" in Israel that will be full of perks to keep employees happy, helping the U.S. chipmaker compete for the country s top professionals. 
Intel, one of the biggest employers and exporters in Israel, plans to invest $11 billion to build a manufacturing facility in the country, where some of its most advanced technologies have been hatched. 
Home to more startups per capita than any other nation thanks to its advanced military and government support, Israel is suffering from a shortage of talent. 
While multinationals like Intel, Apple  and Google  have snapped up local startups and set up research centers, competition is making it tough to find skilled workers. 
Tech companies in Israel were unable to fill about 17,000 positions in 2018, according to Start-Up National Central, a nonprofit research organization, and that figure continues to climb. 
To address this gap and lure talent, Intel has upped the ante at its new development center in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva. Replete with environmentally friendly systems, a smart gym, massage parlor, the structure also has 14,000 sensors that monitor motion, light and air to make sure workers are comfortable. 
If these efforts give Intel an edge in hiring, rival companies are expected to follow suit. 
""Anything you offer as a perk, whether it s a gym membership or a paperless work environment or additional days for maternity leave or a go-green policy, all of these things are going to help you,"" said David Gantshar, chief executive of California-based Shepherd Search Group. 
Intel s box-shaped, 10-story building is covered in glass and will accommodate up to 2,700 of its local 13,000 workforce. 
The company declined to comment on how much it spent on the development center. Israeli media reported a cost of 650 million shekels ($188 million). 
David Hareli, deputy CEO of  Afcon Holdings  , which constructed the building, said it was a challenge to finish the project within Intel s three-year timetable. 
Originally designed to be seven stories high, Intel asked to add three floors. Once the contract was signed, Intel asked for LEED Platinum certification, the highest standard of green construction, rather than the lesser gold level. 
This required a double-skin facade to improve ventilation and prevent the building from heating up under the strong Middle Eastern sun. 
Architect Dagan Mochli, who designed the building, said he was working on a new development center for Intel in the northern city of Haifa that will also be smart and LEED Platinum. 
He called Intel s building a ""breakthrough,"" with demand growing among clients for similar structures. He is planning a smart 15,000-square-meter banking campus in Israel as well as a 240,000-square-meter smart biotech park in China.
SMART TRAVEL 
The building has an open-space format. An atrium in the center is roofed by skylights, and caps the five top floors. Health-conscious employees often use the internal stairs in the atrium instead of the elevator. 
For those seeking seclusion, there are small soundproof rooms and noise-insulated armchairs near the windows. 
The 14,000 sensors - twice the number found in similar buildings, according to company officials - detect when someone enters a room and adjust the lighting and air conditioning. 
For example, when carbon dioxide levels rise, fresh air is introduced to keep people energetic.
The sensors and corresponding app can also help employees find the best way to travel to and from work and let them know which of the building s three restaurants has room during lunch. The app lets workers alert other staff as to their whereabouts. 
Not everybody was excited about the new workspace. Some employees anonymously complained on an Israeli news website about a lack of privacy. 
Intel Israel CEO Yaniv Garty said the tracking and collection of data is on an opt-in basis. 
""We don t ask people to clock in or clock out. We believe in a relationship which is based on output,"" Garty said. 
Ido Melamed, a hardware engineer who has worked at Intel for 16 years, moved to the new building from an office with cubicles. He said the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. 
""We see each other, we can talk more openly and collaborate more effectively,"" Melamed said. ""There is real trust between the company and employees that the data (collected) is used for the right purposes.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan s Foxconn (TW:2317) aims to gradually restart operations at factories in China next week but it could take one to two weeks from then to resume full production due to the coronavirus outbreak, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Taiwan s Foxconn, which makes smartphones for global vendors including Apple , has filed requests to reopen factories with Chinese authorities, the source said, adding that a full resumption was not possible until late February due to various travel restrictions imposed to curb the virus. 
A delay in the resumption of operations could have an impact on the global technology supply chain and shipments to Foxconn s customers, including Apple.
""Roads are closed in some parts of the country. Nobody knows for sure if some workers could get back in time,"" said the source, who described a ""chaotic"" situation in the company s top management as it scrambles to meet different requirements for the resumption of operations set by various local governments across China.
""A full resumption will take at least one to two weeks from Feb. 10.""
In some cities, authorities are asking companies to put workers returning from other provinces under a three-day quarantine, which was a challenge for big companies like Foxconn, the source said.
""How is it possible to quarantine tens of thousands of people in one neighborhood for three days?"" the person said. 
The factory halt is set to hit Foxconn s profit for 2020 but it was still evaluating the likely impact, the person said.
""Profit is definitely going to be hit, but as to how big the impact will be, we re still calculating,"" the person said. 
Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The outbreak of the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, threatens to disrupt swathes of Chinese manufacturing and will force policymakers to ready measures to stabilize the economy.
Companies in China, closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, were told to stay shut for an extra week, until as late as Feb. 10, including those in the southern manufacturing hub of Dongguan in export-oriented Guangdong province, where some iPhone plants are located. 
Foxconn, the world s largest contract electronics manufacturer, was making plans to ensure the health and safety of its hundreds of thousands of workers, including scanning a QR code on employees  mobile phones for health screening. 
The company will use local workers as much as possible while allowing time off for those who can not travel long distances to get back to work, according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters. 
Foxconn s factories are dependent to a great extent on migrant workers from poorer regions.
""We will be very glad if the return rate could hit 30% (on Feb. 10),"" the source said. 

Shares of Foxconn, formally known as  Hon Hai , have dropped more than 10% since the market (TWII) reopened last week following the Lunar New Year holiday."

Investing.com -- Stock markets jump on tentative reports of progress in developing drugs to fight the coronavirus, whose impact continues to reverberate as Apple  supplier Hon Hai warns of a hit to production. Pete Buttigeig wins in Iowa while President Trump and Speaker Pelosi trade insults at the State of the Union speech. The ADP  payrolls report for January is due, along with the ISM s non-manufacturing survey. And NYSE owner ICE  confirms it looked at a bid for eBay , while General Motors  and Qualcomm  head another long list of earnings Wednesday. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 5th February.
1. Coronavirus toll nears 500; markets grasp at news of drug progress
The death toll from the coronavirus reached 493, another rise of over 16% on the previous day, but more than twice as many people infected by the disease have now recovered. Fatal cases remain highly concentrated in the Hubei region around Wuhan, where the outbreak originated.
Markets in Europe picked up on reports of progress by lab researchers with drugs aimed at treating the disease, while an institute in Wuhan applied for a patent on an antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences , threatening to revive U.S.-China tensions over intellectual property.
Apple  supplier Hon Hai revised down its sales outlook for the year citing the virus, while Disney said it expects the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong to hit operating profits by a combined $175 million.
2. Stocks, oil set for higher opening on virus optimism
U.S. stock markets are set for another strong opening, helped by more solid gains in Asia and Europe overnight, which in turn reflected the Chinese central bank’s liquidity measures this week and the – still somewhat speculative - reports of progress in finding drugs to treat the coronavirus.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were up 264 points or 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.0%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite had ended up 1.3% while in Europe, the Stoxx 600 was up 1.1%.

Crude oil futures had rebounded overnight after dipping below $50 for the first time in a year. U.S. crude futures were up 2.9% at $51.06 a barrel, while gold futures were flat at $1,556.15 and the U.S. 10-Year benchmark Treasury yielded 1.64%, up three basis points from late Tuesday. 
The bounce in crude is set to be tested by the release of government inventory data at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT).
3. GM earnings in focus after Ford slumps; ICE-eBay tie-up also eyed

Earnings seasons grinds on, with the focus Wednesday falling on General Motors after Ford Motor slumped 10% in after-hours trading on the back of a gloomy outlook for 2020. Ford’s figures made for an interesting counterpoint to the wild, but volatile, surge in Tesla  stock on Tuesday amid signs that the company’s valuation had lost all relation to any realistic development in sales and profit in the near term.

Also reporting in the course of the day are pharma giant Merck, Humana, Boston Scientific , Spotify and Metlife. Qualcomm completes day s action after the bell.
Another stock likely to be in focus Wednesday is Intercontinental Exchange Group. ICE , which owns the New York Stock Exchange, confirmed late on Tuesday it had offered to buy struggllng online marketplace eBay , in a radical departure for a group which has so far concentrated only on wholesale financial markets. ICE stock, which fell 7.5% on Tuesday on initial reports of talks, recovered 0.8% in after-hours trading as it emerged that no talks were currently in progress.
4. ADP s report to trail Friday payrolls ballyhoo
ADP  will update the market on the U.S. private-sector labor market, amid expectations of a slowdown in hiring at the start of the year after the December numbers surged to a seven-month high.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expect a gain of 156,000 in what is widely seen as the dress rehearsal for the broader government report on payrolls on Friday. The report is due at 8:15 AM ET.  
Economic data around the world were mixed: China’s service-sector purchasing managers index fell short of expectations, while the same index in the euro zone outperformed, pushing the composite PMI to a five-month high of 51.3.  The ISM’s survey of non-manufacturing activity will be released at 10 AM ET.
5. Buttigeig wins in Iowa as Washington theatricals intensify
Pete Buttigeig emerged as the winner of the Democratic Party’s Iowa caucuses, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders a close second and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren a respectable third. Former Vice-President Joe Biden trailed badly in fourth place after a lackluster campaign.
Buttigeig capitalized on the inability of Sanders and Warren to campaign more actively in the state during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which is expected to end today with his acquittal by a Republican-controlled Senate. "

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Thousands of passengers and crew on two cruise ships in Asian waters were placed in quarantine for China s coronavirus on Wednesday as airlines, car manufacturers and other global companies counted the cost of the fast-spreading outbreak.
China said another 65 people had died as of Tuesday, the highest daily total yet, taking the overall toll on the mainland to 490, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year.
There have been two deaths outside mainland China, both following visits to Wuhan. A man in the Philippines died last week, and a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness died in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong on Tuesday.
The virus had disrupted air travel, with more than two dozen airlines suspending or restricting flights to China and several countries, including the United States, banning the entry of anyone who has been in China over the previous two weeks.
Taiwan banned the entry of mainland residents from Thursday.
The disruption spread to cruise ships this week, with about 3,700 people facing at least two weeks locked away on a liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed that 10 people aboard had tested positive for the virus.
Passengers on the Diamond Princess posted pictures online of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks and an empty deck.
""This is not a good situation,"" British passenger David Abel said in a video shot in his cabin and posted to Facebook .
In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship docked in the city for tests after three people on board had tested positive earlier.
Hong Kong s Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, saying conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis.
 American Airlines Group   and United Airlines  said they would suspend flights to and from Hong Kong after this week, a step that would leave no U.S. carriers flying passengers to the Asian financial hub.
Nearly $700 billion was wiped off mainland Chinese stocks on Monday with many factories shut, cities cut off and travel links constricted, fuelling worries about global supply chains. Asian stocks steadied on Wednesday.
 Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) will suspend production in South Korea because of a disruption to the supply of parts, it said, becoming the first major carmaker to do so outside of China.
Global carmakers have already extended factory closures in China in line with government guidelines. These include Hyundai, Tesla , Ford , PSA  Peugeot  Citroen , Nissan (T:7201) and Honda Motor
IMPACT ON TRADE DEAL
Planemaker Airbus  has prolonged a planned closure of its final assembly plant in Tianjin, China, it said.
Taiwan s Foxconn (TW:2317), which makes phones for global vendors including Apple , aims to gradually restart factories in China next week but could take at least a week or two more to resume full production, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from a Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect this month.
Japan s central bank was ready to ramp up stimulus measures for the world s third-biggest economy, citing uncertainty over the virus.
Evidence of human-to-human spread outside China surfaced after an international business gathering in Singapore in January was linked to virus cases reported in Malaysia and South Korea, but authorities did not comment on its nature or the industry involved.
Singapore - one of the worst hit countries outside China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - has reported 24 cases of the new coronavirus.
Across mainland China, there were 3,887 new confirmed infections of the coronavirus, making a total of 24,324. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in some 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.
Macau, a gambling hub and like Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, ordered casinos to suspend operations on Tuesday, effectively halting the lifeblood of its economy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, but experts say its mortality and transmission rates are unknown. Pregnant women may be able to pass it to their unborn children, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
Asked about various media reports of ""drug breakthroughs"", WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: ""There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV.""
Russia said it would take between eight and 10 months to develop a vaccine, the Interfax news agency reported. Scores of Russians began two weeks of quarantine in Siberia on Wednesday after being flown home from Wuhan.
Beijing has criticized as an overreaction U.S. travel curbs that bar foreign nationals who have visited China.
""We have the ability and confidence to finally win this war of containment,"" China s state councillor Wang Yi told Thailand s foreign minister.
A Thai taxi-driver who recovered from the infection told reporters in Bangkok of his shock at catching it and had a message of support for Wuhan.
""If I can beat it, so can you.""

By Kim Khan 

Investing.com – Movie studio Lions Gate Entertainment climbed Wednesday on speculation that it could be a hot acquisition commodity as the streaming wars heat up.

Shares of Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE:LGFa) rose 5% following a report from Forbes naming it as a candidate to become the first Silicon Valley studio.

While huge deals by Walt   Disney    and AT&T  make the merger space at the top extremely limited, streaming companies may want to snap up a mini studio for production like Lions Gate, MGM or Sony Entertainment, Forbes said.
A deal like that would also give suitors like Netflix  or Apple  a library of existing movie and TV content, it added.
That would be especially important as Disney turns up the heat. The House of Mouse just reported that its Disney+ streaming service hit 26.5 million subscribers. The service can draw on an entire catalog of Disney, Marvel and Star Wars content.
Lions Gate owns franchises like “The Hunger Games” and “Twilight.”"

(Reuters) - Spotify  Technology SA on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue largely below analysts  estimates, as the streaming service spends more on promotions to lure listeners in its battle against Apple  Music and Amazon .
Shares of the Swedish company were down 5% at $147 in midday trading.
Spotify s paid subscriptions rose a better-than-expected 29% in the fourth quarter, largely from discounted promotional plans.
The company ran several campaigns in the quarter, including a ""3 months on us"" intro offer for new users and a win-back offer for returning customers.
Spotify is also spending more on podcasts, trying to keep pace with its two closest rivals - Apple Music with more than 60 million subscribers as of June and Amazon, which has more than 55 million subscribers globally.
Paid subscribers, which make up nearly 90% of its revenue, tallied 124 million for the three months ended Dec. 31. Analysts on average expected 122 million, according to FactSet. 
The company forecast first-quarter premium subscriber numbers largely in line with estimates. It expects total premium subscribers in the range of 126 million to 131 million for the first quarter compared with the estimate of 128 million, according to FactSet Estimates.
But Spotify reported a decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) for the fourth quarter.
""Our ARPU was down 5% in Q4 and we expect similar declines for 2020,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Vogel told Reuters. 
Spotify also said it bought Ringer, the sports and entertainment podcast network founded by Bill Simmons, for an undisclosed price.
""What we really did with The Ringer, I think, is we bought the next ESPN,"" said Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek in a post-earnings call. 
""And we think that s going to be a tremendously valuable property as we look at the development of sports over the next decade."" 
The company, which launched its music service over a decade ago, has invested over $500 million to build its podcast business and currently has over 700,000 podcast titles.
""It s clearer than ever to us that podcast listening is driving the overall health of our business,"" Ek said.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 24% to 1.86 billion euros ($2.05 billion), missing expectation of 1.89 billion euros, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Spotify expects first-quarter revenue in the range of 1.71 billion euros to 1.91 billion euros, compared with estimate of 1.90 billion euros.
The company reported a loss attributable to shareholders of 209 million euros, or 1.14 euros per share, hurt mainly by social costs in Sweden.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled nearly $12.6 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week, extending the longest retreat from the U.S. stock market since 2016, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The outflows came during a week in which fears of the coronavirus outbreak in China led to the biggest declines in benchmark equity indexes in four months despite stronger than expected earnings from tech giants such as Apple Inc . Investors have pulled nearly $34 billion out of U.S. stock funds since the beginning of the year, while the benchmark S&P 500 index is up roughly 3% over the same time."

Google - along with  Facebook Inc   , Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc  - are under a series of probes into allegations that the tech behemoths use their clout to defend their market share or expand into adjacent markets.
""I m literally open to doing what works. I would look at any remedy as a possible solution,"" said Paxton. ""I m not going to say I prefer one remedy over another when I don t even know fully what the problem is. I want this to benefit the most number of consumers.""
Paxton was among several attorneys general at the Justice Department on Tuesday to meet officials at the agency to coordinate federal and state efforts.
Asked if a potential breakup was in the cards, Paxton said: ""Everything is on the table. It s kind of up to them to take stuff off the table.""
""Most people are just not aware of Google s dominance. Everyone thinks that the internet s free,"" he added. ""The pricing reflects the fact that there s only one player.""
Paxton s team is fighting Google in court over hiring conditions for two consultants that Texas wants on its team. Google wants them to be barred from working for the company s rivals for a year after their work with Texas ends.
Paxton said he would like the probe to end quickly. Asked how Google could make that happen, he said, ""Cooperate? Tell their story? Tell a story that makes sense?""
Google has been cooperating, the company said in a statement. ""We have been working constructively with the Texas attorney general and have produced a substantial volume of information in response to his inquiry even as we seek assurances that our confidential business information won t be shared with competitors or vocal complainants.""The Justice Department said in late July it was opening a broad antitrust investigation of the big digital firms. Attorney General Bill Barr has since said he would like the probe completed by the end of the year.

The companies have come under fire from both ends of the political spectrum. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the companies and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for the break-up of Amazon and Facebook."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla s  stock tumbled 17% on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally as a senior executive said the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars and analysts warned of its high valuation.
With Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to ""hold"" from ""buy,"" further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.
Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10.
The $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk s plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.
Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Tesla s stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies.
Even after Wednesday s drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon  at 49, Apple  at 22 and Alphabet  at 23, according to Refinitiv data.
""We ve never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,"" Gill wrote.
Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak.
The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day.
""Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,"" Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share.
The stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesday s drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.
Tesla s rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.
Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW  and Volkswagen . Even many Tesla bulls question the stock s valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.
 Barclays   analyst Brian Johnson maintained his ""underweight"" rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.
""We continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued – but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business,"" Johnson wrote in a client note.
Following Canaccord s downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla s stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv."

(Reuters) - Qualcomm  Inc on Wednesday detailed the first significant sales gains from a new category of chip it is selling to mobile phone makers, but also disclosed that an antitrust investigation has started around those chips.
The European Union is investigating whether Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive behavior by leveraging its market position in 5G modem chips in the radio frequency chip market, the San Diego company said on Wednesday in a regulatory filing.
The disclosure comes after the company spent years battling regulators - and paid billions of dollars in fines - over allegations that it engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices. Qualcomm last year lost a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and remains locked in an appeal.
Qualcomm supplies ""modem"" chips, also sometimes called baseband processors, that connect mobile phones to wireless data networks.
But the company is also expanding into a related field called radio frequency front-end chips, which have become more complex in phones that use 5G networks.
Qualcomm has been trying to persuade phone makers to buy its radio frequency chips, together with its own modem chips, rather than selecting parts from separate vendors and integrating them.
Other major suppliers of radio frequency chips are Broadcom  Inc, Skyworks  Solutions Inc and Qorvo Inc. 
Qualcomm executives said on Wednesday that revenue from the radio frequency market contributed to a sales forecast that beat analyst expectations.
In Wednesday s filing, Qualcomm said it was in the process of responding to a probe by the European Commission, the EU s executive branch, after it served a request for information with the company on Dec. 3.
Qualcomm said the commission could impose a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue if a violation were found.
Qualcomm was fined 242 million euros by the European Commission in July last year for blocking a rival from the market about a decade ago, its second EU antitrust penalty. The Commission had also fined Qualcomm 997 million euros during 2018 for paying iPhone maker Apple  to use only its chips, a tactic aimed at thwarting rivals including  Intel Corp   . 
Qualcomm has won radio frequency chip contracts with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, Alphabet  Inc s Google and LG Electronics Inc, among others.
Analysts said the EU investigation was unlikely to slow Qualcomm s progress in the radio frequency chip market.

""Qualcomm has been penalized many times for anti-competitive practices. It s one of the risks of the story,"" said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors. ""They have market clout because their technology is much better than the competition."""

By Kim Khan 
Investing.com – Apple  will face some disruption in its plans for ramped-up delivery of its hot AirPods due to the Wuhan coronavirus, according to a published report Thursday.

Suppliers for the earphones in China have had to halt operations for two weeks and components for the product may not be available when work resumes, Nikkei Asian Review reported.

Apple had requested suppliers to make up to 45 million units in the first half of 2020 amid strong demand, it said.

On Saturday, Apple said it was shutting all its stores and corporate offices in China until Feb. 9 due to the outbreak.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc s  Google Maps on Thursday launched a redesign that prominently solicits users  reviews and photos of places they visit, seeking to increase its data in a field led by local search apps such as Zomato, TripAdvisor and  Yelp .
The new look, which coincides with Google Maps  15th birthday, introduces a ""Contribute"" tab to a menu at the bottom of the service s mobile app, Google said in a blog post. 
The move prompted concern from TripAdvisor Inc , which along with Yelp Inc  and other companies that feature user reviews on businesses have encouraged antitrust investigations into whether Google has improperly used its dominance in search to popularize its newer tools, such as restaurant comparison. 
Google s ""maps redesign efforts is something antitrust enforcers should scrutinize closely,"" TripAdvisor said in a statement. ""We believe their continued practices should raise increased concern in the name of competition and consumer protection.""
Yelp and Zomato did not respond to requests to comment.
Google said it had responded to user feedback to make contributing easier for the hundreds of millions of people each year who submit data.
Apple Inc s  maps app, which launched seven years ago, takes a different approach by incorporating reviews and photos from services such as Yelp.
Google has invested billions of dollars from its search ads business to digitally map the world, drawing 1 billion users each month to its free navigation app. 
The company has sought to turn a profit on that investment by increasing ad sales throughout Google Maps, and having users be able to rely on it for data on places and transit would expand advertising opportunities.
Among other announcements on Thursday, Google Maps said it would ask users to share more about their train and bus rides, including the temperature of cabins, accommodations for people with impaired mobility, and security and safety features.
It already uses its ability to track users  location and survey them to determine how crowded transit is. 

Some regional apps for transit and local business information contend they have better real-time data and more vetting of user content than Google. But Google s global footprint along with its ability to crowdsource user data have been big advantages."

But when it comes to the company’s valuation, neither truly fits.
The stock’s stunning ascent -- doubling in just the first 23 sessions of the year on record vehicle deliveries, the opening of a China plant and an earlier-than-expected profit at a jointly operated battery factory -- has cooled off as exuberance gives way to caution. But the still-meteoric advance of the last five weeks has prompted more comparisons with high-growth technology names, and even has tech-focused market watchers looking more closely at the stock’s fundamentals.
“With Tesla’s extraordinary rise from $180 last year to nearly $1,000 this past Tuesday, we are receiving an increasing volume of calls from tech PMs and analysts who have begun to pick up coverage of Tesla from the traditional industrials/autos cohort,”  Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a report, referring to portfolio managers.
The stock was volatile again Thursday, reversing early declines after two Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation to create a nationwide network of electric-vehicle charging stations. The measure is unlikely to pass in an election year with Republicans controlling the Senate.
Auto Comparisons
Tesla’s valuation, which hovered around $132 billion after Wednesday’s plunge, reflects a price-to-sales multiple around 5, compared with 0.4 for General Motors Co . and 0.2 for Ford Motor  Co. Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also trade at a multiple of less than 1. Tesla bulls, however, say it’s unfair to compare it with legacy automakers, pointing instead to technology companies as its true peers.
“It appears Tesla, in the market’s view, has gone far past the point of comparison vs traditional auto companies,” Jonas said. While Tesla’s valuation is an order of magnitude higher than autos peers, he said, “we think this is largely deserved -- Tesla is a significantly faster-growing auto company, and it is also more than an auto company.”
Yet the current share price doesn’t stand up to scrutiny when comparing Tesla with the more diversified Nasdaq 100 Index. Members of the gauge trade at an average of 6.28 times their sales and 36.5 times their earnings, which implies that Tesla would need an annual profit of $4.6 billion to justify its market value. Members of the technology-focused NYSE FANG+ Index trade at 50 times their earnings.
Tesla can’t yet be measured on a comparable price-to-earnings basis since it hasn’t had four straight profitable quarters on a GAAP basis. It was in the black in the past two periods on an adjusted basis.
“Tesla could be at $900, but it would need revenues like Volkswagen, margins like Apple , and reinvest like no other manufacturing company in history has ever done,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business who specializes in valuation. It’s possible Tesla succeeds in doing one of those things, but “connect them together and that’s when the story implodes. This is a Grimm fairy tale with manic swings.”
Little Sense
Tesla reported an annual loss on a GAAP basis of about $862 million for 2019. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect it to reach $4.9 billion in net income in 2023.
“Tesla is trading at well over two times the enterprise value of Daimler, and three times of BMW,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin, said in an interview. “That doesn’t seem to make so much sense to me.”
The debate comes down to whether Tesla has a years- or some day even a decade-long lead over other automakers in the electric-car race. It “seems the market has decided it’s a much longer lead than a one or two years,” Irwin said.
“Not to sound like an ‘OK, boomer’ to the younger investors rushing into Tesla shares, but the recent price action brings to mind Nasdaq circa 1999,”  Barclays   auto analyst Brian Johnson said. The recent price surge opened up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, reducing any chance of a stalled business, yet Tesla remains fundamentally overvalued, he said.
Tesla’s volatile swings over the past few days called to mind a similar performance from Qualcomm  Inc. almost exactly 20 years ago, when the stock soared 360% over five months. After touching a high of $100 in early January 2000, the stock started paring the gains. Only now, roughly two decades later, has it re-approached those levels. Qualcomm traded around $88 Thursday after issuing a disappointing forecast for second-quarter chip shipments."

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - More than two dozen large trade fairs and industry conferences in Asia have been postponed because of the spread of the China coronavirus, shuttering events where billions of dollars worth of deals have been signed in the past. 
The pushed back events, including some scheduled as late as the end of March, show the ripple effect the virus is having on businesses globally, with airlines cancelling flights as governments and companies curb travel, and thousand of factories and shops remain shut.
The venue of China s oldest and biggest trade fair, the Canton Fair, has suspended exhibitions until further notice. It was due to hold its spring exhibition at the complex from April 15. Last year, $29.7 billion worth of deals were signed at the event. 
Organizers of the East China Import and Export Commodity Fair - due to be held in Shanghai over March 1-4 - said they would postpone the event, without giving later dates. The fair that usually attracts traders of garments and household goods, announced $2.3 billion in deals last year.
The Chinese government has also asked local authorities and business associations to hold off hosting events and conferences, as concerns rise about the disease that has killed more than 560 people and infected over 28,000.
""Clients are asking me, is it safe to go to China and that s a very hard question to answer,"" said Malcolm McNeil, a partner at global law firm Arent Fox, whose clients include U.S.-based firms with business interests in China. 
A client scheduled to go to Shenzhen in southern China decided to put that off until June, McNeil said. He expects it to take at least six-nine months before people regain full confidence to travel to China again for business.
Other postponed events, due to be held in the last two weeks of March, include the annual trade conference for the global chip industry in China, SEMICON, and the International Building and Construction Trade Fair in Shanghai.
The annual China Development Forum, a high-level gathering of international leaders, whose past attendees included Apple  Chief Executive Tim Cook, will be delayed, its organizers said. It is usually held in late March. 
The outbreak casts doubt on attendance at high-profile events outside China as well, industry executives said, as companies restrict mainland Chinese visitors from traveling to other countries. 
Korea s LG Electronics (KS:066570) has withdrawn from the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona scheduled for Feb 24-27.
HOSPITALITY IMPACT
In Singapore, Food & Hotel Asia s trade show, which attracted more than 80,000 people in 2018, has postponed the first of two events it had planned in the city-state this year.
Travel fair NATAS Travel 2020 has also been pushed back.
At least four employees of a multinational company that held a meeting of more than 100 international staff in Singapore in January contracted the virus, sparking a World Health Organization investigation of the case. 
Some hotels are bracing for the impact to be at least as bad as the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, based on booking cancellations so far, industry sources said. 
""Multinational companies who are the main customers of luxury hotels have halted trips to China ... all big events have been called off across the country,"" said Mei Xin, an analyst with Huatai Securities in Beijing, adding that these were key revenue sources for high-end hotels.
Hotel occupancy in China, at 70% on Jan. 14, dropped by three quarters within the next two weeks, a report by hospitality industry consultancy STR published on Tuesday showed.

A report by data consultancy Tourism Economics published last week forecasted that visits to the United States from China could drop by 28% in 2020, equivalent to 4.6 million hotel room nights and $5.8 billion in visitor spending."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A number of Chinese manufacturers including a subsidiary of Apple Inc  partner Foxconn (TW:2317) have refitted production lines to make masks and medical clothing, as a deadly coronavirus spreads across China.
The move highlights how private companies are pitching in to alleviate a nationwide shortage of medical gear amid the health crisis, at times expanding beyond their core lines of business.
In a social media post on Thursday, Foxconn - formally  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd - said it has begun trial production of surgical masks at its Longhua Park plant in Shenzhen, and expects to produce 2 million masks daily by the end of the month.
The Taiwanese company said the masks would initially be produced for internal use by its hundreds of thousands of employees, the majority of whom work in factories in mainland China.
SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co Ltd, a joint venture automaker formed by General Motors Co  and two Chinese partners, also announced on Thursday via social media that it will set up 14 production lines with the goal of making 1.7 million masks daily.
On Tuesday, Hongdou Group Co Ltd [HONGD.UL], a clothing manufacturer founded in the 1950s, wrote on social media it had refitted a factory to make disposable medical suits.
The company said it intends to produce about 60,000 protective suits a month and will send them to the government for allocation and distribution. Hongdou employs 30,000 people, its website showed.
Apparel peers Zhejiang Giuseppe Garment Co Ltd (SZ:002687) and  Jihua Group  Corp Ltd (SS:601718) have launched similar initiatives, state media outlets reported this week.
Factories inside and outside of China have worked around the clock to keep up with demand since the outbreak of the virus at the end of last year in the eastern Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province. High street pharmacies have posted signs telling customers masks are not in stock.
One Czech mask manufacturer told Reuters in late January that orders had increased 57,000% with in four days.
To cope with the shortage, localities in China have set up rationing systems."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  sellers are bracing for product shortages as Chinese workers - worried about the fast-spreading coronavirus - may be unable or unwilling to return to idled factories.
Brandon Young, who pulls in more than $10 million in annual revenue from the online marketplace, has a 30-45 day supply of portable Apple Inc  watch chargers that could be difficult to replenish because they are built from genuine Apple components that are exclusively made in China. 
Plugable Technologies founder Bernie Thompson says he could run out of his top-selling triple display laptop docking station by the end of this month, even if factories open as planned next week. 
The entrepreneurs are among the 1 million-plus Amazon sellers whose livelihoods depend on factory workers in China, where the coronavirus has sickened more than 30,000 and killed more than 600 people. Their predicament foreshadows the risk Amazon sellers face if China s fast-moving epidemic results in worker shortages or prolonged factory closures.
Running out of product on Amazon can wipe out a small business. Amazon s algorithm gives top billing to sellers with the briskest and most recent sales. That prominent placement helps drive even more sales. 
""Going out of stock is the best way to kill that,"" Plugable s Thompson said. 
Amazon s revenue from services to third-party sellers accounted for just over 19% of Amazon s net sales in 2019. That figure did not include proceeds from Amazon s lucrative advertising business. In a letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said those independent merchants accounted for 58% of physical goods sold on Amazon in 2018. 
""Currently, there is no interruption to our operations,"" Amazon said in a statement. 
Young says many Amazon sellers stocked up before the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of workers travel hundreds of miles to visit family and manufacturing virtually shuts down for two to three weeks.
""People do have extra inventory, but that will quickly run out"" if factories remain shuttered or workers do not return, said Young, who is ""self-quarantined"" at his Miami home after visiting factories and family in China during the holiday period. He did not visit the epicenter of the outbreak.
Thompson ordered more of his popular docking stations, which connect a laptop to three monitors, in October. 
He built in extra time for setbacks and was still OK when the factory missed its January delivery date. China s decision to extend Lunar New Year factory closures by a week wiped out what was left of his safety buffer. 
""We would have been fine if coronavirus hadn t happened - but with that extra delay, we won t get stock in time,"" said Thompson, who founded his Redmond, Washington-based company in 2009. 
He has been unable to reach many of his Chinese suppliers, but those he has spoken with said they plan to restart operations around Feb. 10, when they will face an even larger-than-normal crush of post-holiday work. The finished product will take another two to three weeks to reach the U.S. West Coast via ocean container ship. 
One provider of a tool that tracks third-party listings on Amazon told Reuters they have seen a rise in ""out of stock"" products. 
In a post published https://gs.amazon.cn/news/news-brand-200201.html?ref=as_cn_ags_news_brand_13 on its Chinese website on Saturday, Amazon advised Chinese sellers to avoid low inventory and shipping delays due to the coronavirus. Tips included delisting products and putting stores into inactive mode. 
That is just the latest challenge for U.S. sellers. Many saw their profitability hit by a prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat last year.
""This is insult to injury,"" Michael Smerling, president of Chicago-area LCI Brands, said of the coronavirus. He estimates tariffs reduced profits by 75% last year.
The seller of money belts and travel pillows knew how to manage through the trade war, Smerling said. ""The coronavirus is completely different - we don t know the impact of this.""
Some merchants are searching for ways to switch sourcing out of China. 
Young, who sells toys, travel bags and other products on Amazon, is looking for factories in Mexico, South American, India, Pakistan and Vietnam.
Jayme Smaldone, CEO of New Jersey-based Mighty Mug, will increase his order of plastic mugs from Taiwan if his 90-day supply of stainless steel mugs from China dwindles.
Many companies listing on Amazon do not have contingency plans for dealing with a lengthy shutdown in China, said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com. 

""There are going to be a lot of headaches and heartache,"" McCabe said."

U.S. hiring picked up in January much faster than expected. 225,000 new jobs were created last month, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department.
Unseasonably mild temperatures gave hiring in weather-sensitive sectors like construction a boost.
A tightening labor market is starting to consistently matter where it counts: wallets. Average paychecks saw a 3.1 percent jump over the past 12 months. That pay raise is likely to be enough to ensure the mighty U.S. consumer keeps on spending.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate moved up to 3.6 percent as more Americans returned to the workforce and started looking for work.
Despite January s solid hiring data there are some cracks showing.
Revisions by the Labor Department showed the economy created half a million fewer jobs than previously announced for the period of April 2018 to March 2019.

In a report released Friday ahead of Fed chairman Jerome Powell s twice-a-year update to Congress next week, the Fed said the recent emergence of the coronavirus could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.
Major U.S. airlines have halted flights to China, consumer brands including  Nike   have warned the coronavirus is taking its toll as stores remain shut, and manufacturing supply chains for the likes of Tesla  and Apple  have been disrupted with workers forced to stay home.
Even with the potential fallout, the Fed says the likelihood of a U.S. recession occurring over the next year has dramatically reduced in recent months.
It noted a manufacturing slump caused by an unwillingness for businesses to spend during numerous trade spats between the U.S. and trading partners - wasn t enough to drag the economy into a recession.
And pointed to continued strength in the U.S. job market and consumer spending.
The U.S. economy is in the midst of a record-long economic expansion that began after the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
The Fed cut rates three times last year amid fears the U.S.-China trade war threatened to slam the brakes on that recovery but has since declared it is no rush to move rates up or down."

Treasuries jumped.
The S&P 500 Index halted a four-day rally, but remained on track for its best week since June, as automakers and other industrial companies led losses. The latest jobs report showed hiring stayed robust last month, bolstering optimism growth can persist. But stocks remained lower after reports of further infections, an increase in deaths and more quarantines.
The Federal Reserve warned the outbreak posed a “new risk” to the economy. The fallout for companies is starting to come into focus, with corporations such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. temporarily halting operations in China. Apple Inc .’s iPhone maker Foxconn told employees not to return to work when China’s extended break ends Monday.
The 10-year Treasury yield slumped below 1.6% and crude lost its grip on $51 a barrel.
“The market moved up so quickly over the last few days and I think papered over the continued risk associated with the coronavirus,” said Robin Anderson, senior global economist at Principal Global Investors. “There’s still a lot of unknowns out there.”
Australia’s dollar dropped to its lowest level in a decade with the fallout from the coronavirus hurting riskier assets. Equities pushed lower across most of Asia as news of further infections on a cruise ship off Japan offered another reminder that cases remain on the rise. Singapore boosted its disease response to the second-highest level, the same one for the SARS epidemic. Confirmed cases worldwide now total 31,432, having risen more than 3,000 in one day, while the death toll reached 638.

(Reuters) - ViacomCBS Inc is preparing to launch a subscription streaming video service that will combine the free and paid services of CBS, programming from brands including MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and BET as well as films from the Paramount movies studio, a source familiar with the matter said.
The yet-unnamed new service is expected to build on top of CBS All-Access and include live and on-demand news sports and entertainment spanning the portfolio of its brands. Blockbuster franchises from the Paramount library, such as ""Top Gun"", ""Mission Impossible"", ""The Godfather"" and ""Star Trek"", are eventually expected to be available on the service.
A higher-priced, premium version of the service will include Showtime shows.
The company is not expected to plow the multi-billions of dollars of new investment into the service, the source said. Instead it will build from the existing properties.
It is not clear when it will launch.
Details of the service have yet to be finalized. Executives are expected to discuss the strategy next Thursday when the company reports fourth-quarter financial results, the source said.
CNBC reported the effort earlier on Thursday.
ViacomCBS will become the latest media company to wade in the big media and tech streaming war after Apple Inc  and Walt  Disney   Co launched services in November to compete with streaming giant Netflix Inc .
Comcast  Corp s NBCUniversal is also expected to launch its Peacock streaming service that will offer free and subscription versions.
ViacomCBS was among the first of the big media companies to launch streaming services, albeit smaller in scope. CBS All Access, which costs between $6 and $10 per month, launched in 2014. The Showtime streaming service, which costs $11 per month, launched in 2015.
Viacom purchased Pluto TV, a free service, last year for $340 million and it will play a big role in ViacomCBS s streaming video strategy.
The company has avoided the high stakes battle among Disney and the tech and telecom giants to furnish new services with original shows and movies and has pursued a strategy of creating and producing shows for other services including Amazon  and Netflix. That will continue, the source said.
Paramount s huge library will be a big part of the service, but the new service will not be the ""first home"" for Paramount films after theatrical release, the source said. Epix, a pay TV network owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, owns those rights.

CBS and Viacom completed their merger in December, reuniting media mogul Sumner Redstone s U.S. entertainment empire."

SHENZHEN, China/BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese economy will sputter towards normal on Monday after the coronavirus outbreak forced an extended holiday, although numerous stores and factories will remain shut and many white collar employees will continue working from home.
The usually week-long Lunar New Year holiday was extended by 10 days in much of China amid mounting alarm over an epidemic that as of Saturday morning had killed 722 people.
Huge cities including Beijing and Shanghai seem like ghost towns, with shops and restaurants closed or empty, and as containment measures including transportation curbs are enforced in many parts of the country. Some cities are keeping schools closed and restrictions on movements remain.
Many employers in the southern technology hub of Shenzhen are taking precautions to prevent workers from returning in large crowds, asking those who have traveled from elsewhere to self-quarantine for up to 14 days.
Calls to the hotlines of an NGO serving migrant workers in nearby city of Guangzhou have multiplied in recent days.
""People are asking,  what if my factory hasn t put enough safety measures in place? Will there be a notice suspending work again? How do I get in to work if roads are sealed off? "" said Ice Huang, a spokeswoman for the Inno Community Development Organization.
Apple Inc  said on Friday its retail stores in China would stay closed, even as it worked toward opening its corporate offices and contact centers.
Apple supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) plans only to ""gradually"" restart its factories with a view to resuming full production in late February, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
While in Shanghai, the city government said Tesla s  factory would reopen on Monday.
The toll on China s already-slowing economy has been heavy, with Goldman Sachs  cutting its first quarter GDP target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying an even deeper hit is possible.
""It s certainly not going to be a return to normal next week,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. ""The longer this disruption continues the higher the risk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger hit on the economy,"" he said.
TEMPERATURE CHECKS, HOME QUARANTINE
In Shenzhen, businesses looking to reopen were required to check the recent travel history of all staff and implement temperature checks and prevention measures such as providing masks. Similar guidelines were in place elsewhere.
Some businesses told Reuters that they were not sure when they would reopen.
""We re still not sure we ll be open on Monday,"" Suki, who works in human resources for a Belgian-owned manufacturing company in Shenzhen and declined to give her surname.
""We applied online to open five days ago but inspectors only visited today,"" she said on Friday.
Still, Sunday is set to be the peak travel day of the Lunar New Year period, an official from the Transport Ministry said this week, as millions of Chinese return from their holidays."

The rationale that the increase in people using a platform makes its value increase exponentially — as it happens with Facebook or the App Store — is applied to cryptocurrencies at large: The more people that hold a crypto asset, the bigger increase in market value.
Further reports have suggested that these companies intend to launch their coins after Facebook’s Libra introduction to the market. Some of these companies have been the darlings of the stock market, but recent shifts in consumer preferences show that a segment of the population (i.e., millennials) already prefer investing in Bitcoin instead of FAANG stocks like Netflix. While this is intriguing, the question is: Are investors better off investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies than in FAANG stocks?"
222,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/chinas-shenzhen-says-foxconn-to-resume-operations-after-inspections-2080025,2020-02-09,China's Shenzhen denies blocking Apple supplier Foxconn from resuming production By Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Local Chinese authorities have not blocked Apple  supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) from resuming production amid a coronavirus outbreak, they said in a statement on Sunday, denying an earlier report in the Nikkei Business Daily. 
The Nikkei, citing four people familiar with the matter, said https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus-outbreak/China-blocks-restart-of-Foxconn-plants-due-to-coronavirus-sources on Saturday that public health experts had carried out inspections at Foxconn s factories and told the company that there was a ""high risk of coronavirus infection"" at the facilities, making them unsuitable for a production restart. 
Shenzhen s Longhua district, where Foxconn s largest factory is located, said in a statement on its official WeChat account on Sunday that those reports were untrue and that it was still conducting checks, adding that the company would restart production once inspections were completed.
It said it had received proposals from three Foxconn subsidiaries on Feb. 6 detailing how the Taipei-headquartered firm, which makes smartphones for Apple and other brands, planned to put in place epidemic prevention and control measures.
The thousands of workers that work in Foxconn s factories will need to wear masks, undergo temperature checks, and adhere to a dining system considered safe, it said in the statement. 
""We will announce to the public the company s production resumption situation in a timely manner,"" it added.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that tens of thousands of workers had already returned from an extended new year holiday and were waiting to start work on Feb. 10, even though plants in Zhengzhou, Shenzhen and Kunshan had not received the go ahead to resume production.
Foxconn on Saturday said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters that operation schedules for its facilities in China would follow the recommendations of local governments, but declined to comment on specific production facilities.
""We have not received any requests from our customers on the need to resume production earlier (than the local governments  recommendations),"" it said. 
The Chinese economy will sputter toward normal on Monday after the coronavirus outbreak forced authorities in much of the country to extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by 10 days amid mounting alarm over an epidemic that by Sunday had killed over 800 people.

Foxconn could see a ""big"" production impact and shipments to customers including Apple face disruption if the Chinese factory halt extends into a second week, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters earlier this week. "
223,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/nightmare-for-global-tech-coronavirus-fallout-just-beginning-2080235,2020-02-10,‘Nightmare’ for Global Tech: Coronavirus Fallout Just Beginning By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- As Chinese-based manufacturers begin to restart factories Monday, no one knows for sure when they’ll be back at full-speed -- or what sort of chaos may ensue.
Tech producers led by Foxconn, which makes the majority of the world’s iPhones from Zhengzhou a few hundred miles from the coronavirus outbreak’s epicenter, had begun preparing investors for the potential bedlam when hundreds of thousands make their way back to factories. Apple Inc .’s most important partner warned investors of the daunting task of securing enough workers despite widespread transport blockades, quarantining thousands, and the “nightmare” scenario of an on-campus epidemic that could shut down production altogether. Last week, it took the unprecedented step of warning workers to stay away from its Shenzhen headquarters till further notice as government inspectors vet its containment procedures, Bloomberg News reported.
“How we can make sure there will be no infection within our campuses will be the first priority, because if you put a lot of people together and one of them gets infected, that will be a nightmare,” Foxconn investor relations chief Alex Yang told investors on a Thursday call, according to a recording obtained by Bloomberg News. “We try very hard to make sure the possibility of any on-site infection will be as low as zero, although it will be challenging.”

The deadly virus has illustrated the increasingly central role China plays in global manufacturing, from clothing and chemicals to automobiles and especially technology. Just about every major piece of consumer electronics is made in China, from iPhones and gaming consoles to half the world’s liquid crystal display or LCD screens. The contagion has already shuttered plants across China for a week longer than anticipated after the Lunar New Year break -- a disruption that could get much worse if rolling quarantines and suspended rail and air links prevent the return of the millions of blue-collar laborers at the heart of electronics assembly.
When they do make it back, untold numbers will get funneled into a quarantine of up to two weeks -- a sequester of unknown scale. Any disruptions at Chinese plants can, in a worst-case scenario, freeze parts of the supply chain by triggering cascading shortages. Influential supply chain analyst Kuo Ming-chi of TF International estimates Foxconn’s main iPhone-making base will properly resume work only next week -- and then at 40% to 60% capacity.  Citigroup   estimates just 30% of the entire Chinese semiconductor workforce is estimated to return to their workplaces as of Feb 11.
Foxconn said in a statement Saturday it’s working with local governments to prepare for the return of employees, without specifics. Shenzhen’s Longhua district said in a WeChat post it was helping the Taiwanese company fine-tune its plans. “To safeguard everyone’s health and safety and comply with government virus prevention measures, we urge you not to return to Shenzhen,” Foxconn wrote in a Feb. 5 text message to employees based in the southern city. “As for the happy reunion date in Shenzhen, please wait for further notice.”
On last week’s call, Yang spoke in depth about Foxconn’s virus-prevention measures and the need to comply with various regulations in the so-called “iPhone city” of Zhengzhou -- just 300 miles from Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak -- covering infection-fighting measures from quarantines to face mask and hand sanitizer inventories. “If you are talking about tens of thousands of people in a line, in a building, in a campus and we try to prevent a virus -- and in the meantime you are asking for them to do their normal job -- that’s very challenging.”
Apple and Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., were among the first corporations to try and quantify the viral epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China, as well as dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, the Taiwanese company has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak could disrupt Chinese manufacturing and hence the world’s supply of electronics.
The disruptions extend well beyond electronics or technology. Many auto plants in the world’s largest market remain idled. Toyota Motor Corp., which initially halted its Chinese plants until Feb. 9, said Friday it now plans to resume production as soon as Feb. 17. Honda Motor Co. said it will reopen its factory in Hubei on Feb. 14 with an eye toward restarting output the week of Feb. 17. And Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also delayed the resumption of production at some of its Chinese businesses until Feb. 17.
Expect the “supply chain situation to get worse before getting better,” wrote Jeff Pu of GF Securities.
One thing in the industry’s favor is that the first half of the year is often a lull period for a consumer electronics sphere driven by holiday  sales and new iPhones in the fall. Yang stressed that the disruption was “manageable” and that Hon Hai would scramble to make up for any early 2020 production shortfall.
Several of the biggest names in tech including Sony Corp (T:6758). and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. have said they’ll restart production in China as scheduled. Production at Tesla  Inc.’s new Shanghai factory -- its first outside the U.S. -- resumed production on Feb. 10., it said.
But much depends on the extent and severity of the outbreak. Even if it peaks soon, the interconnectedness of just-in-time global supply means the entire system will go through an unprecedented upheaval. The shortage of just one component exerts a ripple effect on the entire chain by holding up production further down the line, rippling through the carefully choreographed networks that companies from Apple to Huawei Technologies Co. and display-maker BOE Technology Group Co. rely on.
“There will certainly be risks of on-site infections. Companies also do not have control over neighborhoods near their factories,” said Eric Tseng, chief executive officer of Taipei-based Isaiah Research. “Manpower levels for most manufacturers will still be low during the first two to three weeks of February due to the length of quarantines and the possibility that not many workers will return.”
If Supply Chain Must Face a Pandemic, Now’s the Time: Tim Culpan
Unlike in previous years, Foxconn hasn’t even begun the recruitment of the hundreds of thousands it employs annually to piece together gadgets like the  Sony Corp.  PlayStation and HP Inc . computers, according to people familiar with the matter. Local executives were awaiting clarity and trying to reconcile rapid-fire and sometimes conflicting virus-prevention measures announced by local governments.
As such, its main iPhone-making plant in Zhengzhou may start the week of Feb. 10 with just a small number of workers who didn’t decamp for their hometowns before the extended break, one of the people said. The majority of the plant’s workforce are expected to encounter immense travel obstacles, the person added, asking not to be identified talking about internal matters. Foxconn’s two biggest campuses in Shenzhen now also face a similar predicament given the warning to employees to stay away.
To make matters worse, the virus has shrunk the available labor pool. Foxconn will temporarily halt recruiting workers from Hubei, site of the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan, and other heavily affected areas in neighboring provinces, a second person said. It’s ordered workers currently in Hubei as well as from seven other cities in adjacent Henan, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces not to return to work, according to an internal document dated Feb. 4. obtained by Bloomberg. The company offered a 200 yuan ($28) reward to employees who report on co-workers violating that ban. While the picture remains murky, Foxconn is the most visible proxy for the confusion that now grips the broader supply chain.
More broadly, economists are still struggling to tote up the economic fallout of the outbreak. While SARS was bad economic news for China and its neighbors, which suffered from weaker exports and falling tourism, China’s small weight capped the global impact back then, when China’s GDP was 4% of the global total. That share now stands at 17%. That means, even if the outbreak peaks soon and producers impose double overtime to make up for lost production, the final end-demand in 2020 for gadgets of all stripes could take a severe beating.
At Huawei, China’s largest tech company and a global leader in smartphones and networking gear, executives are debating when to resume production for fear of angering Beijing by forcing large numbers of people into cramped dorms and factories, according to another person familiar with the matter. Then there’s the LCD makers from BOE to Tianma Microelectronics Co. that now crank out 50% or more of the screens for all TVs, phones and even car dashboards -- much of that from Wuhan.
The city is an important base for FiberHome and other optical fiber makers as well, that Huawei and networking firms rely on. “These will get directly hit,” said Kevin Chen, an analyst at China Merchants Securities. “ Near-term, their production will be impacted even if they resume working they might have a problem getting enough workers resulting in lower utilization.”"

Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a tweet called Aylward a “veteran of past public health emergencies.” An advance team left Geneva for China on Sunday, he said.
Aylward ran a review that led to the first system-wide activation procedures for major infectious disease emergencies, according to the WHO’s website.
WHO also will hold a global forum Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva to accelerate research into the coronavirus outbreak, Ghebreyesus said in a separate tweet.
China Cites Medical Gear in Merkel Call (2:15 p.m. NY)
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told German Chancellor Angela Merkel he hopes other nations will back his country’s efforts to fight the coronavirus and help his government buy medical supplies from Germany, Xinhua reported, citing a Sunday call between the leaders.
Li said China’s actions exceed recommendations of the World Health Organization. “The Chinese government and people are confident and capable of winning the fight against the epidemic,” he said, the state-run news agency reported.Merkel said that Germany is paying close attention and has taken a “prudent stance” in dealing with the epidemic, Xinhua said. Merkel said Germany has not imposed excessively restrictive measures.
China Rejects Virus Speculation (12:30 a.m. NY)
China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, dismissed suggestions the coronavirus originated from a military laboratory or was part of biological warfare research, and warned against such speculation.
“I think it’s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists, Chinese scientists, American scientists, scientists of other countries, are doing their best to learn more about the virus,” Cui said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” broadcast. “It’s very harmful, it’s very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people. For one thing, this will create panic. Another thing, that it will fan up racial discrimination, xenophobia.”
Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, last month in a tweet said Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, has China’s only laboratory that works with deadly pathogens including coronavirus.
Singaporean Cases (10 a.m. NY)
Singaporean health officials are trying to trace three new cases to see if they’re linked to previous infections or travel to mainland China. Of the 22 locally transmitted cases, investigations and contact tracing have found links between 15 of the cases with the three currently known clusters, health officials said Sunday in an emailed statement."

Tech producers led by Foxconn (TW:2354), which makes the majority of the world’s iPhones from Zhengzhou a few hundred miles from the coronavirus outbreak’s epicenter, had begun preparing investors for the potential bedlam when hundreds of thousands make their way back to factories.

Apple Inc s  most important partner warned investors of the daunting task of securing enough workers despite widespread transport blockades, quarantining thousands, and the “nightmare” scenario of an on-campus epidemic that could shut down production altogether. Last week, it took the unprecedented step of warning workers to stay away from its Shenzhen headquarters till further notice as government inspectors vet its containment procedures, Bloomberg News reported.
“How we can make sure there will be no infection within our campuses will be the first priority, because if you put a lot of people together and one of them gets infected, that will be a nightmare,” Foxconn investor relations chief Alex Yang told investors on a Thursday call, according to a recording obtained by Bloomberg News. “We try very hard to make sure the possibility of any on-site infection will be as low as zero, although it will be challenging.”
The deadly virus has illustrated the increasingly central role China plays in global manufacturing, from clothing and chemicals to automobiles and especially technology. Just about every major piece of consumer electronics is made in China, from iPhones and gaming consoles to half the world’s liquid crystal display or LCD screens. The contagion has already shuttered plants across China for a week longer than anticipated after the Lunar New Year break -- a disruption that could get much worse if rolling quarantines and suspended rail and air links prevent the return of the millions of blue-collar laborers at the heart of electronics assembly.
When they do make it back, untold numbers will get funneled into a quarantine of up to two weeks -- a sequester of unknown scale. Any disruptions at Chinese plants can, in a worst-case scenario, freeze parts of the supply chain by triggering cascading shortages. Influential supply chain analyst Kuo Ming-chi of TF International estimates Foxconn’s main iPhone-making base will properly resume work only next week -- and then at 40% to 60% capacity.  Citigroup   estimates just 30% of the entire Chinese semiconductor workforce is estimated to return to their workplaces as of Feb 11.
Foxconn said in a statement Saturday it’s working with local governments to prepare for the return of employees, without specifics. Shenzhen’s Longhua district said in a WeChat post it was helping the Taiwanese company fine-tune its plans. “To safeguard everyone’s health and safety and comply with government virus prevention measures, we urge you not to return to Shenzhen,” Foxconn wrote in a Feb. 5 text message to employees based in the southern city. “As for the happy reunion date in Shenzhen, please wait for further notice.”
On last week’s call, Yang spoke in depth about Foxconn’s virus-prevention measures and the need to comply with various regulations in the so-called “iPhone city” of Zhengzhou -- just 300 miles from Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak -- covering infection-fighting measures from quarantines to face mask and hand sanitizer inventories. “If you are talking about tens of thousands of people in a line, in a building, in a campus and we try to prevent a virus -- and in the meantime you are asking for them to do their normal job -- that’s very challenging.”
Apple and Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., were among the first corporations to try and quantify the viral epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China, as well as dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, the Taiwanese company has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak could disrupt Chinese manufacturing and hence the world’s supply of electronics.
The disruptions extend well beyond electronics or technology. Many auto plants in the world’s largest market remain idled. Toyota Motor Corp., which initially halted its Chinese plants until Feb. 9, said Friday it now plans to resume production as soon as Feb. 17. Honda Motor Co. said it will reopen its factory in Hubei on Feb. 14 with an eye toward restarting output the week of Feb. 17. And Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also delayed the resumption of production at some of its Chinese businesses until Feb. 17.
Expect the “supply chain situation to get worse before getting better,” wrote Jeff Pu of GF Securities.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
Hon Hai, ZTE (HK:0763) and Quanta may not recover as quickly as electronics makers did after the SARS outbreak. China’s growth may slow further and 5G phone sales could disappoint as they don’t seem to have the features that drive widespread consumer upgrades.
- Charles Shum, BI technology analyst
One thing in the industry’s favor is that the first half of the year is often a lull period for a consumer electronics sphere driven by holiday sales and new iPhones in the fall. Yang stressed that the disruption was “manageable” and that Hon Hai would scramble to make up for any early 2020 production shortfall.

Several of the biggest names in tech including   Sony Corp.   (T:6758) and   Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   (KS:005930) have said they’ll restart production in China as scheduled. Production at Tesla  Inc.’s new Shanghai factory -- its first outside the U.S. -- resumed on Feb. 10., it said. And Apple-assembler   Pegatron   Corp (TW:4938) on Monday said it’s gradually restarting operations.
But much depends on the extent and severity of the outbreak. Even if it peaks soon, the interconnectedness of just-in-time global supply means the entire system will go through an unprecedented upheaval. The shortage of just one component exerts a ripple effect on the entire chain by holding up production further down the line, rippling through the carefully choreographed networks that companies from Apple to Huawei Technologies Co. and display-maker BOE Technology Group Co. rely on.
“There will certainly be risks of on-site infections. Companies also do not have control over neighborhoods near their factories,” said Eric Tseng, chief executive officer of Taipei-based Isaiah Research. “Manpower levels for most manufacturers will still be low during the first two to three weeks of February due to the length of quarantines and the possibility that not many workers will return.”
If Supply Chain Must Face a Pandemic, Now’s the Time: Tim Culpan
Unlike in previous years, Foxconn hasn’t even begun the recruitment of the hundreds of thousands it employs annually to piece together gadgets like the Sony Corp. PlayStation and HP Inc . computers, according to people familiar with the matter. Local executives were awaiting clarity and trying to reconcile rapid-fire and sometimes conflicting virus-prevention measures announced by local governments.
As such, its main iPhone-making plant in Zhengzhou may start the week of Feb. 10 with just a small number of workers who didn’t decamp for their hometowns before the extended break, one of the people said. The majority of the plant’s workforce are expected to encounter immense travel obstacles, the person added, asking not to be identified talking about internal matters. Foxconn’s two biggest campuses in Shenzhen now also face a similar predicament given the warning to employees to stay away.
To make matters worse, the virus has shrunk the available labor pool. Foxconn will temporarily halt recruiting workers from Hubei, site of the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan, and other heavily affected areas in neighboring provinces, a second person said. It’s ordered workers currently in Hubei as well as from seven other cities in adjacent Henan, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces not to return to work, according to an internal document dated Feb. 4. obtained by Bloomberg. The company offered a 200 yuan ($28) reward to employees who report on co-workers violating that ban. While the picture remains murky, Foxconn is the most visible proxy for the confusion that now grips the broader supply chain.
More broadly, economists are still struggling to tote up the economic fallout of the outbreak. While SARS was bad economic news for China and its neighbors, which suffered from weaker exports and falling tourism, China’s small weight capped the global impact back then, when China’s GDP was 4% of the global total. That share now stands at 17%. That means, even if the outbreak peaks soon and producers impose double overtime to make up for lost production, the final end-demand in 2020 for gadgets of all stripes could take a severe beating.
At Huawei, China’s largest tech company and a global leader in smartphones and networking gear, executives are debating when to resume production for fear of angering Beijing by forcing large numbers of people into cramped dorms and factories, according to another person familiar with the matter. Then there’s the LCD makers from BOE to Tianma Microelectronics Co. that now crank out 50% or more of the screens for all TVs, phones and even car dashboards -- much of that from Wuhan."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China s smartphone sales may plunge by as much as 50% in the first quarter, as many retail shops have closed for an extended period and production has yet to fully resume due to the fast spread of a new coronavirus, according to research reports.
The virus outbreak, which has killed more than 900 people and roiled China s manufacturing industry, comes as top smartphone vendors such as Huawei had hoped China s 5G rollout plans this year would help the world s biggest smartphone market rebound after years of falling sales.
""Vendors  planned product launches will be canceled or delayed, given that large public events are not allowed in China,"" research firm Canalys said in a note last week.
""It will take time for vendors to change their product launch roadmaps in China, which is likely to dampen 5G shipments.""
Canalys expects China s smartphone shipments to halve in the first quarter from a year ago, while IDC, another research firm that tracks the tech sector, forecasts a 30% drop.
Apple Inc  said last week it is extending its retail store closures in China and has yet to finalise opening dates, as Foxconn, which assembles iPhones, struggles to fully resume factories.
Foxconn received government approval on Monday to resume production at a plant in the city of Zhenghzou, but its major plant in Shenzhen remain unopened.
Huawei, China s biggest smartphone vendor, said its manufacturing capacity is ""running normally"" without specifying further. But like many other local peers, Huawei relies heavily on third-party manufacturers for production.
If factories cannot resume production to full capacity on time, this could delay brands  ability to bring their newest products to market, analysts said.
Xiaomi Corp, Huawei, and Oppo, three of China s top Android brands, are all expected to announce flagship devices in the first half.
Oppo told Reuters that while the impact of the virus will affect operations at some local factories, ""manufacturing capacity can be guaranteed effectively"" thanks to its plants overseas.
Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment.
""The delays in reopening factories and the labour return time will not only affect shipments to stores, it will also affect the product launch times in the mid- and long-term,"" Will Wong, an IDC analyst, said.
Globally, smartphone production will decrease by 12% in the March quarter to a five-year low of 275 million units, research firm TrendForce said on Monday. It revised down iPhone production by 10% to 41 million units, while Huawei s output forecast was cut by 15% to 42.5 million phones."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open marginally higher Monday, rebounding after Friday’s losses which bucked an otherwise strong week. But these gains are likely to be limited as China’s coronavirus outbreak continues to claim victims and cause economic damage.

At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 100 up 16 points, or 0.2%, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract rose 8 points, or 0.1%. 
On Friday, both the S&P 500 cash index and the Nasdaq closed down 0.5%, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9%. However, despite these losses, the Dow posted its best weekly gain since August last year, the S&P since June, and the Nasdaq had its strongest week since November 2018.
This provides some room for investors to take profits, particularly as the earnings season starts to draw to a close. There are just 68 S&P 500 companies reporting results in the week ahead, with numbers from Restaurant Brands International, Allergan  and Loews  set to capture the market s attention on Monday.

Additionally, shares in Tesla  soared 9% premarket, continuing the stock’s recent volatile run, after the electric car maker reopened its $2 billion Shanghai production facility Monday. Factory restarts across China have been in doubt after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
A large number of China’s workers travelled back to offices and factories around the country, but many workplaces still remained closed, including key Apple  supplier Foxconn that had sought official permission to open, while many white-collar workers continued to work from home. 
The death toll from the disease has officially overtaken that of the SARS outbreak almost two decades ago, as China reported the total number of deaths at 910, with over 40,000 people affected.
The death of a whistleblower doctor last week and the disappearance of citizen journalists in Wuhan who were reporting on the outbreak have also raised suspicions that the scale of the outbreak may be being understated.
The toll on China s already-slowing economy has been heavy, with Goldman Sachs  cutting its first quarter GDP target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying an even deeper hit is possible.

U.S. economic releases are thin on the ground Monday, so focus could be on speeches from Federal Reserve members Michelle Bowman and Patrick Harker. These come ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivering his semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The Fed chair is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold given that the labor market continues to tighten and private consumption growth remains solid.
Elsewhere, oil headed lower Monday, continuing last week’s losses when the complex posted its fifth weekly loss in a row. Doubts remain over the extent of production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+. "

(Bloomberg) --   Hon Hai   Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) has told some employees at its main iPhone-making unit that it’s postponing the resumption of production, a sign of the struggles Apple Inc. s  primary partner is having with the novel coronavirus.
Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, sent a message via its internal app on Sunday that it wouldn’t be able to decide on a back-to-work date “until further notice” for its iDPBG business unit, according to a version reviewed by Bloomberg News. That division makes gadgets for Apple at a factory in the so-called iPhone city of Zhengzhou in central China and two other plants in Shenzhen. It’s not clear how many employees received the message and whether other workers were summoned back.
Foxconn declined to comment on the message and said on Monday its factories will comply with government requirements, and resume output in an “orderly manner” by staggering the return of workers.
The internal directive is bound to fuel more confusion over when the assembler of electronics to most of the world’s largest tech brands will fire up its factories. Foxconn has told employees at its southern Shenzhen headquarters not to return to work when the extended Lunar New Year break ended Feb. 10, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg.
Not all of its employees returned to their hometowns for the holiday break so there’s still some available workers on production sites, according to people familiar with the plant operations. But it’s unclear as to how many such workers are on hand.
The unit could also struggle to hire back workers after the holiday period. A recruitment app for iDPBG shows that two of its plants in Shenzhen had received only 800 applications from former workers as of Monday morning. The facilities are seeking as many as 3,000 ex-workers."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple s biggest iPhone maker Foxconn (TW:2317) got approval to resume production at a key plant in China after being forced to shut it following the coronavirus outbreak, but only 10% of the factory s workforce has managed to return so far, a source told Reuters.
Taiwan s Foxconn, the world s largest contract electronics maker, got the green light to restart production in the eastern central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, said the person with direct knowledge of the matter. The company, however, has not yet been allowed to restart production in Shenzhen, a southern manufacturing hub, the source said.
The two factories together make up the bulk of Foxconn s assembly lines for Apple s  iPhones, and the delays are likely to impact global shipments.
Market research firm Trendforce on Monday cut its March-quarter forecast for iPhone production by about 10% to 41 million handsets.
Apple itself gave a wider-than-usual revenue outlook range for the March quarter last month to factor in uncertainty due to the virus that has claimed more than 900 lives and infected over 40,000 people.
An Apple spokeswoman in Shanghai was not immediately available for comment.
Apple rival and China s biggest smartphone maker, Huawei, said last week it had resumed production of consumer devices and carrier equipment, and operations were running normally.
About 16,000 people, or under 10% of Foxconn s workforce in Zhengzhou have returned to the plant, the source said, adding that company executives were trying very hard to negotiate with authorities to resume production in other parts of China, including Kunshan, in southeastern Jiangsu province.
""Our request to resume production (in Shenzhen) was disapproved. We need to improve our virus control measures for another check,"" said the person who declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.
Shenzhen authorities will conduct checks at the plant again later this week, the person said.
Employees in Shenzhen were told not to return to work on Tuesday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
The coronavirus outbreak - declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization - has disrupted Chinese manufacturing and forced companies such as  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) to halt production of cars in some factories.
Some companies including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) limped back to work on Monday but hundreds of factories and stores remain shut across China.
Foxconn, formally  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a statement that employee safety was top priority and that it was working with authorities to meet requirements to resume production across China ""in a staggered and orderly manner"".
Foxconn employees who returned to work on Monday following an extended Lunar New Year holiday have been told to wear masks, undergo temperature checks and adhere to a specified dining system, according to internal memos seen by Reuters.
Most senior Taiwanese officials have been told to refrain from returning to China and those who needed to do so required approval from Chairman Liu Young-Way, the person said.
Foxconn, which makes devices for global electronics firms, has built its own production lines in the southern province of Guangdong to make masks for its hundreds of thousands of employees, targeting two million masks a day by late February, the memos showed.
The company reported an 11.96% drop in its January revenue from a year ago to T$364.6 billion ($12.12 billion), according to a Foxconn filing to the Taiwan stock exchange. It did not give further details."

Arm, which provides chip technology to mobile phone semiconductor suppliers like Qualcomm  and end device makers like Apple , has been diversifying its customer base in recent years to markets such as self-driving cars.
It has also expanded to target areas like the ""internet of things"" - in which many everyday devices such as traffic lights or agricultural irrigation systems will be fitted with internet-connected sensors and automated.
Arm on Monday released the new Cortex M55 processor paired with what it calls its Ethos-U55 ""neural processing unit.""
Chips with the technology will hit the market in 2021 and aim to carry out the special kinds of math needed by artificial intelligence (AI) software that can detect vibrations or pick out spoken keywords from a user.
The chips are designed to function with very low amounts of electricity. That allows devices such as sensors to last for years at a time on a small battery and to only connect to the internet when needed.
Minimizing internet connections can help protect privacy by processing data locally and sending only what is needed to remote servers while discarding the rest, Arm executives said.
Many fields such as health care will require data to be processed locally, with little or none of the results sent back to remote servers, Dipti Vachani, senior vice president and general manager of Arm s automotive and internet of things line of business, told Reuters.

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Wall Street edged higher at the opening on Monday, reversing earlier losses on continued fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the world economy, amidst reports that China’s factories were slow to return to work after a lengthy and enforce New Year holiday.
By 10:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 80 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.4%, all seemingly content to await congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday and Wednesday before committing to any bigger moves.
Uncertainty was the watchword on Monday, owing to the difficulty of forming a coherent picture of how quickly China’s factories and shops can return to anything like their pre-holiday level of activity.
Apple  stock, for example, fell 0.6% amid conflicting reports about the reopening of factories belonging to Hon Hai Precision – also known as Foxconn – where the bulk of iPhones are made.
Reuters reported that Foxconn had reopened factories with staffing levels at around 10% of normal, while Bloomberg reported that the company had sent a message to staff on its internal app saying that it couldn’t give a date for the resumption of production.
Market research firm Trendforce said on Monday it had cut its forecast for iPhone production by about 10% to 41 million handsets for the three months through March. The only bright spot for Apple  is that the first quarter of the calendar year is in any case normally the slowest.
Tesla  stock leaped 4.9% but was off intraday highs after a highly speculative analysis in Forbes touting a possible takeover by Alphabet . Additionally, initial enthusiasm about the partial reopening of its Shanghai plant gave way to the realization that production – and cash flow – may take weeks if not months to ramp up fully. Reports suggested that the ramp up at Tesla and elsewhere will be delayed by the quarantining of laborers who return from holidays from other parts of the country.
Chinese state media on Monday ran an interview with a leading local virologist suggesting that the incubation period for the coronavirus could be as much as 24 days, rather than the 14 reported hitherto.
Elswhere among individual stocks on Monday, struggling mall operator Taubman Centers  stock rose 53% after rival Simon Property  offered to buy one-third of the Taubman family stake in a deal that values the group at $3.6 billion including debt. The deal still needs approval from Taubman’s free shareholders.
  Exxon Mobil    stock dipped back towards a new 10-year low again as U.S. crude futures tumbled below $50 a barrel again on growing fears that OPEC and its ally Russia aren’t acting to stop a new glut forming on world markets as Chinese demand collapses.
Stocks also came under pressure from the strengthening dollar, which hit its highest level since October against developed-market peers, including a four-month high against the euro."

The unit could also struggle to hire back workers after the holiday period. A recruitment app for iDPBG shows that two of its plants in Shenzhen had received only 800 applications from former workers as of Monday morning. The facilities are seeking as many as 3,000 ex-workers.
Apple and Foxconn were among the first corporations to try and quantify the epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain as well as weaker consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, Foxconn has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak is disrupting Chinese manufacturing and the world’s supply of electronics.

AMS, best known for supplying Apple s  iPhones with facial recognition technology, wants to form a global player in sensors and lights with its takeover of the leading manufacturer of car headlamps.
Having secured nearly 60% of Osram s shares in December, taking on debt of 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) to finance the deal, AMS gained shareholder approval for a 1.7 billion euro capital increase to help to fund the acquisition of the much bigger German group.
A domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (DPLTA) would give AMS full say over Osram s finances and allow it to consolidate the company s cash flow.
To clinch the agreement AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke needs approval from 75% of Osram investors at an extraordinary shareholder meeting.
""We intend to implement a DPLTA to enable both companies to work together and realize our joint strategic vision of creating a global leader in sensor solutions and photonics in an efficient manner,"" AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke said in a statement on Monday.
Until now AMS has told investors there might be a way to pay back debt and achieve targeted integration benefits of 300 million euros ($327 million), though analysts have been skeptical.
The Austrian company would have to offer the remaining minority investors two alternatives: either pay them an annual guaranteed dividend or a cash settlement."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record highs on Monday as Chinese workers and factories slowly returned to business following a Lunar New Year holiday that was protracted by the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
All three major U.S. stock averages advanced in a broad-based rally, boosted by index leaders Amazon.com ,  Microsoft Corp   and Alphabet  Inc.
Worries over the coronavirus kept market participants on edge, with the death toll rising to 908 and the World Health Organization (WHO) warning that new cases outside of China could be ""the spark that becomes a bigger fire.""
But generally upbeat earnings, positive economic data and China s recent stimulus have attracted buyers to the U.S. equities market. 
""The money that China injected into its economy is finding its way around the world and you have a ""buy anything and everything  mentality,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""It s an index buy and it s growth verses value.""
""The U.S. is seeing some economic growth,"" Nolte added. ""We re the cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry, globally, and it gives investors another reason to buy U.S. stocks."" 
Tesla  Inc s stock rose 3.1% after its Shanghai factory resumed production, and iPhone maker Foxconn re-started a key plant in China with 10% of its workforce.
That is cold comfort for Apple , whose iPhone sales in China could plunge by as much as 50% due to the virus, according to analysts.
The fast-spreading coronavirus has now caused more deaths than the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, and has affected a broad range of companies and sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 174.31 points, or 0.6%, to 29,276.82, the S&P 500 gained 24.39 points, or 0.73%, to 3,352.1 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.88 points, or 1.13%, to 9,628.39.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 all but energy ended the session in the black, with technology and consumer discretionary shares posting the largest percentage gains.
Fourth-quarter reporting season is approaching the final reel, with 324 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 70.7% have beat Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now see aggregate year-on-year fourth-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, a reversal from the 0.3% decline analysts projected on Jan 1.

The S&P 500 Index rose to a new high Monday, with most sectors advancing. Energy company shares proved the exception, declining as West Texas crude fell below $50 a barrel. Treasuries and European bonds edged higher, and the dollar held steady versus a basket of its major peers.
Asia’s main equity gauges fell everywhere apart from Shanghai. Traders monitored the restart of Chinese factories and the possible chaos that may ensue as several hundred thousand people begin returning to work at companies like Apple Inc . supplier Foxconn. General Motors Co . will restart production in China beginning Feb. 15.
With cases of the coronavirus outside of China on the rise and various companies pulling back from international meetings, investors are trying to figure out whether the rate of contagion is stabilizing. In the meantime, monetary authorities across emerging markets have stepped in to help shore up the financial system. The People’s Bank of China moved to keep liquidity ample Monday through reverse-repurchase agreements.
“As disconcerting as the spread of the coronavirus has been to date, the global focus on the illness is likely to produce a solution to stem its spread before long,” John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, wrote in a note. “Economic data released last week underscored strength and resilience in the U.S. labor market and pointed toward the sustainability of the U.S. economic expansion.”
The euro declined after the region was buffeted by political headlines. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s succession plan collapsed, and polls put Sinn Fein in place for a possible role in Ireland’s government, depressing the country’s banking stocks. European equities closed higher.
Earnings are due this week from major names like  Alibaba   Group Holding Ltd.,  Credit Suisse   Group AG and Nestle SA .
Elsewhere, emerging-market currencies steadied against the dollar. Bitcoin traded just below $10,000, having risen above that mark over the weekend for the first time since October.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday denied a request by Apple Inc  that it reconsider a decision upholding a finding Apple iPhones infringed VirnetX Holding Corp patents relating to secure communications technology.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declined to reconsider a split decision it issued on Nov. 22 in the long-running litigation.
In the November ruling, a three-judge panel of the court voided a jury’s calculation that Apple should pay $503 million for infringing VirnetX patents. 
But in a partial victory for VirnetX, the Federal Circuit left in place a Texas jury’s finding that some versions of the iPhone infringed two VirnetX patents, setting the stage for another trial.

Apple had urged all of the judges sitting on the court to reconsider that part of the three-judge panel s decision."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) is set to unveil a new, square-shaped foldable smartphone and updated versions of its flagship Galaxy S range on Tuesday, seeking to revive sales after ceding its smartphone crown to Apple Inc  last quarter.
Ahead of the launch event in San Francisco, Samsung in a surprise U.S. TV commercial on Sunday gave a first glimpse of the new square phones that fold like flip phones and show off a notification panel on the exterior.
The Galaxy Z Flip is expected to be cheaper than the bulky $1,980 Galaxy Fold that opens like a book, partly due to a more compact screen size, analysts and sources said.
While the South Korean firm hopes the new handset will help burnish its innovation credentials, consumers will be keen to see whether Samsung has overcome technological challenges and screen glitches that forced it to delay the Galaxy Fold last year.
""Foldables are expensive and very hard to manufacture. It will take time for foldables to become mass-market products,"" said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics, expecting a mass-market takeoff by 2022 or 2023.
""For now, foldables are a super-premium product that can drive profits or a  halo effect  for the Samsung brand.""
Limited foldable display productivity and capacity will constrain Samsung s ability to boost the foldable phone production sharply, industry officials and analysts say.
Sales are seen at 5 million units at maximum this year, or less than 2% of Samsung s total smartphone shipments in 2019, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Samsung declined to comment.
Samsung is also expected to launch three variants of Galaxy S premium smartphones, whose sales are expected to exceed that of predecessors, helped by competitive pricing and powerful cameras, researcher Counterpoint said.
Samsung lost its No.1 smartphone position to Apple in the December quarter, according to Strategy Analytics as cheaper iPhone 11 pricing helped the U.S. firm enjoy its best growth performance since 2015.
While China s coronavirus outbreak has started straining the global supply chain and disrupting smartphone production, the South Korean firm is seen the least affected among major producers, as its main manufacturing base is in Vietnam, analysts said.
Research firm TrendForce forecasts global smartphone production will decrease by 12% in the first quarter to a five-year low but cut its production estimate for Samsung by just 3%."

President Donald Trump said he believes warm weather will curb the spread of the disease, as the U.S. reported a 13th infection.
Key Developments

China Home Sales Plunge Due to Virus (1:29 p.m. HK)
Home sales in China have been dealt a huge blow by the spreading coronavirus, with figures showing transactions plunged in the first week of February. New apartment sales dropped 90% from the same period of 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co. Sales of existing homes plummeted 91% in eight cities where data is available.
CDC Confirms 13th Case in the U.S. (11:38 a.m. HK)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed another case of coronavirus in California, bringing the number in the U.S. to 13.
The latest patient is in San Diego, and was among citizens evacuated from Wuhan to the U.S. and under quarantine. The CDC said it is conducting an investigation to determine the patient’s contacts and assess if they had high risk exposure.
Trump Sees Warm Weather Curbing Outbreak (11:31 a.m. HK)
The U.S. has about a dozen people suffering from the coronavirus but all are expected to recover, U.S. President Donald Trump said.
Trump, speaking to Fox Business Network on Monday, said he believes warm weather will curb the spread of the disease beginning in April, and that Chinese authorities have the outbreak under control.
“I really believe that they’re going to have it under control fairly soon,” he said.
Hong Kong Won’t Enact Mask Laws (11:12 a.m. HK)
Hong Kong authorities have no plans to enact laws regulating the city’s supply of surgical masks, Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters at a weekly briefing.
Lam has faced criticism from the public in recent days as a mask shortage sent people scrambling to form long lines at pharmacies, while residents distrustful of her administration after months of pro-democracy protests staged a run on toilet paper. She urged Hong Kongers to reduce their number of social interactions as the city works to ward off a wider outbreak.
“We are making an appeal to people of Hong Kong to stay at home as much as possible,” she said. “This means they should avoid some social interactions, participation in social activities and family reunion and friends meeting.”
She said the government wasn’t calling for compusory closures, “because Hong Kong is a free society” and business operators were already taking strong precautionary measures.
Philippine Carriers Suspend Taiwan Flights (11:03 a.m. HK)
Philippine Airlines Inc. and Cebu Air Inc. have suspended their Taiwan flights after the Philippines expanded its travel ban on the novel coronavirus. The order temporarily barring the entry and departure of foreign nationals from China, Hong Kong and Macau will also cover Taiwan, the Bureau of Immigration said. Both carriers suspended the Taiwan flights starting Tuesday.
Intel Pulls Out of Mobile World Congress (10:52 a.m. HK)
 Intel Corp  . joins the list of major tech companies bailing on the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona later this month, the world’s biggest mobile tech exhibition.
“We have withdrawn from this year’s Mobile World Congress out of an abundance of caution,” Intel said in a statement.
Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) AB, Sony Corp (T:6758). and Nvidia Corp. are among the other big exhibitors who have elected to not attend MWC 2020 to avoid health risks to employees.
Singapore Sees Up to 30% Drop in Tourism (10:32 a.m. HK)
Singapore could see a 25% to 30% decline in tourist arrivals and spending this year because of the coronavirus outbreak, as the industry braces for a worse impact than the 2003 SARS pandemic, the city’s tourism chief said.
The city-state is losing about 18,000 to 20,000 tourists a day, and the figures could plummet further if the situation persists for longer, Keith Tan, chief executive of Singapore Tourism Board, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
China accounts for about 20% of Singapore’s tourism intake, the biggest source of visitors ahead of Indonesia and India. China’s ban on outbound tour groups and Singapore’s move to bar Chinese nationals from entering has led to an “evaporation” of a key source of revenue, Tan said.
China’s Hubei Province Removes Top Health Officials (9:04 a.m. HK)
China’s Hubei province at the center of the virus outbreak has removed health commission head Liu Yingzi and party chief Zhang Jin from their posts, state-run CCTV reported.
Criticism has mounted over China’s transparency and speed in handling the epidemic. The government’s struggle to stem the outbreak has fueled concerns about President Xi Jinping’s efforts to centralize power since taking office, with officials pointing fingers over who’s to blame for the spread of the illness.
The death last week of a 34-year-old doctor, Li Wenliang, who was sanctioned by local authorities after warning about the disease, unleashed a torrent of grief and anger on social media.
Thailand Says Ship Won’t Be Allowed to Disembark (8:56 a.m. HK)
Passengers from a ship that has been blocked from other ports due to virus concerns won’t be given permission to disembark in Thailand, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook  posting.
The Westerdam cruise ship, operated by Carnival  Corp.’s Holland America, has been refused entry by a number of nations over fears that passengers may be carrying the coronavirus.
The ship departed Hong Kong on Feb. 1 with 1,455 passengers and 802 crew. It is set to arrive at a port near Bangkok on Thursday, and checks with health authorities indicate there is “no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board the ship,” Holland America said in a statement Monday.
Elderly May Be Released From Japan Ship: Kyodo (8:32 a.m. HK)
The Japanese government may allow senior citizens and people with chronic illnesses to leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship on Tuesday morning, Kyodo news reported, citing people it didn’t identify.
The number of coronavirus infections among those aboard the Carnival Corp. ship quarantined off Yokohama has nearly doubled to 135, making it the biggest center of infection of any place outside of China.
Risks are mounting that the virus could spread further in the confined spaces of the ship, where many onboard have increased vulnerability due to their advanced ages.
Hong Kong Public Housing Residents Evacuated (8:30 a.m. HK)
More than 100 people at a public housing estate in Hong Kong were evacuated in the early hours of Tuesday after two people in the tower were confirmed to have contracted the novel coronavirus, South China Morning Post reported.
The move was precautionary after a 62-year-old woman, who lives several floors directly below a man who had earlier confirmed with the virus infection, became the 42nd cases in Hong Kong, according to the report.
China Death Toll at 1,016 (8:17 a.m. HK)
The death toll in China from the coronavirus rose to 1,016, with the addition of 108 fatalities for Feb. 10, according to the National Health Commission. Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, reported 103 more deaths, its highest daily count so far.
While the total confirmed cases in mainland China climbed to 42,638, Hubei reported 2,097 new infections, the smallest daily increase since Feb. 1.
Most cases and deaths in China are in Hubei. Large parts of the province have been cut off from the rest of China since the government started imposing a quarantine on Jan. 23 to try and stop the spread of the virus.
Two additional deaths have occurred outside of mainland China: one in Hong Kong and the other in the Philippines.
Ford Reopens China Plants (11:30 a.m. NY)
Ford Motor  Co. has resumed production at its Chinese plants, a spokesman said.
The U.S. automaker is working with its supplier partners, some of which are located in Hubei province, to assess and plan for parts supply, according to Anderson Chan, a spokesman.
Ford was among the major automakers that halted production at China plants late last month as the government extended the traditional Lunar New Year holiday by a week.
Tesla  Inc. also reopened its plant near Shanghai on Monday.
New Estimate Puts Virus Death Rate at 1% (10:37 a.m. NY)
The mortality rate from the coronavirus is an estimated 1%, researchers at the Imperial College London said in a new report that attempts to account for mild cases as well as more severe ones at the center of the outbreak in China.
Researchers have been trying to estimate how severe the virus is, and to calculate how fast it spreads as well as how many people get severe illnesses or die. In China’s Hubei province, where the outbreak began, the fatality rate may be 18% for patients with severe symptoms, the researchers calculated.
“The impact of the unfolding epidemic may be comparable to the major influenza pandemics of the twentieth century,” Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease researcher at Imperial College London, said in a statement.
The researchers said the 1% mortality rate was an estimate of what will happen once all cases are counted, and after previously undiagnosed ones drive the rate down.
Any estimates ”should be viewed cautiously” given the numerous uncertainties involved, the researchers warned in in their report. Mortality rates tend to shift in the middle of an outbreak as new and milder cases are found.
The U.K. researchers estimated that the typical time between onset of symptoms and death has been about 22 days, meaning that there may be a multiweek time lag between reporting of cases and when deaths from those cases become apparent.
Overall, the Imperial College London researchers estimated that 1.3% of Wuhan residents were infected with the virus as of Jan. 31, but only 1 in 19 of them were being tested for the virus – suggesting that the actual number of cases could be far higher than the official numbers indicate.
Toymaker: Closing May Hurt Holiday Sales (10:15 a.m. NY)
The CEO of one the world’s largest toymakers said many of its largest Chinese suppliers remain shuttered because of the coronavirus outbreak, with some pushing reopening dates back to the end of next month.
“It’s bad,” said Isaac Larian, who also founded closely held MGA Entertainment Inc. “People don’t realize. This won’t just affect the toy business; it’s going to have a major economic effect worldwide.”
While the idled factories haven’t had a major impact on MGA so far, prolonged closings could delay orders for the holiday-shopping season, according to Larian. China is by far the biggest maker of toys, with the industry’s hub in Shenzhen, and February and March is when factories do the bulk of production for Christmas goods that hit shelves beginning in late October.
U.K. Issues Tighter Quarantine Rules (9:55 a.m. NY)
Britain imposed new regulations allowing health authorities to keep individuals in quarantine if they’re considered to be at risk of infecting others. The move came as the U.K. government called the novel coronavirus a “serious and imminent” threat to public health.
The rules apply to anyone seeking to leave isolation before a 14-day quarantine is complete and will be in place for future cases, the government said Monday. Four more patients in England tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the U.K. to eight. The country has also flown back Britons from the virus epicenter of Wuhan, China, and they’re now being held in quarantine.
China’s Xi Makes Public Appearance (6:20 a.m. NY)
Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first public appearance after the death of a doctor who became a hero for speaking out about the deadly coronavirus sparked public anger.
Xi visited the Chaoyang district in Beijing Monday afternoon “to learn about the situation of epidemic prevision and control at the grassroots level,” according to state-run media Xinhua. The agency published photos of Xi wearing a mask and having his temperature taken.
It was the first time Xi interacted with the public since a trip to Yunnan province from Jan. 19 to Jan. 21, part of a tradition the country’s leaders have of touring smaller towns and cities ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday. The president was last seen in public when he met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Feb. 5.

(Reuters) - Consumers love streamed TV and film and want content providers to keep it coming, a new survey from U.S. data and measurement firm Nielsen suggests.
In a survey it conducted for its latest Total Audience Report, Nielsen found that, even as the number of streaming services rise, 93% of respondents would keep paying for the ones they have or subscribe to others.
Technology and media investors fear the market may be becoming too crowded to accommodate new services. But the Nielsen survey suggests consumers will keep signing up. 
In 2019, the U.S. audience could choose from over 646,000 different titles across traditional broadcast TV and streaming platforms, up nearly 10% from 2018, according to Nielsen. Of those, about 9% were only available on a streaming service such as Netflix , Walt  Disney   Co s Disney+, Apple  Inc s Apple TV+ or ViacomCBS s CBS All Access.
Streaming is particularly popular among young adults. Among 18- to 34-year-olds who participated in the Nielsen survey, 96% subscribe to a paid streaming video service, compared to 91% among all consumers of all ages. 

Nearly one-third of all respondents and almost half of respondents aged 18 to 34 say they subscribe to three or more paid services - leaving plenty of room for AT&T- owned WarnerMedia s HBO Max and Comcast s Peacock streaming services, which are launching this year. "

Adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) were at $184.3 million and revenue reached $655 million in the three months through December, the Austrian group which is about to take over Germany s Osram said on Tuesday. The adjusted EBIT margin was at 28%.
AMS, generating a large chunk of revenue with sensors for Apple s iPhones, had guided for $610-$650 million in revenues in the fourth quarter and an EBIT margin of at least 28%.
Shares in AMS were up 5.13% in JB premarket trade.
Assuming no meaningful negative impact from the coronavirus outbreak, AMS expects revenue in the first quarter to ease to$480-520 million due to usual weak demand at the start of the year. The EBIT margin is seen to fall to 19-21%.
AMS has no production facilities in China, but supply chain disruptions in the country due to the new virus could hit its business. Analysts estimate that China s smartphone sales may plunge by as much as 50% in the first quarter, as many retail shops have closed for an extended period.
Apple  said last week it was extending its retail store closures in China and has yet to finalize opening dates, as Foxconn, which assembles iPhones, struggles to fully resume work.
AMS s fourth quarter operating cash flow was $273.5 million and net debt amounted to $1.75 billion per end-December, it said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Blix, which sued Apple Inc  for excluding its BlueMail product from the Mac app store, said on Tuesday that it was being allowed back in the digital shop.
After BlueMail was removed from the app store eight months ago, Blix filed a lawsuit against Apple that accused the hardware giant of infringing its patented technology and abusing its dominance in the app store.
Blix, which was founded by Ben and Dan Volach, had reached out to other app developers to encourage them to work together to counter Apple s considerable power.
""When we wrote to Apple’s developer community, BlueMail was back on the App Store within a week,"" said Dan Volach, co-founder at Blix. ""If you’re out there too scared to come forward, let this be your proof that speaking out works.""
Apple has said that Blix updated the BlueMail software, which Apple had said would potentially expose users  computers to malware and threaten the users  privacy. This security issue was the only reason the BlueMail software was excluded from the Mac app store, according to an Apple spokesman.
The Mac App Store sells software for Apple s personal computers and is separate from the much larger App Store that Apple operates for mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. Unlike iPhones and iPads, where users can only install third-party software via the App Store, Mac computers can bypass the Mac App Store and download third-party software directly from the internet, although the process takes more steps. Blix s software was not removed from the App Store for iPhones and iPads.
Separately, Apple is one of four tech giants that are under investigation for alleged anti-competitive behavior. The others are Alphabet s Google , Amazon.com  and Facebook , and the probes are being carried out by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and House Judiciary Committee.
The U.S. Justice Department has reached out to app developers as part of its investigation, according one of the developers and another person familiar with the investigation."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Tesla  driver killed in a March 2018 crash in California while using the Autopilot driver-assistance system had reported that on prior trips, the car had steered away from the highway, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) disclosed in documents made public Tuesday.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple  software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in Mountain View in autopilot mode at about 70 mph when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had reported issues on prior trips with Autopilot steering the wheel toward an area between a highway ramp and the lane. It is a moving violation to cross into that section of the road, known as the ""gore area.""
Data from the vehicle showed that in prior trips Huang had taken corrective action after Autopilot had steered toward the area. The NTSB said in the fatal crash Huang s hands were not detected on the steering wheel in the final six seconds before the crash. There was no evidence of braking or evasive action.
The NTSB, which also found evidence that the driver was using a smartphone during the trip, plans a Feb. 25 hearing to determine the probable cause of the crash. Tesla did not immediately comment.
Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, but the company advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.
During the final 18-minute Autopilot segment of the trip, the system did not detect his hands on the wheel about one-third of the time and the system issued two visual alerts for hands-off driving operation and one auditory alert.
The NTSB said Huang had been using an Apple-owned iPhone during his trip and records show evidence of data transmissions.
Logs recovered with Apple s assistance show a word building game application ""Three Kingdoms"" was active during Huang s fatal trip.
The NTSB said ""most players have both hands on the phone to support the device and manipulate game actions"" but added the log data ""does not provide enough information to ascertain whether the Tesla driver was holding the phone or how interactive he was with the game at the time of the crash.""
The NTSB, which previously criticized Tesla’s driver assistance system Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, said in September the system’s design permitted a ""driver to disengage from the driving task” in an earlier California crash."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq eked out record closes despite giving up some gains on Tuesday as a regulatory probe into previous deals by large-cap tech companies soured investor sentiment on stocks.

The S&P 500 rose 0.17%, Nasdaq Composite added 0.11% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.

The Federal Trade Commission issued special orders to five tech giants - including Alphabet s Google , Facebook , Microsoft , Amazon.com  and Apple  – requesting information on historical mergers to gauge reporting practices to antitrust authorities.
The request was for research purposes, but FTC Chairman Joseph Simons reportedly said ""hundreds"" of deals under scrutiny could lead to some ""unwinding"" of mergers.

The move raised fears over a more aggressive regulatory crackdown on big tech at a time when U.S. authorities are already investigating Google, Facebook, Amazon and others over potential anti-competitive behavior. 

Also adding pressure on tech, Facebook fell 2.8% after Pivotal Research downgraded the stock to sell from hold and lowered its target price to $180 from $215.
In telecoms, T-Mobile  and Sprint  surged after winning approval to go ahead with their merger. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero concluded the deal was unlikely to lessen competition.

As sentiment on tech stocks turned sour, the broader market gave up some gains, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell s testimony early Tuesday.
Powell expressed confidence in central bank s current monetary policy measures and reiterated that the economy remained in a good place in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

""We’ll be watching this (coronavirus impact) carefully,"" Powell told lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee. "" What will be the effects on the U.S. economy?   Will they be persistent?   Will they be material?  That’s really the question.""
But with the death roll in China rising above 1,000 and those infected topping 40,000, corporate earnings are reflecting the threat of the virus to the bottom line.
  Under Armour    slumped 19% after reporting mixed earnings and warning that sales would come under pressure from the coronavirus.

Hasbro , meanwhile, fell nearly 1% after the toymaker reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.
Boeing  gave up gains early-day gains to end flat, after the aircraft maker said that it booked no new jetliner orders in January, as it continues efforts to restore its reputation following the 737 MAX crisis."

Cloud security business has been the company s growth driver in recent quarters, as its content delivery business has come under pressure with companies including Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc  setting up their own networks.
In a push to improve its cloud security business, the company recently acquired security startup KryptCo and Israeli cyber security firm ChameleonX.
Total revenue rose 8.2% to $772.1 million, beating analysts  average estimate of $749.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue from the cloud security business, which helps data centers operate and deliver content securely, rose 28.8% to $237.9 million in the quarter.
Revenue from the company s media and carrier division rose 7.8%, as more people used their smartphones and computers to download games, videos and software from the internet.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Concerned that big tech companies are unfairly engaging in potential anti-competitive behavior, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday it ordered Alphabet Inc s  Google unit, Amazon.com Inc , Apple Inc ,  Facebook Inc   and  Microsoft Corp   to provide information on mergers that were too small to report to antitrust regulators.
The queries come as the Justice Department, the FTC, state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee are investigating the big tech platforms, which are accused of unfairly using their clout to defend market share or expand into adjacent markets.
Much of the criticism has focused on massive deals such as Facebook s acquisition of Instagram and Amazon s purchase of Whole Foods, but the companies also have spent billions on smaller companies, dramatically changing the competitive landscape in emerging tech sectors. 
FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said notices being issued to Big Tech companies were intended for research but could lead to enforcement action.
""If during the study we see that there are transactions that are problematic ... we could go back and initiate enforcement action to deal with those transactions,"" said Simons.
The notices were not meant to be a warning to the companies but were designed to identify areas that need more antitrust enforcement, he added. 
The FTC will study ""hundreds"" of acquisitions made by the companies and aims to finish its study ""quickly,"" agency officials said.
""It depends what they do with it,"" said Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project and a vocal critic of big tech companies. ""I m not going to say this is good until they do something that impacts power.""
Google, Amazon.com, Apple and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""We look forward to working with the FTC to answer their questions,"" a Microsoft spokesman said.
The agency asked for information about deals that were done between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2019, and require each company to identify transactions that were too small to report to the FTC and Justice Department, which assess mergers for compliance with antitrust law.
The tech giants have come under fire from both sides of the political spectrum, with Republicans irked by what they say is a stifling of conservative voices on social media and Democrats angered by increasing consolidation.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, has explicitly urged federal regulators to undo ""anti-competitive mergers,"" including Amazon s purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google s acquisitions of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.
Paul Holland, a general partner at Foundation Capital, said big tech players  frequent purchases of start-ups have been a double-edged sword.
""They ve created a true marketplace for startups. They ve created a destination for them,"" he said. But Holland added that the limited number of potential acquirers has also created an ""oligopolistic competitive environment"" for those sales.
Facebook acquired dozens of companies between 2010 and 2019, according to S&P Global  Market Intelligence data, including eye-catching purchases like WhatsApp and Instagram as well as smaller transactions in ad tech, facial recognition and social analytics.
Alphabet spent $1 billion on an unspecified number of small acquisitions in 2019, according to securities filings. Many were companies working on artificial intelligence research and cloud computing services, areas in which Google is trying to innovate quickly and has sought to bolster hiring.
With the exception of its $3 billion purchase of headphone and streaming company Beats in 2014, Apple has mostly made small deals valued at less than $500 million over the past decade, snapping up small companies working on key technologies such as augmented reality displays, camera sensors and artificial intelligence software.
In fiscal 2019, Microsoft made 19 small acquisitions for $1.6 billion, mostly in cash.

Microsoft has sought to consolidate its position in the business software market, with major acquisitions such as the LinkedIn  social network for business professionals and the code repository site GitHub. Since buying LinkedIn, which also fielded offers from Salesforce Inc , Microsoft has begun integrating its social network data with Microsoft products such as Outlook email."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan s Foxconn hopes to resume half of its production in China by month-end, a source told Reuters on Wednesday, as the supplier to tech giant Apple  and others reopens plants shut over a coronavirus outbreak. 
The world s largest contract electronics maker also aims to resume 80% of production in China in March, added the source, who has direct knowledge of the matter, citing internal targets set by Chairman Liu Young-Way.
Foxconn s reopenings after the Lunar New Year holiday were delayed by the rapid spread of the virus in China, which has killed more than 1,100 people, as the World Health Organization warned against a global threat potentially worse than terrorism.
""Chairman Liu hopes by end of February the production could reach 50%,"" said the person, who declined to be identified in the absence of authorization to speak publicly. 
""Shipments will be affected, but it s too early to give an exact number. We might still have a chance to make it with overtime, but we also need to monitor consumer sentiment to come for the end products,"" the source added.
The reference was to electronics, including smartphones.
Foxconn did not immediately respond to email and telephone calls to seek comment. 
Foxconn got the green light this week to reopen major plants in China, and its plant in the eastern city of Kunshan was also approved on Tuesday to resume production, an internal document reviewed by Reuters showed. 
But just about a tenth of the workforce had returned to two key plants in southern Shenzhen and central Zhengzhou as of Monday, a source told Reuters.
The two plants make up the bulk of Foxconn s assembly lines for Apple s iPhones and further delays to production after the enforced closures could hit global shipments.
Apple estimated first-quarter revenue in a wider range than usual to factor in the virus uncertainty.
On Monday, Foxconn reported a drop of 12% in revenue in January from a year ago, to T$364.6 billion ($12 billion). It did not give details.
Shares of Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, gained 3.1% on Wednesday, outperforming a rise of 0.9% in the benchmark index. 

The shares have lost more than 7% since the market reopened after the holiday break. "

By Geoffrey Smith 

Investing.com -- Wall Street raced to new all-time highs at the opening on Wednesday, driven by growing hopes that the coronavirus, now known as Covid-19, could soon peak.

However, China changed its methodology for counting new cases last week, and no longer includes those patients who test positive without showing symptoms. Given that the virus’ incubation period can last up to 24 days – also according to official Chinese data – that creates a clear risk of under-reporting. The economic impacts of the virus continue to become more visible, with big downward revisions to global oil demand and the increasing use of force majeure clauses by Chinese companies to get out of contractual obligations to buy inputs or deliver finished products.

By 10:05 AM ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 199 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 had risen 0.4%. Both touched new record highs in the opening minutes of trading after China’s authorities published figures showing a sharp fall in new cases of Covid-19 for the second day in a row. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%.
Buying was again concentrated in mega-cap stock such as Apple  and Amazon , despite a lack of newsflow out of either company.

Among those companies that did generate news on Wednesday, Shopify  rose 13.8% to a new all-time high after blowout numbers for its fourth quarter, and   Molson Coors    rose 5.1%, also helped by solid results (although nowhere near as solid as Heineken s : the Dutch brewer’s ADRs rose 5.9% after its quarterly report.

Elsewhere, the shorts betting against Bed Bath & Beyond s  turnaround were vindicated after the company’s same-store sales fell short of expectations in December and January. CEO Mark Tritton blamed product availability and weaker-than-expected store visits. BB&B stock fell 25%, reversing all the gains since October.

CVS Health  stock ground out another 1.2% increase after reporting above-forecast earnings for the fourth quarter, which were again supported by the contribution of Aetna, the insurer that it bought late in 2018.

Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks were lifted by a 2.9% rebound in U.S. crude futures, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its estimate for world oil demand this year by ‘only’ 230,000 barrels a day. The U.S. government had on Tuesday estimated demand destruction of 300,000 bpd.   Exxon Mobil    rose 1.4%, while   Chevron    rose 0.9% and   Devon Energy    rose 4.3%."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators plan to open an enquiry into the tech industry, according to a European Commission document seen by Reuters, a sign of more regulatory troubles ahead for Google , Facebook , Amazon  and other online groups.
The document also said competition enforcers were considering regulating the behavior of dominant companies as a preventive measure, a move that would address concerns that regulatory actions sometimes come too late to repair the harm suffered by smaller rivals.
The proposed enquiry comes on top of other legislation planned this year aimed at reining in the powers of dominant companies and helping European companies to compete more effectively with them as well as with Chinese rivals.
The document said the enquiry would focus on ""new and emerging markets that are shaping our economy and society"".
The Commission s competition arm has over the last two decades opened enquiries into sectors ranging from e-commerce to pharmaceuticals, financial services and energy, which subsequently resulted in investigations into individual companies and hefty fines.
The document said a tougher line was needed to deal with certain platforms that act as large private gatekeepers and rule-setters to markets and information because competition rules alone were not sufficient.
""Additional ex ante regulatory responses may be needed to ensure contestability and protect the interests of smaller players,"" the document said.

Foxconn made the comment in a statement to the Taipei stock exchange, without elaborating on its production status.

It was among many businesses that shuttered their mainland China plants due to the coronavirus outbreak and subsequently delayed resuming output.

""In the past, the aforementioned media s reports related to the group s mainland China plants resumption are mostly not factual,"" it said, adding that the reports have caused ""misunderstandings and difficulties for employees, investors and the general public.""
When asked to clarify which aspects of the reports Foxconn was referring to, company spokesman Jimmy Huang told Reuters by telephone on Thursday that all elaborations were made in the statement to the stock exchange.
Reuters reported on Monday that Foxconn got the green light to reopen two major plants in China closed due to the coronavirus, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Foxconn aims to resume production even though only about 10% of the workforce had returned as of Monday, the person said.

The San Jose, California-based company is a major supplier to high-end smart phone makers such as Apple Inc , with whom it has signed deals to supply as much as $15 billion worth of chips.
The Broadcom chip released on Thursday handles Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless communication functions in devices such as smart phones. The Bluetooth portion of the chip uses two radios in tandem to communicate with devices such as headphones.
Vijay Nagarajan, vice president of Broadcom s mobile connectivity division, said the technology is meant to prevent choppy calls and music listening when walking into crowded areas like subway platforms, where Bluetooth signals from other people s devices can cause interference and dropouts.
""We’re making your wireless link from your phone to the headset more resilient,"" Nagarajan told Reuters.
The Bluetooth chips also keep one of their radios in a low-power mode so that it can stay on all the time to ""listen"" for devices trying to connect to a mobile phone, a feature meant to help wireless headphones connect faster.
The chip will also support Wi-Fi 6E, a new version of the common wireless standard that is expected to be much faster than previous versions if both a phone and a Wi-Fi router have new chips that support it.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government s antitrust victory over chip supplier  Qualcomm Inc   drew tough questions for the Federal Trade Commision from a panel of three appellate judges in San Francisco on Thursday.
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in a closely watched case the regulator brought against Qualcomm in early 2017.
San Diego, California-based Qualcomm supplies modem chips that connect phones and other devices to wireless data networks, but patent licensing drives most of its profits. 
The company is fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh. That judge sided with antitrust regulators, writing that Qualcomm’s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips “strangled competition"" and harmed consumers.
The panel of judges probed the FTC on how Qualcomm may have violated antitrust laws, even if the company did use its dominant position in the chip market to gain higher patent royalties.
""Anticompetitive behavior is prohibited under the Sherman Act. Hyper-competitive behavior is not. This case asks us to draw the line between the two,"" Judge Stephen Joseph Murphy III said.
The FTC argued Qualcomm applied an excessive ""surcharge"" to phone makers, charging them too high a price for patent licenses because the phone makers had to sign the deals to get Qualcomm s chips. 
""Doesn t the Supreme Court say that patent holders have the right to price their patents? What would be anticompetitive about that?"" Judge Johnnie Rawlinson asked.
Brian Fletcher, a law professor from Stanford University brought in by the FTC, responded that phone makers could not challenge the patent prices in negotiations or other court proceedings for fear of losing access to Qualcomm s chips.
Judge Consuelo María Callahan asked whether the FTC s case had conflated profits with anticompetitive behavior. She asked Qualcomm s attorney if Qualcomm s practices ""helped Qualcomm make lots of money for a few years, is that in and of itself an antitrust violation, even if consumers paid higher prices for cell phones?”
Representing Qualcomm, Tom Goldstein responded no. He conceded Qualcomm was a monopoly, but argued that it broke no laws because its chips were better than rivals.
""It is the prospect that a monopolist will make a lot of money that encourages it to do so much innovation. That is what capitalism is intended to encourage,"" he said.

A decision in the appeal could take anywhere from several months to more than a year."

(Reuters) - Roku Inc beat Wall Street estimates for holiday-quarter sales and forecast full-year revenue above expectations on Thursday, as the video streaming device maker benefited from the launch of new streaming services from Walt  Disney   and Apple.
Shares of the company rose 6% after the bell.
Roku expects full-year revenue between $1.58 billion and $1.62 billion, while analysts were expecting $1.58 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Streaming device makers have benefited alongside platforms like Netflix Inc  and Amazon.com  Inc s Prime Video as consumers cut the cord to cable or satellite TV and shift to subscription-based streaming services.
New services and increased content on the platform is a positive thing for Roku, Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden told Reuters.
""It attracts more users to the platform, it drives more engagement, and that gives us the foundation to help monetize, in one way or the other,"" Louden said.
Roku has shifted its focus from device sales to advertising, which is now the company s fastest-growing revenue stream, to tap the jump in number of streaming services providers.
Advertising is one of the biggest opportunities for Roku as the viewership moves from traditional TV to streaming, Louden added.
The company charges a commission from media companies that stream programming on the free, ad-supported Roku channel.
Roku added 4.6 million active accounts in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 36.9 million at the end of the year.
""We see the customer adds as an example of Roku s ability to exploit increasing interest in OTT for new SVOD s, such as Apple+ and Disney+"", D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said. 
Roku s streaming devices compete with the likes of Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Google  Chromecast. Amazon said last month it had surpassed 40 million active users globally for its streaming device. 
Total net revenue jumped about 49% to $411.2 million, beating analysts  average estimates of $391.6 million.
The company posted net loss attributable to common stockholders of $15.7 million, or 13 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $6.8 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. 

The loss of 13 cents per share matched Wall Street expectations. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Ray Dalio s Bridgewater Associates, Viking Global Investors, and Granite Point Capital were among prominent hedge funds placing new bets on electric carmaker Tesla Inc  in the fourth quarter, positioning them to gain from its nearly 100% rally over the first six weeks of the year.
The positions were revealed in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released on Thursday and Friday, which are one of the few public ways of tracking what hedge fund managers are selling and buying. The disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
If each hedge fund had held on to its stake, Bridgewater s purchase of nearly 45,000 shares would be worth approximately $36 million, while Viking s purchase of nearly 52,000 shares would be would be worth slightly more than $42 million. Granite Pointe purchased 3,000 shares in the fourth quarter, which would now be worth approximately $2.5 million.
Mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price, meanwhile, revealed that it had doubled its stake in the company in the fourth quarter, to 1.7 million shares.
The moves into Tesla came as the high tech automaker remained among the most divisive stocks on Wall Street. Bullish investors see founder Elon Musk as reinventing the energy business while bears see an unprofitable company that is significantly over-valued. Tesla s shares were off slightly in afternoon trading in New York on Friday at around $801.00."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Friday said it has taken a $549.1 million stake in Kroger  Co, investing in the largest U.S. supermarket chain as smaller rivals struggle.
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed investments as of Dec. 31, Berkshire also said it took a new 648,000 share stake in drugmaker Biogen Inc  worth $192.4 million, and significantly reduced its stakes in two major banks,  Wells Fargo   & Co and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc .
Berkshire has sold more than 86 million shares, or 21%, of its Wells Fargo stake since June 30, as the bank tries to restore its reputation following scandals over its mistreatment of customers.
Since the scandals began erupting in September 2016, the Standard & Poor s 500 has risen 55%, while Wells Fargo is down 3%. Berkshire began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989.
Kroger shares rose 3.9% and Biogen rose 1.5% in after-hours trading, a sign of investors  regard for Buffett and the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he has run since 1965.
Investors monitor Berkshire s quarterly filings to see where Buffett and his portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who is also chief executive of Berkshire s Geico car insurer, see value.
Friday s filing does not say who bought or sold particular stocks, though Buffett normally directs big investments such as Wells Fargo and Apple Inc , Berkshire s largest.
Buffett s assistant, along with Kroger and Biogen, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Kroger, in which Berkshire disclosed an 18.94 million share stake, has invested heavily to expand online, upgrade stores and improve deliveries to compete with Walmart  Inc and Amazon.com Inc , the latter also a Berkshire holding.
Many smaller chains have fared worse, and Earth Fare, Fairway and Lucky s have sought bankruptcy protection this year. Kroger had invested in Lucky s.
Berkshire s Wells Fargo stake fell 15% in the quarter to 323.2 million shares worth $17.4 billion, trailing its stakes in Bank of America Corp  and  American Express  Co .
The Goldman stake shrank 35% to 12 million shares worth $2.8 billion. That stake had its origins in Buffett s lucrative foray into Goldman preferred stock during the 2008 financial crisis.
Berkshire also has more than 90 operating units including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and namesake energy, real estate brokerage and auto dealer businesses.
Friday s filing suggests Berkshire s stock buying did not significantly dent its $128.2 billion cash hoard from Sept. 30.

Berkshire should discuss its holdings more on Feb. 22, when it releases its annual report and Buffett s annual letter to shareholders."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The head of publisher  Bertelsmann  (F:BTGGg) said its TV arm RTL  should be allowed to merge with German rival ProSiebenSat.1 (DE:PSMGn), to give them a fighting chance against U.S. streaming giants.
Thomas Rabe s comments - in an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung published on Sunday - come as European broadcasters explore ways to join forces against the onslaught from established players Netflix  and Amazon  Prime that are now being joined by Disney and Apple .
""It is vital that sensible partnerships, and even large mergers, are allowed in order to create national champions in television - for example between RTL and ProSiebenSat.1,"" Rabe said.
""Otherwise, national companies will simply have no chance in a few years against the giants from Silicon Valley,"" added the Bertelsmann boss, who took personal charge over its largest unit RTL last year.
ProSieben has become the focus of takeover speculation after Italy s  Mediaset   amassed a 15.1% stake in the Munich-based broadcaster towards the end of last year.
Mediaset, run by the son of former premier Silvio Berlusconi, has described its ProSieben stake as defensive. At the same time it is trying to persuade ProSieben CEO Max Conze to join a pan-European broadcasting alliance it is setting up.
Conze has so far resisted Mediaset s overtures, preferring to search for ways to cooperate on individual projects.
Reacting to Rabe s comments, ProSieben said: ""No talks are taking place at the moment on mergers or acquisitions.""
In a statement, ProSieben highlighted work on its adtech joint venture with RTL, called d-force, and repeated its earlier invitation to RTL to sign up to Joyn, its streaming venture with U.S. partner Discovery Inc .
Rabe, in his FAS interview, said it was vital to deregulate the European TV industry because the rules governing it predate the creation of platforms such as YouTube, Facebook  and Netflix.
""Competition law does not take into account the forms in which the U.S. platforms are increasingly coming to dominate the media and advertising,"" he said.
Although he was wearing two hats as the boss of both Bertelsmann and RTL, Rabe said that did not signify the parent company would increase its 75% stake in the TV unit, nor would it seek a delisting.

""RTL Group is and will remain an independent business,"" he said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro fell toward a three-year low versus the dollar ahead of a highly watched German survey on Tuesday, which is expected to show a sharp slump in investor confidence and fuel growing pessimism about the outlook for Europe s largest economy.
Financial markets clung to tight ranges following a U.S. public holiday on Monday, shifting the investor focus to European news and developments in the coronavirus crisis.
Among Asian currencies, the Australian dollar slipped below the 67 U.S. cent level after minutes from the central bank s last meeting revived the prospect of policy easing while the Chinese yuan was weighed by worries about the economic impact of the coronavirus.
Sentiment for the euro has worsened dramatically this month after weak manufacturing and gross domestic product data from Germany, Europe s largest economy, suggested that the euro zone is more vulnerable to external shocks that previously thought.
""The euro is close to testing an important support level at $1.08 due to the diverging economic outlook between the euro zone and the United States,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""It looks a little oversold, so in the very short-term there could be a bounce, but the euro s fundamentals still point more to the downside.""
The euro (EUR=EBS) fell 0.12% to $1.0827 in Asia, close to its lowest since April 2017.
Since the start of February, the single currency has lost 2.4% versus the greenback as disappointing economic data raised concerns that euro zone monetary policy will have to remain accommodative for much longer.
The euro s next hurdle is the release of Germany s ZEW survey later on Tuesday, which is forecast to show economic sentiment slipped from the highest since July 2015.
Sterling also nursed losses against the dollar and the euro due to worries about economic ties between Britain and the European Union as both sides laid out conflicting views on how to proceed with trade negotiations.
The pound  held steady at $1.2998 in Asia on Tuesday following a 0.3% decline in the previous session. Sterling (EURGBP=D3) was quoted at 83.33 pence per euro, nursing a 0.4% decline on Monday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson s Europe adviser David Frost said on Monday Britain would not be threatened into following EU rules to win a free trade agreement with the bloc.
Frost s comments contrast with those of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has called on Britain to guarantee fair competition based on ambitious environmental and labor standards.
Britain left the EU last month and the two sides will now start negotiating a new relationship from trade to security.
The onshore yuan  was a tad lower at 6.9859 versus the dollar, unsettled by a decline in Chinese shares after Apple Inc  said it will not meet sales targets because the virus epidemic has slowed production and demand in China.
China s Hubei province, considered the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, said new cases of the illness fell slightly to 1,807 on Monday from 1,933 the previous day.
Currency traders are cautiously monitoring new data on the virus given uncertainty about the actual number of cases and difficulties in estimating when the epidemic will peak.
The yen , which initially gained on safe-haven flows as the outbreak unfolded last month, held steady in a narrow range at 109.74 per dollar.
The Australian dollar  fell 0.39% to $0.6690 after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia s first meeting of the year showed policymakers discussed easing policy.
The RBA kept rates unchanged at an all-time low of 0.75% at that meeting, but the minutes showed central bankers are prepared to ease policy further if needed.
The New Zealand dollar  also fell 0.4% to $0.6411."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) has launched smartphone delivery services for customers to test its new products, as the spread of the coronavirus has prompted the tech giant to cancel promotional events and brace for weak store sales.
The move highlights efforts made by the global smartphone industry, one of the tech sectors most hurt by the virus outbreak in China, to minimize the impact on business.
Analysts say the virus may slash demand for smartphones by half in the first quarter in China, the world s biggest market for the devices.
Apple Inc  warned on Monday it was unlikely to meet a sales target set just three weeks ago, while Xiaomi Corp had to livestream its smartphone launch event last week because of nationwide restrictions on travel and large gatherings.
Samsung, which unveiled a new foldable smartphone and a trio of its flagship Galaxy S20 models last week, is also curtailing brick-and-mortar marketing.
The South Korean smartphone maker has decided to sharply cut the number of in-store ""experimental zones,"" where consumers can try out the latest phones, and skip promotional events such as ""Galaxy fan parties"" for the latest device over worries about the spread of the virus, dubbed SARS-Cov-2.
There will only be nine such zones for the Galaxy S20, compared with the 130 it had for Galaxy Note 10 series in South Korea, according to Samsung s website.
Samsung customers who want to try out the Galaxy S20 can have one delivered to their door and can use it for up to 24 hours. A delivery worker will pick it up after that, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
""We are introducing a new service, as coronavirus-related issues could result in less in-store experience,"" one of the people said, adding that the service is expected to be available only in some parts of South Korea.

Investing.com - Asian markets fell on Tuesday morning, with Hong Kong and Japan’s apple suppliers’ stocks underperforming after the tech giant issued a revenue warning.
The Hang Seng Index was down 1.3% by 10:45 PM ET (02:45 GMT), while the Nikkei 225 fell 1.6%.
South Korea’s KOSPI also lost 1.3%.

In China, the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 0.4% and 0.2% lower respectively.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 slid 0.3%.
Overnight, Apple  said it is not likely to meet its quarterly revenue forecast because of lower iPhone supply globally and declining Chinese demand.

Apple  suppliers in Asia fell sharply in morning trade following the news. Japan’s   Taiyo Yuden Co., Ltd.   (T:6976) plunged more than 5%, while Alps Alpine and Murata Manufacturing slumped more than 3%.

Hong Kong’s Sunny Optical Technology Group Co Ltd (HK:2382) dived 3.4%, and AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK:2018) stumbled 2.9%. South Korea’s   SK Hynix Inc   (KS:000660) lost 1.0%, and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) declined 1.5%.
“This unexpected news confirms the worst fears of the Street that the virus outbreak has dramatically impacted iPhone supply from China/Foxconn with a demand ripple impact worldwide,” Wedbush Securities analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe wrote in a note cited by CNBC, adding that the magnitude of the impact is “clearly worse than feared.”
“While this news is a tough pill to swallow for the bulls, Apple  remains a company significantly exposed to this virus issue given the company’s massive supply and demand tentacles throughout China,” they added.
Meanwhile, HSBC Bank, Europe’s largest lender, is due to report its full year result later in the day."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  warned on Monday it was unlikely to meet its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago as the world s most valuable technology firm became one of the biggest corporate casualties of China s coronavirus epidemic.
The rapidly spreading virus has killed nearly 1,900 in China and stricken some 72,000 people, confining millions to their homes, disrupting supply chains and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.
Manufacturing facilities in China that produce Apple s iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said. That will mean fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.
Some of its retail stores in the country remain closed or are operating at reduced hours, which will hurt sales this quarter. China accounted for 15% of Apple s revenue, or $13.6 billion, last quarter, and supplied 18% of revenue in the year-ago quarter.
In late January, Apple had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, which it said was a wider than normal range due to the uncertainty created by the virus. It did not offer a new revenue estimate nor provide a profit forecast on Monday.
""The magnitude of this impact to miss its revenue guidance midway through February is clearly worse than feared,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.
Apple, worth $1.4 trillion by market capitalization, could face a torrid market reaction on Tuesday, when Wall Street reopens after the Presidents Day holiday, analysts said.
""If Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley   Securities.
Shares of its Asian suppliers fell on the news, with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) losing 2.4%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) down 1.8% and SK Hynix (KS:000660) shedding 3.3%.
Analysts have estimated that the virus may slash demand for smartphones by half in the first quarter in China, the world s biggest market for the devices.
SHORT-TERM IMPACT?
Apple said it will reopen China stores ""as steadily and safely as we can,"" while global supplies of iPhones will be limited as manufacturers work toward operating plants at full capacity. It plans to provide more information in April, when it releases first-quarter results.
Wedbush said it remained optimistic that Apple would be able to recover from the coronavirus setback.
""While trying to gauge the impact of the iPhone miss and potential bounce back in the June quarter will be front and center for the Street, we remain bullish on Apple for the longer term,"" Ives said.
The disruption follows a strong December quarter for iPhone sales, which were up for the first time in a year. That could provide an opening for mobile phone rival Samsung, which has invested in manufacturing capacity in Vietnam and elsewhere.
Samsung launched smartphone delivery services for customers to test its new products this week, as the spread of the virus has prompted the South Korean firm to cancel promotional events and brace for weak store sales.
Apple s contract manufacturers have added far more locations inside China than outside, with major supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) expanding from 19 locations in 2015 to 29 in 2019 and another supplier,  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938), going from eight to 12 locations, according to data from Apple.
In contrast, Samsung had signaled early in the U.S.-China trade war that it could meet U.S mobile phone demand without China production. Samsung is also far less exposed to China as an end market."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, tracking losses in financial markets on lingering concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China and its effect on oil demand.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was at $57.07 a barrel, down 60 cents, or 1%, by 0348 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) fell 38 cents, or 0.7%, to $51.67 a barrel.
""Oil prices remain heavy as energy traders may have been overly optimistic as to the crude demand impact of the coronavirus, and in fading optimism that OPEC + will come through with deeper production cuts in March,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""Optimism that China would see a return to normalcy in travel and trade next quarter was probably wrong... The rest of world is exercising caution on virus spreading fears and that will do no favors for crude s demand outlook."" 
U.S. stock futures slipped from record levels on Tuesday after Apple Inc , the most valuable company in the United States, said it will not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter as the coronavirus outbreak slowed production and weakened demand in China.
The number of new coronavirus infections in mainland China fell below 2,000 on Tuesday for the first time since January, Chinese health officials said, although global experts warn it is too early to say the outbreak is being contained. 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week the virus was set to cause oil demand to fall by 435,000 barrels per day (bpd) year-on-year in the first quarter, in what would be the first quarterly drop since the financial crisis in 2009. 
Still, with some Chinese independent refineries snapping up crude supplies after being absent from the market for weeks, traders held out hopes that China s demand could recover in coming months. 
Investors are also anticipating that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, will approve a proposal to deepen production cuts to tighten global supplies and support prices.
The group, known as OPEC+, has an agreement to cut oil output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March.
Oil output from Libya has fallen sharply since Jan. 18 because of a blockade of ports and oil fields by groups loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar.

Libya s national oil corporation, NOC, said on Monday that oil production was at 135,745 barrels per day as of Monday, compared with 1.2 million bpd before the stoppage."

Gold Futures inched up 0.2% to $1,589.25 by 12:45 AM ET (04:45 GMT). 
Sino-U.S. trade news were back in focus following today’s reports that China will grant tariff exemptions on 696 additional U.S. goods, including key agricultural and energy products such as pork, beef, soybeans, liquefied natural gas and crude oil.
The news came one month after Beijing and Washington signed the phase 1 trade deal. Under the agreement, China will boost its purchases of goods and services from the U.S. by $200 billion over two years.
Separately, Bloomberg cited four people familiar with the matter and said the Trump administration is considering new restrictions on exports of cutting-edge technology to China.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) stands to be a major beneficiary of the China production problems announced by rival Apple Inc  on Monday, reaping the rewards of a decade-long bet on low-cost smartphone manufacturing in Vietnam.
Half of Samsung s smartphones are now made in Vietnam, where the coronavirus that has crippled the China operations of Apple and many other firms has so far had only a limited impact on its production.
Apple said on Monday it would not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus impact on both production and sales in China, where most iPhones are made. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp last week also flagged a hit to its March quarter sales.
Huawei, another major Samsung rival, has not announced any production problems, but Samsung insiders, analysts and suppliers expect it will also be hit hard due to its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing and parts. Many Chinese and foreign firms have begun to re-open China factories that were idled for weeks, but shortages of workers and other problems have in many cases kept output to a minimum.
Samsung has also largely ceded the China market to its rivals in recent years, meaning it won t suffer from the store closures and drop in demand that is hitting Apple and others.
""Samsung is better positioned to weather the virus fallout than its formidable rivals such as Huawei and Apple,"" a person with knowledge of Samsung s supply chain told Reuters.
""The virus exposed China risks. We feel fortunate that we were able to escape the risks,"" he said.
Another person familiar with Samsung s thinking told Reuters: ""Samsung does not say it publicly. But it is relieved.""
Still, two sources familiar with Samsung s Vietnam operations cautioned that should the virus outbreak be prolonged, Samsung would feel the impact, as the company sources many components from China.
Problems with cross-border shipments also cropped up in the early phases of the virus outbreak as Vietnam imposed stricter border controls, according to Hong Sun, vice chairman of Korea Chamber of Business in Vietnam. The issues have since been resolved, Sun said, but risks remain if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work.
Samsung also relies on Chinese contract manufacturers for some low-end models.
In a statement to Reuters, the company said: ""We are making our best effort to minimize any impact on our operations.""
TrendForce recently cut its first quarter production forecasts for Huawei by 15% and Apple by 10%. It cut projections for Samsung Electronics by a smaller 3%.
Before the virus, the global smartphone market had been expected to end two consecutive years of falls, driven by smartphones running on faster 5G wireless networks. But the virus outbreak will throw cold water on any rebound, with global shipments likely to record another decline.
Since starting phone production in Vietnam in 2009, Samsung has aggressively boosted output through cheaper labor and generous government incentives. A number of South Korean suppliers followed suit, powering its breakneck growth.
Samsung ended its own smartphone production in China last year as its market share plunged to nearly zero.
Apple makes most of its iPhones in China via Chinese company Foxconn. Manufacturing facilities there that produce Apple s iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said on Monday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As investors crunch numbers to determine how the coronavirus will hit China’s economy, hedge fund manager Nathaniel Polachek has tied much of his outlook to the fate of a ship anchored near Weihai, China.
The vessel carries some 750 tons of lead concentrate that Polachek, head of New York-based Commodity Asset Management, purchased in Greece to sell on the Chinese mainland.
The coronavirus outbreak has kept the ship idling off China’s coast for weeks, as movement restrictions and factory closures slow swathes of the world’s second-largest economy to a crawl.
Word that the ship has been allowed to dock in Weihai - an access point to one of China s main industrial hubs and home to several metal refineries and smelters - would be one signal that business activity is finally picking up, Polachek said.
Another encouraging sign would be an increase in air pollution levels over key Chinese manufacturing areas, which Polachek monitors daily using the Air Quality Index web site.
“The best indicators are ... from the physical world,” he said. “I want to see how long it takes for materials to get off the boat, how long it takes for me to get paid for them.”
Doubts over whether there are more cases in China than are being captured by official figures have fueled a do-it-yourself approach among investors looking to determine the outbreak’s trajectory and gauge its economic impact. The tools they use range from artificial intelligence and computer modeling to simple word of mouth.
Investors “don’t believe the stuff they’ve been hearing from the Chinese government,” said Leland Miller, head of China Beige Book International, which regularly surveys thousands of Chinese firms to gauge business conditions in the country.
Chinese officials have defended Beijing’s management of the epidemic and rejected the idea that China was not transparent enough in its initial handling of the outbreak.
The latest data provided by China indicated a decline in new cases but “every scenario is still on the table” in terms of the epidemic’s evolution, the World Health Organization said Monday.
The economic toll, meanwhile, has started to pile up, with Apple Inc  the latest company to warn of the impact.
Many of Miller’s clients--which include hedge funds and pension funds with as much as $100 billion under management--remain uneasy about the potentially disruptive effects of the virus on global growth, even as they continue betting on more upside in an equity rally that’s taken markets to record highs.
“Everyone realizes that they are not pricing in much risk,” he said.
His firm’s next survey will contain new questions about the effects of the lockdown, such as whether the respondent has returned to work or working from home.
Others are relying on their contacts inside the country. Kevin Smith, founder of Denver-based Crescat Capital and a longtime skeptic on China’s economy, increased his bets against the country’s stocks after receiving an email from one of the firm’s Chinese clients describing “paralyzing and tragic scenes” in Hubei, the outbreak’s epicenter.
“It’s not really possible for us to be any more bearish on China,” said Smith, who has been betting against China’s currency since 2014. “But we are more convinced that this is a catalyst for a downturn.”
Some methods verge on the macabre.
John Lekas, CEO and senior portfolio manager at Leader Capital in Portland, Oregon, has been seeking any sort of on-the-ground information, including crematorium activity in hard hit areas, to assess the death toll. So far, any information he’s received on the subject has been unverifiable.
Lekas’ more mundane methods include studying data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security to determine when the rate of new cases will equal the rate of recoveries, a point he believes would indicate a peak in the outbreak. Using his own calculations based on the daily figures, he predicts such a point will come in early March.
His $450 million fund has been buying Treasuries, a popular destination for nervous investors."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares fell and Wall Street was poised to retreat from record highs on Tuesday after Apple Inc  said it would miss its March quarter revenue guidance as the coronavirus slowed production and weakened demand in China.
The warning from the most valuable U.S. company sobered investor optimism that stimulus from China and other countries would protect the global economy from the effects of the epidemic.
S&P500 e-mini futures (ESc1) slipped as much as 0.4% in Asian trade while Nasdaq futures  fell 0.6%.
European stocks were expected to follow suit, with major European stock futures (STXEc1) (FDXc1) (FFIc1) trading 0.5-0.6% lower.
MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1.0%, while Tokyo s Nikkei (N225) slid 1.4%, dragged down by tech stocks.
China s CSI300 (CSI300) blue chip shares gave up 0.5%, following a strong rally that was fueled by hopes Beijing would introduce more policy stimulus.
China s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending on Monday, paving the way for a likely reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday.
However, sentiment took a subsequent knock as Apple said factories in China were re-opening but ramping up more slowly than expected, reinforcing signs of a broader hit to businesses from the epidemic.
""Apple is saying its recovery could be delayed, which could mean the impact of the virus may go beyond the current quarter,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley   Securities.
""If Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell.""
Asian tech shares were also hit. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) dropped 2.9%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) lost 2.9% and Sony Corp (T:6758) shed 2.5%.
In China, the number of new Covid-19 cases fell to 1,886 on Monday from 2,048 the day before. The World Health Organization cautioned, however, that ""every scenario is still on the table"" in terms of the epidemic s evolution.
As China s authorities try to prevent the spread of the disease, the economy is paying a heavy price. Some cities remained in lockdown, streets are deserted, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country, preventing migrant workers from getting back to their jobs.
Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond, as highlighted by Apple.
""Lifting travel restrictions is taking longer than expected. Initially we thought lockdowns would end in February and factory output would normalize in March. But that is looking increasingly difficult,"" said Ei Kaku, currency strategist at Nomura Securities.
Nomura downgraded its China first-quarter economic growth forecast to 3% from a year earlier, half the pace of the fourth quarter, from its previous forecast of 3.8%.
Nomura says there was a risk it could be even weaker.
Also hurting market sentiment was news that the Trump administration is considering changing U.S. regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to Huawei Technologies from companies such as Taiwan s TSMC, the world s largest contract chipmaker.
Bonds were in demand, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield falling 4.2 basis point to 1.546% (US10YT=RR) after a U.S. public holiday on Monday.
Safe-haven gold  also rose 0.3% to its two-week high of $1,587.00 per ounce.
In the currency market, the yen ticked up 0.15% to 109.69 yen per dollar  while the risk-sensitive Australian dollar lost 0.4% to $0.6686 . The yuan was steadier for now, trading at 6.9950 yuan per dollar .
The euro, grappling with worries about sluggish growth in the euro zone, edged down 0.1% to $1.0833 (EUR=), near its 33-month low of $1.0817 touched on Monday.
Oil prices slipped on fresh concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Brent crude (LCOc1) fell 0.6% to $57.30 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) slipped 0.3% to $51.90 a barrel."

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Tuesday, as a revenue warning from Apple  and weak earnings from HSBC laid bare the extent of the damage caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China.

At 02:00 ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 86 points, or 0.6% lower. France s CAC 40 futures were down 33 points, or 0.5%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 43 points, or 0.6%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 22 points, or 0.6%. 
Late Monday, Apple  said it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand due to the outbreak of Covid-19 in China.
The tech giant was expected to be hard hit given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China, but the sales warning is a graphic example of the impact on one of Wall Street’s favourite stocks which has been priced for success.
Apple shares  are up over 10% already this year, having climbed over 80% last year, and now make up around 12% of the Nasdaq 100 index.

Adding to Tuesday’s woes was a disappointing earnings report from HSBC , which announced a drop of 33% to its profit before tax for 2019, hit by one-time write-offs linked to its investment banking and commercial banking businesses in Europe.
HSBC, which makes most of its money in Asia, also warned that the ongoing coronavirus epidemic could in the long run reduce its revenue and cause bad loans to rise as supply chains are disrupted.
Europe’s largest bank by assets also unveiled plans to cut $100 billion in assets, slash its investment bank and restructure in the United States and Europe, as part of an overhaul in a bid to improve returns.

Capital Economics said in a report that it is now all but certain that China s economy will contract in quarter-on-quarter terms in the first quarter. ""We have penciled in a fall in output of 2.5%,"" wrote group chief economist Neil Shearing.
Elsewhere,   Accor   , Europe s largest hotel group, could be in focus after it said it was joining forces with American card giant Visa  to offer a payment card to members of its lifestyle loyalty program 

Looking at European economic data, the German ZEW is due at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), and will be the first post-coronavirus indicator of sentiment in the eurozone’s largest economy. Investing.com has predicted a drop in the key economic sentiment indicator to 21.5 from 26.7. 

Also due Tuesday, at 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), will be the latest unemployment data from the U.K., which will be of interest as a pointer to the thinking in the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee ahead of its next rate-setting meeting. 
Oil markets have sold off Tuesday, after a partial recovery last week, amid lingering demand concerns due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Eyes remain firmly fixed on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, and whether they will approve a proposal to deepen production cuts to tighten global supplies.
The group, also known as OPEC+, has an agreement to cut oil output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March."

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) has pumped $2.5 billion of its own cash into new investments since October, people familiar with the matter said, hoping to restore its money-making credentials as it courts investors for a successor to its Vision Fund.
The Japanese technology conglomerate is also considering investing another $2.5 billion of its own money, one of the people said.
SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said last week the company may spend up to two years investing its own money in a bridge fund, to build a portfolio that will give investors enough confidence to participate in a second Vision Fund. To that end, he said SoftBank has already invested ""billions"" of U.S. dollars, but he did not provide an exact figure.
SoftBank was targeting a $108 billion fundraise for the second Vision Fund, and had committed $38 billion of its own money toward that goal. However, Son said last week its launch had been delayed due to investor ""concerns"" about the performance of the first $100 billion Vision Fund.
The pace of SoftBank s latest investments contrasts markedly with that of the first Vision Fund, which spent over $80 billion after its first major fundraising close in May 2017.
The fund s investment spree drove a rally in the valuations of a number of technology start-ups, such as office space-sharing company WeWork and ride-hailing firm  Uber Technologies Inc  . This rally fizzled out once these companies  losses mounted along with their breakneck growth.
SoftBank was forced to save WeWork from bankruptcy last year in a roughly $10 billion financing deal, while Uber s shares are trading more than 10% below the price of their initial public offering in March 2019, even after a recent rally.
Last week, SoftBank said the first Vision Fund had realized $9.5 billion in cash and mark-to-market gains as of December-end. That represents a 9.5% gain since its first major fundraising close, versus 25% in the S&P 500 Index over the same period.
BRIDGE FUND
SoftBank has made seven investments since October - including U.S. drug retailer Alto Pharmacy and Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart - and has half a dozen more in the pipeline, Rajeev Misra, a SoftBank executive who also runs the Vision Fund, said at an investment conference in Abu Dhabi last week.
Abu Dhabi s Mubadala and Saudi Arabia s Public Investment Fund (PIF) account for the bulk of the first Vision Fund at $60 billion. They have yet to commit to the second fund.
Son spoke to Mubadala executives last week to convince them that the turnaround the Vision Fund was implementing in its investment portfolio was working, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the information was not public.
SoftBank and PIF declined to comment. A Mubadala spokesman said his company was a long-term partner of SoftBank, with which it was in regular discussion.
Bridge funds are commonly deployed by private equity and venture capital fund managers struggling with their investment track record, in order to attract investors reluctant to commit to blind pools of capital.
In 2014, loyal investors helped TPG Capital Management LP raise a $2 billion bridge fund after the buyout firm s previous $19 billion fund suffered losses in key investments. TPG rolled that bridge fund into a new $10.5 billion fund in 2016 after securing enough investor support.
In SoftBank s case, the bridge capital has come exclusively from the company itself. SoftBank has 3.8 trillion yen ($34.65 billion) in cash on hand but is currently being pressured by Elliott Management Corp to buy back shares, to boost the value of what the hedge fund considers underperforming stock.
SoftBank also has developed a hedge fund overseen by Misra, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.
In July, SoftBank said investors including  Microsoft Corp  , Apple Inc  ,  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (TW:2317) and Japanese banks were willing to commit $108 billion to the second Vision Fund.
Seven months later, the fund has not received any money from outside investors.

Meanwhile, the first Vision Fund has invested $80.5 billion in 88 companies, SoftBank disclosed last week. While it raised over $100 billion, the fund needs to retain the remainder for potential re-investment in portfolio companies, as well as for coupon payments on outstanding debt, Son said."

Investing.com - European stock markets fell Tuesday amid weak earnings from banking heavyweight HSBC and a revenue warning from Apple  that weighed on the tech sector.

At 04:10 ET (0910 GMT), the U.K. s FTSE index was trading 40 points, or 0.5%, lower, France s CAC 40 was down 0.7%, while the DAX was down 0.9%. The pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 0.7%. 

Earlier Tuesday, HSBC , Europe’s largest bank by assets, said it would cut 15% of its workforce to restore profitability after reporting a drop in profit before tax of 33% for 2019. It will cut $100 billion in assets, slash its investment bank and restructure in the United States and Europe.
Elsewhere in the banking sector, Italy s largest lender   Intesa Sanpaolo    announced an unsolicited bid for smaller rival Unione di Banche Italiane SpA  in an all-stock deal valued at just under 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion). UBI stock rose 24%, while Intesa s rose 1.2%. The deal would help consolidate a fragmented Italian banking sector, and hopes of further mergers lifted other Italian bank stocks such as Banco Bpm SpA .

Late Monday, Apple  said it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand caused by the outbreak of Covid-19 in China. Its shares dropped over 5% in Frankfurt trading.

The iPhone maker was expected to be hard hit, given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China, but the warning is a graphic example of the impact on a Wall Street favorite that has been priced for success.

Other stocks in the tech sector have been hit hard as a consequence: STMicroelectronics  dropped 3.5%, Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) fell 2.7% and ASML Holding  down 1.9%. Apple  supplier   Ams AG    fell 3.1%.

In other earnings news,   Glencore    reported annual results which beat market expectations but the shares still dropped 1%.

Shares in rival miner BHP Billiton  dropped almost 2% despite increasing its interim dividend after its profit and revenue rose on higher commodity prices and favorable currency movements.  It too warned of near-term various uncertainties.

Looking at European economic data, the German ZEW is due at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), and will be the first post-coronavirus indicator of sentiment in the eurozone’s largest economy. Investing.com has predicted a drop in the key economic sentiment indicator to 21.5 from 26.7.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore on Tuesday announced around $4.5 billion in financial packages to help contain the coronavirus outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact, paving the way for its biggest budget deficit in at least 15 years.
The wealthy city-state, one of the countries outside China hit hardest by the virus, has already cut its economic growth outlook this year and flagged the possibility of entering recession.
As the island nation prepares to hold an election due by early next year, the government also said in its annual budget that a planned hike in the goods and services tax would not take place in 2021 given the economic uncertainty.
""The outbreak will certainly impact our economy,"" Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said. ""We will put in every effort to slow down the spread of the virus.""
Other budget highlights included an S$8.3 billion multi-year scheme to help Singapore become a global hub for tech firms, a S$5 billion fund to protect the island s coasts from rising seas, and a plan to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040.
It also said it would set aside S$6 billion to help households offset an eventual rise in goods and services tax due by 2025.
BIGGER THAN SARS
The virus package involves S$800 million ($575 million) to fight and contain the disease, mainly through healthcare funding, and a further S$5.6 billion ($4 billion) in economic stimulus measures to manage its impact on businesses, jobs and households.
The economic measures include support for businesses to manage wage bills, corporate tax rebates, schemes to help firms in the hard-hit tourism and aviation sectors and cash payouts for households to manage expenses.
The government is budgeting for an overall budget deficit of S$10.9 billion, or 2.1% of GDP, in FY2020, the highest since at least 2005 - the last year covered by the government s statistics website. It estimated a deficit of S$1.7 billion, or 0.3% of GDP, in FY2019.
Singapore tends to be conservative in its fiscal forecasts. During the 2009 financial crisis, it forecast a S$8.7 billion deficit, but the actual shortfall was just S$819 million.
The Southeast Asian city-state has reported 77 cases of coronavirus and was also one of the worst hit countries outside of China during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak.
""The impact of COVID-19 is probably going to be bigger than SARS because China was relatively less important to Singapore s exports and tourism,"" said Lee Ju Ye, an economist at Maybank, referring to the disease s technical name.
""Now, it s hitting the global supply chain and Singapore s manufacturers are going to feel the heat."""

(Reuters) - European shares dropped on Tuesday as a revenue warning from Apple Inc  sent shockwaves through the tech sector, hammering iPhone parts makers and underlining the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global supply chains.
Apple s Frankfurt-listed shares  dropped nearly 5% after the company said it would miss its March-quarter sales outlook due to the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,800 people and forced businesses to shut operations.
Shares of STMicroelectronics NV  and Dialog Semiconductor , which supply components to Apple, fell 2.7% and 5.5%, respectively.
The technology-heavy German stock index (GDAXI) plunged 0.8%, while the European tech index (SX8P) fell 1.4%.
While the European tech index has risen more than 7% this year on hopes of demand recovering on the back of easing global trade tensions, the virus outbreak may reverse those gains given China s large presence in the technology supply chain.
""There are hundreds of other companies who are in this predicament, with manufacturing as well as stores in China,"" said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at wealth manager Mirabaud.
""The main effect of Apple having gone first will be to force others to follow soon or risk being accused of a cover-up.""
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.6% by 0951 GMT, having ended at a record high on Monday after China outlined fresh stimulus measures to mitigate the virus  economic impact.
However, Apple s  warning, along with news of a slower-than-expected recovery in the firm s Chinese factories, swiftly culled any optimism.
Other China-exposed sectors in Europe, such as automobile (SXAP) and basic resources (SXPP), dropped more than 1% each. The two depend heavily on Chinese demand for their goods, with several car makers also manufacturing parts in the country.
Bucking the trend, Italian stocks (FTMIB) rose on the back of bank shares after  Intesa Sanpaolo   made a surprise 4.86 billion euro ($5.26 billion) bid for smaller rival UBI Banca . UBI surged nearly 22% and was the top gainer on the STOXX 600.
British lender  HSBC Holdings   fell 4.7% and was one of the biggest drags on the STOXX 600 after it said it would shed $100 billion in assets and cut 35,000 jobs over three years in a drastic overhaul.

Defensive sectors such as utilities (SX6P) and real estate (SX86P) were among the few gainers."

Investing.com -- Germany’s ThyssenKrupp, one of Europe s industrial blue-bloods, is in a race against time to sell its most valuable asset before being swallowed by its debts – and it’s just had to hobble itself in the process.
The group announced on Monday that it would seek to sell its elevators unit to one of two private equity consortia, rather than to Finnish rival Kone Oyj . Kone subsequently withdrew its bid, which was reported to be over 1 billion euro higher than either of its rivals at more than 17 billion euros ($18.4 billion).
As a result, Thyssenkrupp  shares were down 6.3% by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) at a four-month low, underperforming the broader market on a down day for markets spooked by a warning from Apple  about the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on sales.
The German Dax was down 0.7%, while the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.5% at 430.02.
Thyssenkrupp  has opted for a sale that it knows will get approval from regulators, rather than one that was likely to be bogged down for months by an antitrust investigation. Between them, Thyssenkrupp and Kone have around 30% of the world market for elevators. A combination would have increased concentration in an already concentrated business. Regulators are particularly anxious when a market goes from having four major players to having three, which is what a TK/Kone combination would have done.
It was a close call, though. Thyssenkrupp  and Kone are the number 3 and 4, respectively, in their field, behind Otis and Schindler. The U.S. has just waved through a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, who have similar positions in the U.S. wireless networks market. However, the more relevant analogy is with the failed Siemens-Alstom rail merger, rejected by the EU Commission because of the near-monopoly it would have created within Europe.
Thyssenkrupp  does not have the luxury of waiting to see which way Commissioner Margarete Vestager s thumb will turn. It has been haemorrhaging cash due to a misjudged expansion in Brazil, chronic margin compression from Chinese steel exports to Europe, a downturn in the auto market and a crushing pension burden (which only gets heavier the longer than the European Central Bank’s interest rates stay below zero).
Even before its announcement on Monday, Moody’s Investor Service had downgraded the company’s long-term credit rating to B1 – “highly speculative” – in the wake of first-quarter earnings that included a horrific 2.5 billion-euro cash outflow before asset disposals.
“The magnitude of the earnings decline and cash drain in Q1 2020 was more severe than anticipated,” Moody’s warned, adding that TK s targets for the fiscal year through September appear “increasingly ambitious.”

TK now has a shortlist of two buyers: a consortium of Blackstone , Carlyle  and Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board; and on the other hand, Advent and Cinven."

SAN FRANCISCO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc s  surprise warning that it will likely fall short of this quarter s sales target due to the coronavirus epidemic points to much pain for its chip and other suppliers as well as for rivals who also rely on China to build their products.
Revising guidance set just three weeks ago, the world s most valuable tech company said while many factories that make iPhones have reopened for work, they were ramping up more slowly than anticipated.
The outbreak, which has infected more than 72,000 and prevented many employees from returning to work due to travel and quarantine restrictions, was reverberating throughout the U.S. firm s supply chain, a source familiar with Apple s operations in China said.
""If one component factory stays closed and they re the only supplier, then everyone has to stop and wait. And if there are two suppliers and one is shut down, then we need the other to do more,"" said the source who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified.
Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst, said Apple s woes probably also mean fewer chips will be sold throughout the mobile device industry because the overwhelming majority are made in China.
""Maybe this is the wake up call. I would be astonished if Apple is the only one,"" he said. ""Every electronic supply chain runs through China in a big way.""Research firm Canalys estimates both Apple, which outsources much of its manufacturing to Taiwan s Foxconn (TW:2317), and rival Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] have 99% of their production in China. The world s No. 1 smartphone market is likely see sales halve in the first quarter due to the virus, analysts have said.
Chinese rivals Oppo,  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) and Vivo have 83%, 72%, and 65% of their production in China respectively.
Reuters reported last week that roughly 10% of Foxconn s workers in China have resumed production, while other plants in the country remain largely shuttered. Foxconn denied the reports in a company filing without elaborating.
A SLEW OF SUPPLIERS
Shares of Apple s chip suppliers fell on the news on Tuesday, with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) losing 2.8%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) down 2.9% and SK Hynix (KS:000660) shedding 2.9%.
Analysts at ANZ noted  Qualcomm Inc   was vulnerable to disruptions caused by the epidemic as it supplies mobile modem chips to almost all major smartphone makers and generates nearly half of its sales from China.
U.S.-based suppliers that do a lot of business with Apple include Broadcom Inc ,  Qorvo Inc   and  Skyworks Solutions Inc  .
Broadcom makes a range of wireless components for iPhones and said last month it had signed a deal to supply Apple for contracts worth as much as $15 billion. Sales to Apple accounted for 20% of its annual revenue in fiscal 2019.
Qorvo, which sells parts that help phones connect to wireless data networks, generated around one third of its revenue from Apple in fiscal 2019. Skyworks, another wireless component supplier, got more than 10% of its annual revenue from Apple.
Other U.S. suppliers to Apple include Texas Instruments Inc . Its battery charging chips have been found in iPhone teardowns, although the company sells across a broad spectrum of the electronics industry.
In Europe, the Netherlands   NXP Semiconductors   supplies Apple with the near-field communications chips used in the iPhone s Apple Pay contactless payments feature, according to TechInsights teardowns and industry analysts.
Chips made by Franco-Italian firm STMicroelectronics   are used for wireless battery charging and for infrared cameras in iPhones, according to teardowns. Its shares lost 3.5% in morning trade.
Investors in chipmakers have until now have been willing to look past temporary coronavirus disruptions, hoping for a sales recovery in the second half, said Bernstein s Rasgon.
Mike Fawkes, who previously ran supply chain operations for Hewlett-Packard, said even if it wanted to, Apple was unlikely to find alternative production sources soon."

Investing.com -- Apple  warns of a hit to sales from the Covid-19 virus, sending shockwaves through global markets. China says it will allow waivers of tariffs on some U.S. imports as it struggles to support its economy. Walmart  reported Q4 sales below expectations, and markets are in risk-off mode as weak data out of Germany and the U.K. and dismal numbers from HSBC amplify Apple s warning. The outlier is Italy, where there s a bank merger frenzy going on. Elsewhere, Jeff Bezos announced a $10 billion Climate Change fund, partially answering questions as to why he s been selling so much Amazon  stock recently. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, February 18th.

1. Apple infected by Coronavirus
Apple  warned that it would miss its sales targets for the current quarter due to Covid-19 outbreak, the biggest western industrial company yet to make such a statement. It cited lower sales in China itself, which accounts for around 20% of iPhone sales, and production constraints in its supply chain.  
Extended travel curbs and quarantining mean that China’s factories are running at around half of their capacity currently, according to various reports, even though the official Chinese data continue to show a slowdown in the incidence of new infections and deaths.
Apple  didn’t update its sales guidance of between $63 and $67 billion, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty that spooked global markets on Tuesday.
2. China to waive tariffs as Pelosi bashes Huawei
China said it would allow companies to apply for exemptions from tariffs on a broad range of imports from the U.S., including agricultural goods such as pork, soybeans and beef, as well as energy imports such as crude oil and liquefied natural gas.
The moves, which go beyond what China agreed to in its Phase-1 trade deal with the U.S., appear aimed at keeping a lid on food and energy prices at a time when millions of Chinese workers are having to accept reduced pay checks due to Covid-19-related disruptions.
The announcement came only hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi underlined the breadth of U.S. hostility to China’s growing clout in telecommunications, telling reporters that ““If we were to let Huawei have the information-highway dominance, it would be like putting the state police in the pocket of every person who uses that highway.”

3. Stocks set to open lower; Walmart s disappointing Q4

U.S. stock markets are set to reopen after the holiday weekend sharply lower, as Apple’s warning reverberates through global markets. Disappointing holiday-quarter sales from Walmart are adding to the gloom.
Chinese stock markets had ended lower, with the blue-cap A Shares index losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy CSI 300 losing 0.5%, and most European markets had followed them. By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), the Stoxx 600 was down 0.4% at 430.10.

The Dow 30 futures contract was indicated down 156 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 contract was down 0.7%.

Other markets were also in risk-off mode: the yield on the U.S. 30-Year Treasury bond fell below 2% and gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,590.35 an ounce. U.S. crude oil futures fell 1.5%.

The tone wasn t helped by a weaker-than-expected ZEW sentiment index out of Germany and a drop in average earnings growth in the U.K.
4. Europe’s banking sector is on the move - just not in the same direction.

HSBC said it would cut 15% of its workforce and take over $7.2 billion in restructuring charges after profit fell 53% in 2019. HSBC stock fell 6.1% in London to a two-week low.
HSBC said it will slim down its investment bank – especially in the U.S. – to concentrate on more profitable activities. Another source of concern was that the bank still hasn’t found a permanent CEO to replace John Flint.

Elsewhere, Italy’s banks rode a wave of merger speculation after   Intesa Sanpaolo   , the country’s largest domestic lender, made an all-stock offer worth 4.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion) for smaller rival UBI Banca . Intesa stock rose 2.6%, while UBI stock rose 23%. Others lifted by the speculation included Banco Bpm  stock (+7.2%) and   Mediobanca    (+2.0%).

Cynics suggested that Intesa moved in order to make it harder for the government to pressure it into taking over perennial basket-case Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  (+3.4%).
5. Bezos launches $10 billion fund to tackle Climate Change
Amazon.com  founder Jeff Bezos said he would set up a $10 billion philanthropic fund to counter the effects of Climate Change.
The ‘Bezos Earth Fund’, as it will be known, will back scientists, activists, non-government organizations and any other effort that “offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world,” and will be separate from Bezos’ commercial investments in experimental new energy technologies."

Citigroup  Inc . said that markets are overconfident in expecting a v-shaped recovery and oil prices are likely to remain weak during the first half of the year. The outbreak has curbed travel and hit supply chains across the world, with Chinese refineries continuing to trim processing rates and Apple Inc . saying it won’t be able to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower smartphone demand.
At least two trading houses have rented crude-oil storage tanks in South Korea, while others have looked into storing supplies at sea, as the disease threatens to foster a glut.
Brent oil rallied the past five days -- the longest run of gains this year -- amid optimism the worst economic impacts of the coronavirus had been accounted for. China pledged a raft of fiscal stimulus measures to offset the disruption, and Singapore planned to boost spending to counter the slowdown in tourism and trade.
“The short-covering rally failed to gain traction, with the overhang of supply weighing on the market,” said Ole Sloth Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “Activity is slowly picking up, and while oil demand for storage has remained robust, the demand for products remains low. The market will have to live with this being -- at best -- a W-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped one.”

Brent for April settlement fell $1 to $56.67 on the ICE  Futures Europe exchange as of 10:56 a.m. in London after closing 0.6% higher on Monday. West Texas Intermediate futures for March delivery traded 77 cents lower from Friday’s close at $51.28 a barrel. There was no settlement Monday due to the Presidents’ Day holiday in the U.S."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Tuesday, as investors return from a holiday to the shock news from tech giant Apple  that it wouldn’t meet its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China.

At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 0.5% lower, futures for the Nasdaq were down 0.8%, while the Dow Jones futures contract lost 0.6%. U.S. equity markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.
Apple , the world s most valuable technology firm, said earlier Tuesday that it would not meet the revenue guidance, provided in late January,  for the second quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand due to the outbreak of Covid-19 in China. 
Apple  was expected to be hard hit, given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China. But it didn’t update its sales guidance of between $63 and $67 billion, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty that spooked investors.
“As production in China is ramped up more slowly than previously anticipated and the effects on the global tech supply chain become evident, equity investors might have to brace themselves for more negative news,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 

In China earlier Tuesday, the death toll from the virus climbed to 1,868, including one of the most senior doctors in the Wuhan region where the virus was first detected , The number of people infected topped 73,000.

Moody’s has downgraded its growth forecast for China in 2020 to 5.2%, from 5.8% previously, due to the outbreak.

Elsewhere, asset manager   Legg Mason    will be in focus after the WSJ reported that Franklin Resources  is in talks to buy its rival. Legg Mason has a market value of more than $3.5 billion and has assets under management of $800 billion.

In earnings news, Walmart  disappointed with its earnings and revenue numbers for the holiday quarter, and its guidance also came in below expectations. Expectations were low after rival   Target    disappointed over the same period, but Walmart stock still traded 1% lower premarket.

The economic slate is largely empty Tuesday, with only the Empire State Manufacturing index due at 8:30 AM ET and the NAHB housing market index at 10 AM of note.
Oil markets have sold off again Tuesday as China s extended travel restrictions point to a sustained drop in demand.
AT 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $51.36 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.1% to $56.48."

SAN FRANCISCO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd s (KS:005930) semiconductor manufacturing division has won a contract to make new  Qualcomm Inc   5G chips using its most advanced chip-making technology, two sources familiar with the matter said, boosting the Korean firm s efforts to gain market share against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TWO:5425).
Samsung will fabricate at least some of Qualcomm s X60 modem chips, which will connect devices such as smart phones to 5G wireless data networks. The X60 will be made on Samsung s 5-nanometer process, the sources said, which makes the chips smaller and more power-efficient than previous generations. 
One of the sources said TSMC is also expected to fabricate 5-nanometer modems for Qualcomm. Samsung and Qualcomm declined to comment, and TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Best known among consumers for its phones and other electronic devices, Samsung is the world s second-biggest chip manufacturer through its foundry division, self-supplying many of its own mobile phone parts and also fabricating chips for outside customers such as International Business Machines Corp  and  Nvidia Corp  , among others.
But much of Samsung s semiconductor revenue historically has come from memory chips, whose prices can swing wildly as supply and demand fluctuate. In an attempt to cut its reliance on that volatile market, Samsung announced a plan last year to invest $116 billion in non-memory chips through 2030.
The Qualcomm deal shows progress in winning customers to that effort. Even if Samsung has won only part of the orders, Qualcomm represents a flagship customer for Samsung s 5-nanometer manufacturing technology. Samsung plans to ramp up that technology this year in an attempt to regain market share against TSMC, which is also starting mass production of 5-nanonmeter chips this year.
The Qualcomm win could boost Samsung s foundry business because the X60 modem is likely to be used in many mobile devices as they shift to 5G. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Samsung had 17.8% market share versus TSMC s 52.7%, according to data from TrendForce.
In a separate announcement, Qualcomm said on Tuesday it would begin sending samples of the X60 chips to customers in the first quarter of this year. Qualcomm did not disclose who would manufacture the chips, and Reuters could not learn whether the first batches of chips would be made by Samsung or TSMC.
The Taiwanese company was faster to ramp up high-volume production of chips using the previous 7-nanometer manufacturing process, winning customers such as Apple Inc .
Last month, TSMC executives said they expect to begin ramping up 5-nanometer production in the first half of the year and expect it to make up 10% of the company s revenue for 2020. 
Asked during a January investor conference call how Samsung will compete with TSMC, Shawn Han, senior vice president at Samsung Foundry, said the company planned to expand 5-nanometer mass production by ""diversifying customer applications"" this year.

Qualcomm designs its own chips but works with outside companies to manufacture them. It has used manufacturing services from both Samsung and TSMC in the past, as well as from China s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981), depending on which foundry s technology and pricing met its needs for the product at hand."

A deterioration in the outlook for China saw bets for world economic expansion fall for the first time since October, in BofA’s poll conducted Feb. 6 through Feb. 13. A net 18% of respondents forecast stronger growth over the next 12 months versus 36% in January’s survey, according to a note.
Newsflow on the virus outbreak has whipsawed markets since the start of 2020, with Apple Inc .’s sales warning the latest sign that corporate and economic damage may be greater than expected. Still, risk assets have fared well in February and global stocks last week hit a new record high, boosted by mostly positive earnings reports and a dearth of alternatives to equities.
While the latest BofA survey showed investor sentiment less optimistic than in January, strategists led by Michael Hartnett said they stay “irrationally bullish.”
Polled fund managers expected upside for U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 seen peaking at 3,470, or 2.7% above the Friday close. The bullish conviction is underscored by bets that 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will stay within the current 1.4% to 2% range in the first half of 2020.
Coronavirus appeared as the third-biggest tail risk in the survey after the bond bubble and U.S. presidential election.
BofA’s February global survey had 194 participants with $632 billion in assets under management.

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street approaches the 20th anniversary of the piercing of the dot-com bubble, today s decade-old rally led by a few small players shows some similarities that cautious investors are keeping an eye on.
March 11, 2000 marked the beginning of a crash of overly-inflated stocks that would last over two years, lead to the failure of investor favorites including Worldcom and Pets.com and take over 13 years for Wall Street to recover from. 
Nasdaq s journey back to highs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HkmAPV
That bust ended a 1,000% decade-long Nasdaq (IXIC) rally that had been fueled by low interest rates and a rush to invest in the emerging World Wide Web, often at any cost.
Tracking the Nasdaq s ""horsemen"" - https://tmsnrt.rs/38f2RNs
Now, after hitting a record high on Feb. 13, the Nasdaq has reached over 9,700 points, almost double its high point in 2000 and about eight times the level of its trough in 2002.
Among the so-called ""Four Horsemen"" of tech stocks that fueled much of the 1990s tech rally, only Microsoft s  stock price has recovered from the dot-com bust. Intel  and Cisco Systems  remain below their 2000 highs, while Dell, the fourth member, has since been taken private and then relisted on the stock market.
The 1990s  remaining horsemen - https://tmsnrt.rs/2USpp2A
Microsoft is dueling with Apple  for the title of Wall Street s most valuable publicly listed company, with its stock quadrupling since CEO Satya Nadella took over as chief in 2014 and refocused the maker of Windows on cloud computing, a technology central to the current rally in Silicon Valley stocks. 
With a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion, Microsoft is now trading at over 30 times expected earnings, its highest valuation since 2002, but still less than half of the highest PE it reached during the dot-com era.
Intel and Cisco, no longer among Wall Street s most-favored tech stocks after investors refocused on software, are trading at PEs in line with recent years.
Apple, Amazon , Google parent Alphabet  and Facebook  have seen their PEs climb recently, but still within ranges seen in recent years as they drove much of the S&P 500 s rally.
S&P 500 and tech PEs since dot.com era - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SLGJDL
But across the stock market, earnings multiples are testing levels that followed soon after the dot-com bubble exploded. The S&P 500 s forward PE recently hit 18.8, its highest since 2002. At 22.5, the S&P 500 tech index s PE is at its highest since 2004, but still nowhere near its peak PE of 48 in 2000.
With Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and other technology companies fueling much of Wall Street s rally since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, some investors worry the market has become vulnerable to any downturn among those companies. 
Shares of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook alone make up about 18% of the benchmark S&P 500.
""While the levels of valuation are not as extreme, the conclusion is somewhat the same from the market standpoint. If for whatever reason these names falter, it s going to be very hard for certainly the Nasdaq, which is even more heavily weighted, but even the broader market, the S&P ... to perform well,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.
Tech market share of the stock market - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UQvb4V
At the height of the dot-com era, technology stocks accounted for over 35% of the S&P 500 s value. Today, the tech sector accounts for about 25% of S&P 500 market capitalization, according to Refinitiv Datastream. But combining the tech sector with the communications sector, which includes Internet-related companies like Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix , the group accounts for 35% of the S&P 500. 
The spate of unprofitable companies seeking to go public in recent years had struck some investors as similar to the dot-com boom. But WeWork s spectacular failure to pull off a multibillion-dollar IPO last year was seen as a positive sign for those concerned about an overly ebullient market and investors  willingness to buy shares of companies with no clear path to profitability.
More recent worries have been sparked by massive -- and to some investors, confusing -- gains for Tesla . The electric vehicle maker s stock price has soared 90% in 2020 alone.
“Watching Tesla this last week felt a lot like the bubble,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China reported on Tuesday its fewest new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should still be viewed with caution.
Apple Inc  warned that its sales would suffer as the epidemic hurt both its supply in China and its demand, an announcement that knocked the wind out of global stock markets.
For more Reuters coverage of the Coronavirus, click: https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484
The head of a leading hospital in China s central city of Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the disease first appeared at the end of last year.
Chinese officials reported 1,886 new cases - the first time the daily figure has fallen below 2,000 since Jan. 30 - bringing the mainland China total to 72,436. A figure of 98 new deaths marked the first time the daily toll in China had fallen below 100 since Feb. 11, bringing the total to 1,868.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data ""appears to show a decline in new cases"" but any apparent trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"".
Outside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.
China says figures showing a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.
But Tom Wingfield, a senior lecturer and physician at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: ""It is too early to be certain whether this represents a sustained reduction in COVID-19 transmission and that the epidemic has peaked."" 
The numbers appeared encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain s University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.
""Though it is unrealistic to reduce the transmission rate to zero it may have been reduced to a level where the epidemic is brought under control,"" Woolhouse said.
""It may be that epidemic is simply running its natural course, and is starting to run out of new people to infect. It could also be that the unprecedented public health measures introduced in China are having the desired effect.""
Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.
GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS
While China says its lockdown of cities and tough curbs on travel and movement have limited the spread of the virus, this has come at great cost to its economy, with repercussions for global businesses.
Stock markets had nonetheless roared ahead, boasted by expectations of stimulus measures to keep China s economy humming. But Apple s warning it would fall short of guidance for quarterly revenue because of slower iPhone production and weak Chinese demand sent markets lower.
""We have been pointing out that the market reaction in past weeks was excessively constructive and this could be a wake-up call to all investors that ignored so far potential negative impact,"" analysts at UniCredit said.
Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.
Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.
""The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we ll see a big round of layoffs,"" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.
Firms in China s services sector and small manufacturers are bearing the brunt of the impact so far. When cameraman Mark Xia returned to his job this month after holidays, the Shanghai video production house where he worked told him to take three months  leave with no pay. He is looking for a new job.
""I understand the company s cash-flow is tight,"" Xia, 25, told Reuters. ""We postponed some shooting due to the coronavirus outbreak, and that s had a huge impact on our revenues. That s the reality.""
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.
Singapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.
Singapore Airlines Ltd said it would temporarily cut flights in the three months to May, as the epidemic hits demand for services touching and transiting the key travel hub.

Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell at the opening on Tuesday, as a warning from Apple and disappointing figures from Walmart  validated fears that stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves in pricing in a quick end to the Covid-19 outbreak.
Apple  stock fell 2.7% after the iPhone maker warned of a two-fold hit to revenue, first from a drop in retail sales in China and secondly due to production constraints in its supply chain. It wasn’t able to give any clearer update on the expected impact of the virus, but warned it would not reach the $63 billion lower end of its guidance range.
Walmart  stock, by contrast, recovered from early losses to be up 0.5% after missing expectations for fourth-quarter sales. While its guidance for 30% online sales growth also represented a slowdown from last year’s 37%, markets took the view that the possible leakage of business to Amazon.com  isn’t as bad as it might be.

By 9:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 113 points or 0.4% at 29,303. The S&P 500 index was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.

Sentiment was supported somewhat by the release of the Empire State Manufacturing index, which rose by more than expected to its highest level since May last year.
Among the biggest gainers was Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, which rose 12.6% to a new record high of $32.20. It’s now tripled since its IPO last year, and has doubled since the middle of January, when fears about the Covid-19 outbreak began to weigh on the broader market.
The company hasn’t released any financials in that time, suggesting that the rally is in large part stoked by speculative interest looking for a growth story to rival Tesla .
Tesla  stock was up another 7.0%, approaching the peak of last week’s spike, helped by a Reuters report that it is in talks with China’s CATL to use cobalt-free batteries in the cars made at its new factory in Shanghai.
Theoretically, taking cobalt out of the value chain could cut production costs. However, Reuters also cited a source as saying it has no plans to abandon the use of its current nickel-cobalt-aluminum battery technology.
Elsewhere, Franklin Resources  stock rose 7.6% and Legg Mason stock rose 23.6% after the two companies agreed to combine in a deal that values the latter at around $4.5 billion. 
Oil and gas stocks again came under pressure after U.S. crude futures snapped their winning streak, losing 0.9% to $51.83 a barrel amidst lingering concerns about the travel restrictions still in force in China, and Russia’s refusal – so far – to sign up to deeper production cuts along with OPEC."

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Gold prices touched $1,600 an ounce on Tuesday for the first time since the scare over a conflict between the U.S. and Iran at the start of the year, after a warning from Apple  about a hit to sales revived fears of a global economic slowdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak. 

Apple had warned of a twofold hit to iPhone sales, with depressed footfall in its Chinese stores compounded by production constraints in its supply chain. The warning fleshed out anecdotal reports that the Chinese economy is still only functioning at around half of capacity owing to extensive restrictions on people returning to work after the Lunar New Year holidays.
By 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), gold futures for delivery on the Comex exchange were up 0.9% at $1,600.05, while spot gold was up 1.0% at $1,597.39.

Trading appeared dominated by demand for uncorrelated assets after the Apple news sparked a selloff in global stocks and in commodities such as oil and base metals. U.S. crude, nickel and zinc futures all fell more than 1%. Cryptocurrencies also traded mostly higher.

There were also gains in government bonds, with the United States 30-Year Treasury yield falling at one point to within three basis points of a record low of 1.95%. By 11:15 AM ET (1615 GMT), it was trading around 2.00%. German 10-Year yields also fell below -0.40% again. 

U.S. two-year yields fell two basis points to 1.39%, a level that reflects expectations of at least one more interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. However, there was little sign of that coming in the day’s economic data, which showed the Empire State Manufacturing index rising to its highest level since May and the NAHB housing market edging down only slightly to 74 from 75 in January.

European data were less encouraging, with the German ZEW sentiment index falling more than expected, and U.K. average earnings growth slowing down – something that keeps the possibility of an interest rate cut at the Bank of England’s next policy meeting alive.
Carsten Mumm, chief economist at German private bank Donner & Reuschel, argued in a morning note that risk assets have become detached from the actual economy, pointing to the increased likelihood of economic contraction in Europe’s largest economy due to the coronavirus.
“The situation in the real economy hasn’t been reflected in prices for a long time, rather, they reflect the general lack of alternatives to low interest rates,” Mumm said.

Elsewhere, silver futures rose 2.5% to a three-week high of $18.18, while palladium – another uncorrelated asset – rose 7.8% to another all-time high, stopping just short of the $2,500 level.

COVENTRY, England (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak hits firms across countries and industries. 
Britain s biggest carmaker, which operates three car factories in its home market making nearly 400,000 vehicles a year, joined major global companies such as Apple  in warning of the impact of the virus on supply chains.
 Fiat  Chrysler  said last week it had temporarily halted output at its Serbian plant, the first such suspension by an automaker in Europe in response to the health crisis. 
Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world and Hubei province - the center of the virus outbreak - is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.
""We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing,"" Chief Executive Ralf Speth told reporters at the official opening of the National Automotive Innovation Center in Coventry, central England. 
""We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK,"" he said.
Production at the firm s Chinese factory would recommence on Feb. 24 and was ""safe for the very first week"", he added. 
The new coronavirus has killed some 1,900 people in China and infected around 72,000, confining millions to their homes, disrupting businesses and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. 
Speth said sales in China, the world s biggest auto market, had been hit. That comes after JLR had seen a recovery in sales there, helping it to return to profitability in recent quarters. 
""That s completely stopped. It s zero,"" he said. ""You don t know whether the economy will catch up or whether this kind of loss is just a loss."" 
The boss of Tata Motors , JLR s parent company, speaking at the same event, said its Indian suppliers did not have sufficient visibility regarding parts from China.

""We are safe for the month of February and for a good part of March,"" said Guenter Butschek. ""Are we fully covered at this point of time for the full month of March? Unfortunately... not."" "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering changing U.S. regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] from companies such as Taiwan s TSMC (TW:2330), the world s largest contract chipmaker, two sources familiar with the matter said.
New restrictions on commerce with China s Huawei are among several options to be considered at high-level U.S. meetings this week and next. The chip proposal has been drafted but its approval is far from certain, one of the sources said. 
The measure would be a blow to the world s no. 2 smartphone maker as well as to TSMC, a major producer of chips for Huawei s HiSilicon unit and mobile phone rivals Apple Inc  and  Qualcomm Inc  . 
""What they’re trying to do is make sure that no chips go to Huawei that they can possibly control,” the second source said.
Huawei is at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China. The United States is trying to convince allies to exclude its gear from next generation 5G networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim. 
To target global chip sales to Huawei, U.S. authorities would alter the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects some foreign-made goods based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations.
Reuters reported possible changes to that rule in November. 
Under the draft proposal, the U.S. government would force foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment to seek a U.S. license before supplying Huawei - a major expansion of export control authority that could anger U.S. allies worldwide. 
The U.S. Commerce Department declined to comment on the proposal.
But a Commerce spokesman said recent U.S. charges against Huawei, including conspiring to steal trade secrets, ""reaffirm the need for caution in considering license applications. The U.S. continues to have major concerns about Huawei.""
Huawei did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for TSMC said the company does not answer ""hypothetical"" questions and does not comment on individual customers. 
The United States placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year, citing national security concerns. That forced some U.S. and foreign companies to seek special licenses from the Commerce Department to sell to it, but China hawks in the U.S. government have been frustrated by the vast number of supply chains beyond their reach. 
Others in the Trump administration fear antagonizing Beijing, which just signed a trade deal with Washington. They also worry the restrictions will drive innovation offshore and benefit foreign rivals.
Most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies like KLA , Lam Research  and Applied Materials , according to a report last year from China s Everbright Securities. 
""There is no production line in China that uses only equipment made in China, so it is very difficult to make any chipsets without U.S. equipment,"" Everbright wrote.

Shares of KLA and Lam fell around 4 percent in U.S. trading on Tuesday."

Investing.com – Wall Street fell Tuesday on fresh worries about the impact of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak on global growth after Apple  warned that the virus would stall iPhone demand and production in China.

The S&P 500 fell 0.48%, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.20% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.72%.

Apple said it will miss its fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance range of $63 billion to $67 billion, sending its shares more than 2% lower.

Some on Wall Street, however, maintained their optimism on Apple amid expectations the impact on revenue will likely be temporary.

""We assume that, as with every other company operating in China, the situation on the ground continues to evolve for Apple. We are reducing our forecasts for both the March and June quarters, but we see this as a temporary issue for Apple ,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note

Still, revenue warning raised fears about the performance of the tech giant s supply chain disruptions, with chipmakers in particular coming under pressure.

Broadcom , Skyworks  and Micron  fell more than 1%, keeping the broader tech sector in the red.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, led the decline in Wall Street, paced by a fall in oil prices amid lingering fears about the virus  impact on Chinese oil demand.
Beyond virus jitters, the final wave of earnings also garnered investor attention.

Walmart  climbed nearly 1% after shrugging off weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results, which it blamed on softer-than-expected performance over the holidays.

  Advance Auto Parts    reported earnings that topped consensus estimates, sending its share about 7% higher.

Elsewhere, Tesla  resumed its run higher, rising about 6%, after analysts on Wall Street raised their price targets on the electric automaker.

Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Tesla  to $500 from $360 (and to $1,200 for its bull case) and Bernstein upped its price target to $730 from $325.

More than 54,000 shares worth about $14 million of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, or SOXX, traded before markets opened in New York -- the most in two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund sank 1.5% at 12:53 p.m. Monday in New York, largely trailing the broader stock market. Trading in the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF, or SMH, also surged.
For the second time in as many years, Apple had to temper its sales outlook because of unexpected shifts in China, the country that’s served as the engine of its growth and success. First, there was a trade war with the U.S. and now there are concerns over a novel coronavirus that resulted in some manufacturing delays and retail-store closings in the Asian nation. While analysts argue that the impact from the outbreak would be temporary for both the tech giant and its suppliers, for now, the worries are sinking the industry’s shares.
Tech More Volatile Than Broader Market Amid Apple Warning: Chart
“In the near term, it’s going to be a volatile sector,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “If those factories are offline too long, you’re going to see some of these companies come out and cut revenue and earnings for the year. And the initial shock of that news coming out will cause a pretty big pullback in semiconductors.”
That’s the latest sign that the coronavirus could have a larger impact on economic growth than first anticipated. The virus is the third-biggest tail risk after the U.S. presidential election and a bursting of the bond “bubble,” according to Bank of America Corp .’s fund-manager survey conducted this month. The poll released Tuesday showed global growth expectations for the next year has tumbled to a net 18% from 36% in January, driven by a drop in sentiment toward Chinese output.
“That’s an area that could be ripe for investors to be nosing around at,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management. “The market is taking it out on some of the semiconductor stocks, partly because they are cyclical stocks and global growth matters a lot to cyclical stocks.”"

Shares of the company backed by billionaire Richard Branson have taken off in popularity among individual investors in recent sessions, nearly displacing Tesla Inc , another favorite among non-professional investors.
Virgin Galactic was the third most traded stock on Fidelity s online brokerage in recent sessions, with two thirds of clients buying shares, rather than selling. Orders for Virgin Galactic on Fidelity trailed only Apple Inc  and Tesla.
Fanning enthusiasm around space tourism on Tuesday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk s SpaceX announced plans https://spaceadventures.com/space-adventures-announces-agreement-with-spacex-to-launch-private-citizens-on-the-crew-dragon-spacecraft to send up to four private citizens on an orbital voyage aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft, launched on its Falcon 9 rocket.
Virgin Galactic is racing against SpaceX and Amazon  CEO Jeff Bezos  Blue Origin to bring tourists into space, but is the only one of the three whose shares are publicly listed. That makes Virgin Galactic the only option for stock market investors who want to buy into the emerging business of space travel.
 Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas, who has an ""overweight"" rating on Virgin Galactic, cautioned in a note on Tuesday that the recent surge has been ""driven by forces beyond fundamental factors.""
""We are very constructive on the Virgin Galactic story ... We just think the share price could use a breather,"" Jonas wrote, maintaining his $22 price target.
Virgin Galactic has over 600 reservations and $80 million in deposits for 90 minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket.
The shares received a boost last week after Virgin Atlantic moved its SpaceShipTwo vessel to its operational base in New Mexico. Attached to its carrier aircraft, VSS Unity was flown from its manufacturing facility in California.
The move to ""Spaceport America,"" a purpose-built commercial spaceport, lets it begin final stages of test flights, according to Virgin Galactic.
The hypersonic surge in Virgin Galactic follows a recent rally in Tesla shares, another stock wildly popular among non-professional investors. Fueled by improved profitability, the electric carmaker s stock has surged over 150% since early December, including a 6% rise on Tuesday.
Just three analysts cover Virgin Galactic, all of them rating it the equivalent of ""buy,"" according to Refinitiv. Their median price target is $19, compared to Tuesday s price of $35.70."

By Barani Krishnan 
Investing.com – Gold broke through the $1,600 ceiling Tuesday after a revenue warning from Apple  saw funds flee from risk and into safe havens.
Palladium, meanwhile, returned to record highs after more than a month’s break, as fresh worries about short supplies in the auto-catalyst metal drove prices to new peaks.
The $1,600 milestone achieved by both bullion and futures of gold capped six weeks of attempts by gold bugs to return to the perch last hit when U.S.-Iran tensions spiked.
Gold futures for April delivery on New York’s COMEX settled Friday’s trade settled up $17.620, or 1.1%, at $1,603 per ounce. The session high was $1,608.15, a peak not seen by COMEX gold since Jan. 8.
Spot gold, which tracks live trades in bullion was up $20.46, or 1.3%, at $1,601.26 by 2:55 PM ET (19:55 GMT). Bullion earlier hit a six-week high of $1,605.35.
Stocks and other risk assets fell as U.S. markets reopened from the President’s Day holiday, amid Apple’s warning that the Covid-19 outbreak will prevent it from meeting its Q2 revenue forecasts due to production and sales slides in China, the manufacturing hub and second-biggest market for iPhones.
“Apple’s warning on sales affected by the coronavirus is raising interest in reexamining the global economic pullback on the epidemic,” said George Gero, precious metals analyst at RBC Wealth Management in New York. “All this is adding to the safe-haven appetite for gold.”"

Treasuries rose and the dollar strengthened.
The S&P 500 Index eased off a record high as the iPhone maker warned of production and demand disruptions due to the epidemic, while gains for  Microsoft Corp  ., Amazon.com Inc . and  Facebook Inc  . pushed the Nasdaq 100 slightly higher. Apple suppliers including Dialog Semiconductor Plc and AMS AG helped drag down European stocks. HSBC Plc tumbled the most since 2009 after it said it will slash jobs in a restructuring, while also flagging risks from the virus.
Government bonds climbed, while the euro weakened after a German investor-confidence index plunged. Gold rallied.
Investors are still trying to judge the corporate and economic impact from the coronavirus, even as the growth rate of cases in China’s Hubei province -- the epicenter of the disease -- continues to stabilize. It’s a turnaround from Monday, when sentiment was lifted by Chinese policy makers’ moves to support companies hit by the prolonged shutdown of large parts of the country. BHP Group said commodity prices will take a hit if the fallout extends beyond the end of next month.
“The market has largely ignored what’s going on with the coronavirus in terms of what impact it might have, but I’m not sure that’s entirely appropriate,” said Jeff Mills, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. “It’s likely to be temporary and the economy may bounce back, but this is different than what we saw with SARS. China is a much larger more entwined piece of the global economy.”
Elsewhere, equity benchmarks in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong saw declines of over 1%. The Australian dollar weakened after the Reserve Bank of Australia said it reviewed the case for a further rate cut at its last meeting, but didn’t go ahead. Emerging-market stocks and currencies fell.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq eked out a gain Tuesday after Apple  clawed back some losses as investors bet that the Covid-19 impact on the tech giant s revenue will be temporary.

The S&P 500 fell 0.29%, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.02% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.56%.

Apple said it would miss its fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance amid a coronavirus hit to iPhone demand and production. Its shares closed 1.8% down after falling by more than 3% intraday.

Still, the warning on revenue sent shockwaves across the supply chain, with chip stocks in particular showing weakness. Lam Research  dropped 4% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  fell 3.5%.

Downside in the broader market, however, was kept in check by positive quarterly earnings.

Walmart  climbed 1.5% after shrugging off weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results, which it blamed on a softer-than-expected performance over the holidays.
  Advance Auto Parts    reported earnings that topped consensus estimates, sending its share about 6% higher.
Kroger , meanwhile, surged 5% after Warren Buffett invested $549 million in for a 2.4% stake in the company.

Energy stocks fell 0.8%, pressured by early weakness in oil prices amid fears about the virus  impact on Chinese oil demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after a sales warning from Apple left investors assessing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on U.S. companies.
But indexes ended off the day s lows and the Nasdaq ended a touch higher as Apple Inc  trimmed its losses in late-session trading.
The world s most valuable technology firm said it would fall short of its recently announced quarterly sales target because of slower iPhone production and weaker demand in China due to the virus. Its shares ended down 1.8% at $319, while its low of the session was $314.61.

""In general, investors are not overly concerned by the news from Apple as a read through to technology or the market overall.""
While the exact hit to economic and earnings growth from the epidemic in China remains to be seen, hopes that the damage would only be temporary have helped boost confidence on Wall Street in recent sessions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall over the languishing euro and heavily sold exporter currencies on Wednesday, as investors reckoned with a deepening economic fallout from the coronavirus.
The new coronavirus has caused 2,004 deaths in China and infected more than 74,000 people, while measures to contain it have paralyzed the economy and the supply chains it feeds.
Apple Inc  has warned it will probably miss its March quarter sales guidance amid disrupted production and shopping habits. Car makers are idling plants for lack of parts.
The yield curve between U.S. three-month bills and 10-year notes inverted overnight, a bearish economic signal, and German investor confidence slumped as its economy stagnates, sending the euro cheaper than $1.08 for the first time since 2017.
""The market is trying to model itself on coronavirus and it s struggling really hard to understand how that goes and that s pushing capital in to the U.S.,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""The U.S. remains that least-dirty T-shirt, the best house in a fairly shabby-looking neighborhood. As a destination for capital, it s still the light that you look for.""
Against a basket of currencies, the greenback is sitting by a four-month high at 99.452 (=USD). It touched a one-week high against the Australian and New Zealand dollars overnight.
Both Antipodean currencies are heavily exposed to China, and both have lost roughly 5% against the dollar this year  . Norway s krone, sensitive to the global growth outlook via oil exports, has shed 6% in 2020 and slumped to an 18-year low overnight .
The euro (EUR=) has fallen 3.7% amid increasing signs of divergence between the European and U.S. economies.
The single currency last bought $1.0796. Moves in major currencies were slight in morning trade.
China says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show the aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.
That has not stopped worries mounting, with hedge funds turning to proxies from railway movements to port activity and air pollution to try and gauge how much production remains offline.
Gold is sitting above $1,600 an ounce for the first time since U.S.-Iran tensions in the Middle East sent it spiking in early January . Priced in euros, gold s value jumped almost 2% to a record high overnight (XAUEUR=R).

Palladium continued it’s record-breaking rally.
Bullion steadied after surging 1.3% Tuesday’s as Apple Inc .’s warning that the virus and efforts to contain it would have its sales missing forecasts spurred a sell off in stocks. China’s death toll from the disease topped 2,000, while the province at the center of the outbreak reported fewer additional cases. The flight to safety has benefited haven assets, with the rally spilling over to the palladium market, where a multi-year deficit is expected to widen in 2020.
Gold is up 5.7% this year as investors assess the impact of the disease on economic growth and appetite for risk amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will feel increased pressure to reduce interest rates. The U.S. central bank has said the effects of the virus have presented a “new risk” to the outlook and traders will study minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, due later Wednesday, for any hint of a dovish tone.
Spot gold added 0.2% to $1,604.82 an ounce at 9:14 a.m. in Singapore. Prices had touched $1,611.42 in early January, the highest since 2013, as geopolitical tensions flared. The unfolding health emergency has seen holdings in global exchange-traded funds backed by bullion expand to a record. Palladium climbed 2% to $2,680.31 an ounce, an all-time high.
“A deficit equivalent to about 20% of the palladium market is expected to be sustained this year, helping explain the surge in prices,” said Vivek Dhar, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Demand is being driven by environmental regulations, particularly in China, which has increased palladium use in vehicles and should offset any recent weakness in car sales, he said."

LONDON (Reuters) - A decline in the number of new coronavirus cases in China and mounting expectations for more policy stimulus boosted global stock markets on Wednesday, helping ease some of the alarm caused by an Apple  revenue warning.
China posted the lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases since Jan. 29, helping to lift the offshore-traded yuan to two-week highs against the dollar and pushing the yen to a one-month low.
Many view Chinese data on the virus with scepticism, but sentiment was lifted by a Bloomberg report that Beijing was considering cash injections or mergers to bail out airlines hit by the virus.
Those steps would come after this week s cut in the medium-term lending rate, which has fed expectations for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate.
A pan-European equity index rose 0.4% to test recent record highs and futures indicated a stronger open for Wall Street. Earlier, an MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan rose 0.5%. Japan s Nikkei index gained almost 1%, helped by the yen s retreat.
Chinese mainland shares closed in the red, however. 
Edward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald, cited President Xi Jinping s latest commitment to meeting 2020 growth targets.
""This in itself implies there will be more fiscal and monetary stimulus,"" Park said. ""That s the real carrot for markets today.""
Tuesday s U.S. Empire manufacturing survey also reassured investors the world s biggest economy was in good shape, he said. That somewhat tempered worries caused by Apple s warning it might miss sales targets because of pressure on its supply chains.
Market fears still kept gold trading above $1,600 an ounce and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields some 35 basis points below where they started 2020.
""There is some nervousness that economic data outside the United States is not amazing,"" Park said.
China, the world s second-largest economy, is struggling to get manufacturing back online after severe travel restrictions were imposed to contain the coronavirus. Japanese exports fell for the 14th straight month in January, data showed. 
Growth worries were reflected in a dismal German investor sentiment survey and the U.S. Treasury curve, where yields on three-month bills rose above yields on 10-year notes -- an inversion that s been a fairly reliable recession predictor in the past.
The yield on three-month bills stood at 1.5949%, above the 10-year yield of 1.5661%.
Investors are waiting to see what other growth-supportive measures could be introduced, particularly in the euro zone. They will also keep an eye on the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve s last meeting. 
The Fed has signaled that it s keeping an eye on the coronavirus impact but has no intention of cutting interest rates anytime soon. Many analysts reckon it could be forced to change its mind.
""Given the risks we see to both growth and inflation falling short of expectations this year, we still expect the Fed’s view on the need for additional rate cuts to shift later this year,"" NatWest analysts told clients, adding they were ""not at this time removing rate cuts from our forecast.""
But the contrast between euro zone and U.S. economic indicators are weighing on the euro, which has reached a three-year low versus the dollar, though it rose back above the $1.08 level it breached on Tuesday for the first time since 2017.
Brent crude futures rose around 0.7% to $58.12 a barrel, as a reduction in supply from Libya offset concerns about weaker Chinese demand.

Investing.com -- Wall Street returned to risk-on mode at the opening of trade on Wednesday, shrugging off the growth concerns triggered by Apple’s warning over the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.
Stronger-than-expected data from the housing market in January continued to support sentiment, while the market was largely unconcerned by a sharp rise in producer prices that drove annual factory gate inflation to its highest level since May.

By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 91 points, or 0.3%, to stand at 29,323 points. The S&P 500 index was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
Among the biggest gainers was, again, Tesla  stock, which rose 6.7% to a new high of $916, after analysts at Piper Sandler raised their target price to $928, citing the commercial potential of its electricity generation and storage businesses. 
Apple  rose 0.6%, making good around one-third of the losses that it made on Tuesday after warning that it wouldn’t meet its revenue target of $63 to $67 billion in the first three months of this year.

Hydrogen fuel cell company   Plug Power    continued to ride a wave of hot money flowing into alternative energy stocks, rising 4.6%, while Virgin Galactic  continued its parabolic trajectory, also fueled overwhelmingly by retail investors in search of the next big thing. 

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has an “overweight” rating on Virgin Galactic, cautioned in a note on Tuesday that the recent surge has been “driven by forces beyond fundamental factors.”
“We are very constructive on the Virgin Galactic story ... We just think the share price could use a breather,” Jonas wrote, maintaining his $22 price target.
Elsewhere, the dollar index rose further to a new three-month high of 99.61, while gold futures also hit a seven-year high before retreating slightly to $1,607.25 a troy ounce. U.S. crude futures, meanwhile, rose 1.2% to $52.94 a barrel."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq rallied to record highs on Wednesday as reports of a slight decline in Covid-19 cases and hopes for additional stimulus from China prompted investors to resume their bullish bets on stocks.

The S&P 500 rose 0.62%, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.01% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.53%.

China reported 1,749 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the lowest number of newly-confirmed cases since Jan. 29, stoking investor optimism that the spread of the virus was slowing.

Also adding to the positive backdrop on Wall Street, Bloomberg reported that Beijing was considering cash injections or mergers to bail out airlines hit by the virus.
Tech powered the broader rally in stocks, led by a 1.7% rise in Apple  as easing virus jitters gave credence to bullish calls from analysts, many of whom had downplayed the tech giant s warning that it will miss second-quarter revenue guidance.
Chip stocks also welcomed a wave of buying, with Nvidia leading the charge higher following a bullish note on the chipmaker from Wall Street.

Bernstein upgraded its rating on Nvidia  to outperform from market perform and hiked its price target on the company to $360 per share from $300 per share, sending its shares to an all-time high, up 5%.
The return of risk appetite triggered selling in U.S. government bonds, sending prices lower and yields higher, pushing bank stocks higher.
JPMorgan , Bank of America  and Goldman Sachs  rose more than 1% as a rise in bond yields tends to boost net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.

With investor hopes growing that efforts to control the virus are gathering pace, oil prices found their footing, triggering a rebound in energy stocks following a selloff a day earlier.  
On the earnings front, investors had to contend with mixed quarterly results.
Garmin  surged 8% after its fourth-quarter results topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Blue Apron  reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell well short of consensus estimates, sending its shares down more than 19%.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates where they are until mid-2020 but may then need to cut them, Minneapolis Fed Bank President Neel Kashkari said on Wednesday, pointing to the coronavirus in China as one potential risk to the U.S. economy.
""If I were to guess, I’d guess we’re probably going to sit here for the next three months, next six months, maybe longer,"" Kashkari told a symposium in Mankato, Minnesota.
""But if I were to guess what the next move would be, my best guess is the next would be down rather than up, because we are pretty close to neutral today, and there are any number of shocks around the global economy that could hit the U.S. economy and call for lower rates.""
One such shock, he said, could come from the impact of the coronavirus that in China has killed more than 2,000 people, sickened more than 74,000, and slowed or stopped industry in many of its cities.
Though China s government has reported a slowdown in new infections, Kashkari said he looks at such data ""with somewhat of a skeptical eye.""
""China’s economy is a big engine,"" Kashkari said. ""It’s unlikely that if this continues that we are going to be completely immune to the economic effects of the virus in Asia.""
Most Fed policymakers have similarly warned that the spread of the disease, and the efforts to contain it through restrictions on travel and other means, could disrupt global supply chains, and already some U.S. companies including Apple Inc  have said they expect profits to slip as a result.
Kashkari said the impact from the virus could deliver a negative ""shock"" that could force the Fed to lower rates from their current target range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
Last year the Fed reduced rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to shield the U.S. economy from the effects of a global slowdown and trade uncertainty that has since eased with the signing of a partial U.S.-China truce on their tariff war."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When clients tell financial adviser Catherine Valega that they want to invest their money in women, they are not always clear what they mean. 
To be honest, there is no real answer yet.
If you have less than $1 million, investing with a gender lens typically means buying shares in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that pick stocks with the goal of advancing the interests of women. For direct investments in women-led firms or businesses focused on women s issues, you have to meet the high minimum investments of impact venture capital funds. 
There are now some 35 options of gender lens funds. Total assets invested in gender account for $2.4 billion, according to a 2018 report on gender lens investing from Veris Wealth Partners. That is up from eight options and just $100 million four years ago. In contrast, there are some 10,000-plus other funds in the general market. 
Most investors do not put their whole portfolio through a gender lens. For one thing, the options are extremely limited for retirement plans, because they do not have long enough track records or enough assets to be considered. 
So those who participate are mostly allocating a portion of their Roth IRAs or taxable brokerage accounts to gender funds, said financial adviser Liz Windisch of Denver. Only one of Windisch s clients so far has wanted to go all in.
""She was sitting on a lot of cash for a long time, because she didn t want to support companies that sold guns or tobacco,"" Windisch said. ""We worked up to:  Wouldn’t you rather have your money work for you, but also put that money where your values are?  "" 
For now, most of the clients that work with advisers like Valega, who is based near Boston, and Windisch are stepping in cautiously and not fixated on garnering outsized returns. This is a long game for them. 
""I am a big believer in investing in companies that are doing the right thing, I do see them outperforming over the long term,"" Valega said. 
Windisch has yet to hear from a dissatisfied client who is worried over lagging returns. If they lost half, maybe she would get calls, she said, but, ""If it s 7% instead of 9%, it s not of concern.""
HOW IT WORKS
Two of the largest gender lens offerings are the Pax Ellevate Global Women s Leadership Fund , which launched in 2014 after a reorganization, and the  State Street   Gender Diversity Index ETF , which launched in 2016. 
In the case of Pax Ellevate, the fund starts with more than 1,600 companies in the MSCI World index, eliminating businesses involved in tobacco, weapons and fossil fuels, said Julie Gorte, senior vice president for sustainable investing at the fund. 
The remaining companies are ranked on gender issues - how many women are on the board, women in top leadership positions, adoption and implementation of the Women s Empowerment Principles of the United Nations, how friendly are their HR policies toward women and pay equity. The top three holdings are Microsoft ,  Best Buy   and  Estee Lauder  .
The minimum to purchase shares in the global fund is $1,000. The fund currently has more than $500 million in assets. The company has a range of other funds, including bond funds, multi-asset funds and separately managed accounts. 
The global fund, for one, has been closely aligned with its index, and beat its three-year benchmark, with an expense ratio of .81%e, up nearly 44% versus 41% for the index. The fund is up more than 3% for 2020 versus 2.7% for the index. 
Other options include Domini Impact Investments, which aims to do more than just buy stock in the companies that meet their criteria, but also to advocate through shareholder proxies for more change. The firm offers a domestic equity fund , an international equity fund  and a bond fund . The minimum investment is $1,500. The top holdings include Microsoft, Apple  and Alphabet Inc . 
""As an investor you have a voice, you can engage in dialogue with companies or you can vote your proxies in a way that sends strong signal to management,"" said Carole Laible, CEO of Domini Impact.

What women really want to know is what difference their dollars are making, Laible said, adding her answer: ""We have reports that show here s the difference you made this year. That s the next frontier."" "

(Reuters) - U.S. satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp on Wednesday posted fourth-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations as it lost fewer pay-TV subscribers.
Dish has struggled to retain pay-TV subscribers as it repositions itself as a wireless phone carrier, because customers are shifting to online streaming services including those from Netflix Inc , Walt  Disney   Co and Apple Inc .
Dish s pay-TV business, which includes satellite TV and streaming service Sling TV, lost a net 194,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, fewer than the 334,000 lost a year earlier.
Sling TV had 94,000 fewer subscribers in the quarter, its first subscriber loss ever.
Net income rose to $389 million, or 69 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates of 59 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total revenue fell 2.1% to $3.24 billion from $3.31 billion in the year-ago quarter, beating analysts  average estimate of $3.15 billion.
Dish stands to benefit from the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint Corp, which received the final green light from a federal judge last week. The merger includes Dish acquiring Sprint s prepaid phone businesses and T-Mobile cell towers to create the fourth-largest U.S. wireless carrier.
The merger puts Dish in the race for the next generation of wireless service. Dish said it would cost $10 billion to build out its virtual 5G network, which relies less on company-specific hardware and software for upgrades.
Some analysts were skeptical about Dish s estimate.
""Sure, virtualization will help significantly reduce Dish s cost of equipment,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a note.
But ""equipment is only 20% or so of the cost of building a network,"" he added, saying labor, tower leases and zoning and other expenses could exceed $10 billion.
Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen pushed back on criticism during an earnings call, saying Dish s 5G strategy makes the company ""a different animal.""
""Some big incumbents today spend as much money in a year or two just to maintain their networks as we ll spend to build the network,"" Ergen said.
The company did not disclose its strategy on the call, but estimated spending $250 million to $500 million for its wireless build-out in 2020, half of its prior forecast for 2019 and 2020."

Gains for chipmakers and banks led the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite toward records after Bloomberg News reported that China’s latest moves to aid growth include possible bailouts for hard-hit industries. The dollar climbed to a four-month high after data on housing starts and building permits exceeded analysts’ estimates. Treasuries held steady after minutes showed Federal Reserve officials viewed monetary policy as appropriate “for a time.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index reached new highs, and shares rose in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. The yen fell to a nine-month low on concern Japan’s economy may slip into a recession. Oil gained as U.S. sanctions on Russia’s largest producer and conflict in Libya put the focus on supply threats.
Investors appear relatively confident in the ability of policy makers to contain fallout from the deadly coronavirus, even after Apple Inc . spooked markets earlier this week by warning of a slowdown in sales. Data released Wednesday showed the the housing market remains a bright spot for the U.S. economy amid sluggish business investment.
“Housing is an economic bellwether and seeing data like this gives investors a lot of reasons to be optimistic, at least for the U.S. market,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers were cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold interest rates steady this year, minutes of the central bank s last policy meeting showed, even as they acknowledged new risks caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
The readout on Wednesday of the policy discussion, at which policymakers unanimously voted to keep interest rates unchanged in a target range of between 1.50% and 1.75%, also showed Fed officials were skeptical about any big rethink of the central bank s inflation target.
""Participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favorable than at the previous meeting,"" the Fed said in the minutes of the Jan. 28-29 meeting. It went on to say the current stance of monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate ""for a time.""
Coming into this year the Fed had made clear that, after three interest rate cuts in 2019, it plans to hold interest rates steady, barring a significant change in the U.S. economic outlook.
Policymakers have pointed to U.S. consumer spending levels, dissipating U.S-China trade tensions and loose financial conditions as supporting their view, but how long such an upbeat assessment can last has already been tested by escalating concern about the global economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak that started in China.
On Monday Apple Inc  issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the epidemic is causing to its supply chain. China, the world s second-largest economy, is still struggling to get its manufacturing sector back up and running after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain the flu-like virus. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week it was too early to tell if the knock-on economic impact on the United States would be severe or sustained enough to cause the Fed to change its current path.
Since the outbreak began investors have brought forward their bets of when the Fed will cut interest rates again, to around June of this year. In the minutes, policymakers said the threat ""warranted close watching.""
Despite that, Fed officials offered a fairly upbeat assessment of the economy, expecting consumer spending to ""likely remain on a firm footing,"" job gains to expand at a healthy pace, continued moderate economic expansion and inflation returning to its 2% goal. The Fed is forecasting the economy growing 2.0% this year. 
That is at odds with some economic data released since the meeting. The Commerce Department reported last week a slowdown in consumer spending in January. Business investment has also experienced a deepening downturn and the U.S. manufacturing sector remains weak.
As part of a discussion on rethinking the Fed s inflation goal during the central bank s review of its main policy tools, there were vocal doubts about adopting an inflation range.
""Most participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range ... could be misperceived as a signal that the Committee was comfortable with continued misses below its symmetric inflation objective,"" the Fed said. 
BALANCE SHEET
Elsewhere in the minutes, Fed policymakers discussed how to handle its growing balance sheet. The Fed has been buying $60 billion monthly of U.S. Treasury bills since October to increase the level of reserves in the banking system in response to a liquidity crunch.
Powell has said the Fed would aim to begin scaling back that amount sometime in the April-June period, when the level of reserves in the banking system would likely be deemed adequate.
After that, ""regular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate trend growth in the Federal Reserve s liabilities and maintain an ample supply of reserves,"" Fed policymakers noted in the minutes.
The Fed also expects to continue offering support in the market for repurchase agreements, or repo, at least through April but in the minutes staff floated a plan that included phasing out the term repo operations after April. Those policymakers who commented on the plan were comfortable with the idea, according to the minutes.

Several policymakers asked for more discussion ""before long"" on the possibility of creating a standing repo facility, which would allow banks to borrow cash as needed at a fixed rate."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Wednesday on hopes of fresh stimulus from Beijing to curb the coronavirus impact, which is showing signs of slowing in China.

The S&P 500 rose 0.47%, the Nasdaq Composite surged 0.87% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.40%.

China reported 1,749 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, marking the lowest number of newly confirmed cases since Jan. 29 and the second-straight day infections have remained under 2,000.

The update arrived as the Bank of China hinted at fresh stimulus to fend off the impact of the virus, with reports suggesting that easing may be delivered as soon as Thursday.

""The fundamentals of China s economy have not changed,"" the People s Bank of China said. ""China s economy, however, also faces several challenges but will fend off major financial risks.""

Easing Covid-19 fears triggered a wave of green across energy stocks amid a climb in oil prices, setting up the broader market for a record day.

In tech, chip stocks rallied strongly as investors bet that supply chain disruption would be limited after China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reportedly vowed to help businesses that were impacted.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed 2.6% higher, led by a 6% rise in Nvidia .

Bernstein upgraded its rating on Nvidia to outperform from market perform and hiked its price target on the company to $360 per share from $300 per share, sending its shares to an all-time high.

Tesla  also supported the rally after Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock to $928 from $729, sending the electric automaker s shares up 6.9%.

Apple , meanwhile, clawed back the bulk of losses from a day earlier, when it warned on revenue on concerns that the virus would hurt iPhone demand and production. Shares closed up 1.45%.

Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology firms, making Ireland s Data Protection Commission (DPC) the EU s lead regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation s (GDPR) ""One Stop Shop"" regime introduced in 2018.
The new rules give regulators the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4% of a company s global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.
In its annual report, the DPC said two of the 21 inquiries it had open into big tech firms by the end of 2019 had moved from the investigative stage to the decision-making phase.
They related to a 2019 investigation into a bug in Twitter s Android app, where some users  protected tweets were made public and a 2018 probe into the transparency of WhatsApp s data sharing with Facebook  and its fellow subsidiaries.
Facebook has come under most scrutiny since the new rules came into force in mid-2018 with eight individual probes, plus two into WhatsApp and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.
Twitter and Apple  are subject to three inquiries each. Google , Verizon  Media, Microsoft  owned LinkedIn  and U.S. digital advertiser Quantcast made up the rest of the cross-border investigations at the end of last year.
The DPC has since launched a second inquiry into Google, relating to its processing of location data, and a first probe into the Match Group  Inc s Tinder dating app.
Under GDPR, the DPC must share its draft decision with all concerned EU supervisory authorities and consider their views in its final verdict. Each of the bloc s regulators may be called on for a majority decision if agreement cannot be reached among the relevant member states.
A report last month showed European regulators had imposed just 114 million euros in fines for data breaches since GDPR came into force.
The DPC defended the process, saying there would be little benefit in mass producing decisions only to have them overturned by the courts.
""A new legal framework and one that contemplates very significant penalties is always going to take time to implement correctly,"" Helen Dixon, the head of the DPC, said in the annual report."

SHANGHAI/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Blocked highways. Stranded workers. Dwindling supplies. Shipping and air freight companies also hamstrung.
The Chinese manufacturing engine that powers much of the world economy is struggling to restart after an extended Lunar New Year break, hindered by travel and quarantine restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus epidemic and still in place in many parts of the country.
Case in point: in the southern China manufacturing hub of Dongguan, a factory that makes vaporizers and other products had just half of its workforce of 40 last week and was struggling to function without key personnel.
""The quality inspectors, they re all out,"" said Renaud Anjoran, who runs the factory. ""One is stuck in Hubei, the other is in an area with no transportation open.""
Anjoran said other Dongguan manufacturers were also scrambling with half their normal staff levels, with some having even less than that.
The problems are exacerbating pain inflicted by loss of business from the U.S.-China trade war and present huge logistical challenges as companies, many dependent on migrant workers, grapple with a myriad of restrictions that differ by province, city and local district.
Apple Inc  on Monday rescinded a quarterly sales target made just weeks ago, saying the ramp up of factories in China was slower than anticipated.  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) have had to suspend some production - not just in China but also at home - for lack of parts.
Some smaller firms, particularly in Southeast Asia and reliant on supplies from China, are having to make tough decisions.
Taiwan s Sica New Materials abruptly shut its factory in Thailand at the end of January, laying off about 350 workers.
""They couldn t produce because raw materials weren t being sent from China,"" said Pairote Panthakarn from the government s welfare and labor protection office in Kanchanaburi province, where the factory is located. Sica New Materials did not respond to a request for comment.
Sinoproud Cambodia Garments Co Ltd, whose customers include fashion retailer Zara s parent  Inditex  , told Reuters it may scale back production as stocks of fabric were getting low.
""We hope we get the product in March and if we don t get the product in March, we might just have to cut back and put the workers on half pay,"" said general manager Tu Ailan.
Nearly half of 109 U.S. companies responding to a poll by Shanghai s American Chamber of Commerce said plant shutdowns have already had an impact on their supply chains, while almost all of the remainder expect an impact within the next month.
The outbreak, slow pace of business resumption and its impact on the global economy is set to dominate discussions at this weekend s G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Riyadh, though Chinese counterparts will not attend as they focus on efforts to limit the fallout.
The coronavirus, described by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva as a global health emergency and ""our most pressing uncertainty"" is set to knock 0.5 percentage points off global growth in the first quarter for a growth rate of 2.5%,  Morgan Stanley   economists estimate. They predict China s GDP will expand just 4.2% in the quarter from a year earlier, down from 6% in last quarter.
FREIGHT ACHES
Even if factories have enough workers, the transportation of supplies and finished goods has also been a major headache.
""The resumption of motor transport is very slow and curbs production,"" said an executive at a steel mill in the eastern province of Shandong, citing insufficient drivers and a plethora of checkpoints slowing down traffic.
""The situation is easing now, but total recovery might need to wait till the end of the month,"" said the executive who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to identified.
The shortage of workers at Chinese ports has resulted in fewer calls from container shipping lines, a situation likely to result in months of delivery delays, while some air cargo firms such as Lufthansa  have reduced services in response to crew health concerns and uncertain demand.
FedEx Corp  told Reuters it was starting to see a slow pick-up in demand and that it was in discussions with many local governments as there were different restrictions in different cities.
The magnitude of the challenges presented by the new coronavirus crisis is much greater than SARS in the early 2000s, said Karen Reddington, president of FedEx Express Asia Pacific.
""China is so much more connected, the fact that China now represents so much of the world s economy I think that s why, it seems so much more impactful at this time,"" she said.
Mathieu Montelon, general manager of France s Bigben Interactive, which makes smartphone accessories in the southeast province of Guangdong, said the disruptions underscored the complexity of inter-connected supply chains.
""Even when the factory is in a position to open and take orders, their subcontractors might have issue with other local authorities, so they cannot open, or they don’t have the workers,"" he said.
He added that Bigben is switching up the mix of products it offers retailers, pushing goods made in other countries less affected by the virus.
Others are looking at more drastic action, accelerating a broader shift of production out of China that took off with the trade war.
Anjoran, the operator of the factory in Dongguan, is considering setting up a second assembly center in Mexico to serve U.S. customers with minimal reliance on China."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple iPhone maker Foxconn (TW:2317) said on Thursday it is cautiously restarting production at its main plants in China and warned revenue will be hurt this year by the coronavirus epidemic.
The statement comes just days after Apple  rescinded its March quarter sales guidance, saying factories in China have been slower to get back to work than first anticipated after Lunar New Year holidays were extended amid the outbreak.
Foxconn, the world No. 1 contract manufacturer, also said its plants in countries such as Vietnam, India and Mexico continue to operate at full capacity with expansion plans under way as it seeks to minimize the impact of the virus.
In mainland China, manufacturers are grappling with a logistical nightmare as many of the workers they depend on cannot return to work, hindered by travel and quarantine restrictions. The restrictions, which differ by province, city and local district, have also made it difficult to transport goods. 
Foxconn did not elaborate on how big the impact to revenue might be or give an estimate.
Analysts have forecast the Taiwanese company made some $11.9 billion in revenue for 2019, before the outbreak was known to have spread widely. It is due to report fourth-quarter revenue in March.
Reuters reported this month that Foxconn could see a big impact on production and the company was utilizing factories in other countries to fill the gap.
The company, formally called  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, hopes to have production levels in China at half of normal levels by the end of February, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week.
Foxconn said the Reuters reports were not factual but did not go into detail. 
KGI, a Taiwanese brokerage, estimates Foxconn s factories in China will be operating at 30% to 40% of normal production levels by the end of February and that its revenues this quarter could slump 46% from the fourth quarter.
Research firm Canalys estimates Apple and Huawei [HWT.UL], which is also a Foxconn client, have 99% of their production in China. Analysts have also said sales in the world s biggest smartphone market could halve in the first quarter.
TrendForce has slashed its forecast for Apple s iPhone production in the current quarter by 10% to 41 million units and warned it may revise down again by another 5-7% depending on how well factories in China ramp up production.

Shares in Foxconn have lost around 9% so far this year."

Investing.com - Apple s surprise warning that it would not meet its revenue guidance for the current quarter because of the coronavirus briefly sent tremors through global financial markets earlier this week.
The tech giant said Monday that all of its iPhone manufacturing facilities in China have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected.
Some of its retail stores in the country remain closed or are operating at reduced hours, which will hurt sales this quarter.
""Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter due to two main factors,"" the company said in a press release. 
In late January, Apple  had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March.
It did not offer a new revenue estimate nor provide a profit forecast.
The billion-dollar question: Is the financial fallout from coronavirus a short-term problem or a longer-term trend?
Analysts so far appear mostly unfazed by the Apple  coronavirus impact. The prevailing view is that the effect will be temporary, and that the company’s core strengths mean the medium- and long-term outlook remains good.
Investors appear to be taking the same view.
Apple  stock rose 1.4% on Wednesday, recouping most of the losses in the preceding session suffered in the wake of the surprise sales warning.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Lenovo Group (HK:0992), the world s biggest PC maker, posted a better than expected profit on Thursday and said its global operations would help it tackle short-term headwinds from China s coronavirus outbreak, sending its shares up 7%.
The Chinese company reported an 11% rise in net profit for its third quarter ended December to $258 million thanks to strong demand for its PCs and smart devices, beating an average $223 million estimate of seven analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose to a record $14.1 billion.
""The numbers are very good,"" said Christopher Yim, analyst at BOCOM International, adding that the PC business  profitability was impressive.
Lenovo is among companies facing disruptions to their supply chain after local governments in China extended a Lunar New Year holiday and imposed strict travel curbs to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
IPhone maker Apple  warned earlier this week it will not be able to meet sales forecasts for the current quarter as the virus outbreak was pressuring its supply chain.
One of Lenovo s biggest factories is in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where businesses remain shut.
A shortage of workers and difficulties faced by Lenovo s component suppliers are among the biggest bottlenecks, but the company was increasing production at overseas facilities it has in Brazil, United States, India and Japan to mitigate some of the impact, Lenovo s Chairman Yang Yuanqing told Reuters.
He said he was confident that the majority, if not all, of production at the firm s Shenzhen and Hefei facilities, which produce most of its PCs, would resume by the end of the month.
Given current infection trends, he is also optimistic that the company could see production fully recover by end-March. China reported on Thursday a sharp drop in new cases but the data was partly attributable to a change in how it diagnoses the virus, which has killed about 2,100 people and infected some 75,000.
Demand from China in the current quarter would be hit but the company would be buffered as the country only accounts for 25% of the company s overall business, he said.
""Another good thing is that this quarter is not Lenovo s peak quarter, the peak quarter was Q3, last quarter, so that means that the impact on our shipments would be less than last quarter even though we cannot 100% recover our capacity,"" Yang said.
The global PC market grew 2.3% in the quarter to December, as customers replaced machines to migrate to Windows 10, market research firm Gartner said last month. Lenovo took a 24.8% market share during the quarter, ahead of rivals HP Inc  and Dell, it said.
The year began on a positive note for Lenovo after an early January interim agreement between Washington and Beijing eased 18 months of U.S.-China trade tensions."

The move came after one trainee had close contact with a virus patient in the southeastern city of Daegu, the epicenter of an outbreak in South Korea. 
SK Hynix, the world s No.2 memory chipmaker which counts Apple Inc  and Huawei among its customers, said another trainee also had symptoms of pneumonia. The two trainees tested negative for the virus, but will undergo a second test.
A surge in confirmed cases linked to a local church in Daegu this week sparked fears of wider transmission.
The 800 include 280 trainees, who have not yet started working on production lines, and accounts for a fraction of its workforce of 18,000 people in Incheon, a spokeswoman said. 

SK Hynix has closed its training center and hospital in Icheon, southeast of Seoul."

While coronavirus fears triggered a worldwide sell-off in January, the losses proved short-lived. Global equities are trading near record highs on optimism that the impact from the epidemic will be limited and China will step up support for its economy. Goldman’s Peter Oppenheimer cautions against complacency.
“Equity markets are looking increasingly exposed to near-term downward surprises to earnings growth,” Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in a Feb. 19 note. “While a sustained bear market does not look likely, a near-term correction is looking much more probable.”
“Spillovers” from weaker Chinese demand are “dramatically more important” to regional and world economies compared with a decade or two earlier, and tourism alone accounts for 0.4% of global gross domestic product, according to Oppenheimer.
He estimates that a 1% drop in global sales-weighted GDP would cut European earnings by about 10%, turning them negative. The exposure of the Euro Stoxx 50 Index to China is about twice that of the S&P 500 due to such sectors as banks, automakers and luxury shares.
Companies too are starting to sound the alarm. Apple Inc . said this week it would miss its sales targets for the quarter because of the fallout from the coronavirus.  Pernod Ricard   SA last week cut its full-year growth forecast by about half, while today, Air France-KLM warned the outbreak will wipe as much as 200 million euros ($216 million) from earnings.
“In the context of relatively weak earnings growth, there’s probably too much complacency and we could see some negative earnings,” said Oppenheimer in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. “And valuations are vulnerable to a setback.”
While the odds of a short-term correction are high, the resilience of the global economic cycle is likely to be supportive for equity markets on a relative basis over the next year and beyond, according to Goldman."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, suggesting sustained labor market strength that could help to support the economy amid risks from the coronavirus and weak business investment.
There was encouraging news on the struggling manufacturing sector, with other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a three-year high in February, likely as tensions in the 19-month trade war between the United States and China diminished. 
Washington and China signed a Phase 1 trade deal in January.
But the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and Boeing s suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, continue to loom over the manufacturing sector.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve s Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers ""expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,"" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has also infected thousands globally.
""Manufacturing growth may be past its trough,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, looking ahead we continue to believe that activity will advance at a lackluster pace as global growth and trade policy headwinds are unlikely to significantly relent and the negative impact of the coronavirus will be felt via global supply chains interlinkages.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said. Last week s increase in claims was in line with economists  expectations. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week.
The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February s employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. 
The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects.
HEALTHY PACE
Wednesday s Fed minutes showed policymakers ""judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,"" and ""expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year."" Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. 
""Job market conditions may be softer at the margins, but layoffs remain quite low and employers remain generally content to maintain their existing payrolls,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index jumped to a reading of 36.7 in February, the highest since February 2017, from 17.0 in January.
The survey s measure of new orders received by factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, soared to 33.6 this month from a reading of 18.2 in January. While a measure of factory employment slipped, manufacturers increased hours for workers. 
The survey mirrored a report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing a measure of business activity in New York state jumped to a nine-month high in February, though the outlook over the next six months remained subdued.
Despite the signs of improvement the risks for manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, are stacked to the downside. Boeing s biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years hurt industrial production in January.
The coronavirus outbreak is disrupting global supply chains. Apple  warned on Monday it was would likely miss its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago because of the coronavirus epidemic, which is delaying reopening of factories in China after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.
The Philadelphia Fed survey s six-month business conditions index increased to a reading of 45.4 this month from 38.4 in January. Its six-month capital expenditures index fell to 29.8 from a reading of 32.9 in the prior month.

While manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region reported receiving higher prices for their products in February, they paid less for inputs."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – Wall Street moved off session lows but remained under pressure Thursday, paced by selling in tech stocks as investors continued to assess the Covid-19 virus outbreak.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.72%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.69%.

It wasn’t immediately clear what triggered the sudden move lower in stocks. But reports of a sharp increase in infections in Beijing dampened hopes that China’s capital would be able to resume normal operations sooner rather than later.

A hospital in Beijing has reported 36 new coronavirus cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in the capital city, taking the total cases to 45, Chinese state-run Global Times reported.
Beijing recently ramped up measures to prevent the spread of the virus including restrictions on movements and a ban on public gatherings that forced schools to shut down.

Tech led the broader decline lower amid worries about prolonged disruptions to supply chains in China at a time when several companies, including Apple , Procter & Gamble  and 3M , have cautioned on outlook as the virus outbreak continues.
A slew of mixed earnings from corporates before the open, meanwhile, did little to help sentiment on stocks.
Six Flags  slumped 18% after the theme park operator delivered a softer outlook on profit and cut its dividend by nearly 70% amid a surprise loss in the fourth quarter.

ViacomCBS  plunged 17% to a 52-week low after its earnings missed estimates and guidance was weak.
Zillow  bucked the trend, rising 19%, after its fourth-quarter losses were not as bad as Wall Street had estimates amid a ramp-up in activity on its housing platform.

In deal news,   Morgan Stanley    bought discount broker E-Trade  for $13 billion, sending shares of latter up 24%.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet  Inc-owned Google s $2.1 billion bid for fitness trackers company Fitbit could pose privacy risks, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) warned on Thursday, adding its voice to other critics of the deal.
Google announced the deal in November last year, as it seeks to compete with Apple  and Samsung (KS:005930) in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches. 
Fitbit, whose fitness trackers and other devices monitor users  daily steps, calories burned and distance travelled, would give the U.S. tech giant access to a trove of health data gathered from Fitbit devices.
Such access is worrying, the EU privacy watchdog said.
""The possible further combination and accumulation of sensitive personal data regarding people in Europe by a major tech company could entail a high level of risk to privacy and data protection,"" it said.
It urged the companies to assess their data privacy requirements and privacy implications in a transparent way and mitigate possible privacy and data protection risks before seeking EU antitrust approval for the deal.
Google said it would never sell personal information to anyone and that Fitbit health and wellness data would not be used for its ads while Fitbit users would have the option to review or delete their data.
""Protecting peoples  information is core to what we do, and we will continue to work constructively with regulators to answer their questions,"" the company said in a statement.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who will vet the deal, in November voiced her concerns about big companies targeting data-heavy rivals.
The European Commission on Thursday in an emailed comment said it had yet to be formally notified. 

""It is always up to the companies to notify transactions with an EU dimension to the European Commission,"" it said."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Apple  has become embroiled in a publishing row in Germany after it tried to halt sales of a book written by a former executive, saying it disclosed secrets about the App Store.
 App Store Confidential , by self-styled German rapper, ski instructor and marketing manager Tom Sadowski, is part autobiography and part self-help guide for Generation Z readers looking to navigate their way into the tech scene.
Until late last year, Sadowski was the head of Apple App Store in Germany. After his book was published in Germany this week, Apple wrote to Hamburg publishers Murmann Verlag demanding a halt to sales and a recall of copies already sold, according to extracts of a letter shared with Reuters by Murmann s lawyer Ralph Oliver Graef. 
""The operation of the App Store encompasses a multitude of business secrets,"" the iPhone maker said in its letter.
Yet, apart from a brief account of a visit by CEO Tim Cook to Berlin and tips on how app developers should pitch their wares to Apple, the book betrays few - if any - details over how the $1.4 trillion U.S. company does business.
""Apple is trying to obstruct the publication of a book that addresses its business practices, but is written very sympathetically,"" Graef said.
Murmann said a first print run of 4,000 copies was selling well and, rather than pulling the book, it was rushing out a second print run. ""It s No. 2 on the Amazon  best-seller list in Germany - everyone is talking about it,"" said Peter Felixberger, an executive at Murmann.
Apple, meanwhile, has not yet sought a court injunction on sales of the book. ""It looks like Apple has gone a bit far tactically, building up pressure and issuing threats but then lacking the courage actually to go to court,"" Graef said.
Apple said it had fired Sadowski for writing the book, although Sadowski said he left Apple last November and that his plans to publish the book only became known in December. 
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE
The 180-page book states at the outset that all the facts it contains are publicly available.
It then embarks on a chatty account of how Sadowski landed a job in 2010 at Apple to market its iTunes music service, before moving to become head of the App Store for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, a role he held from 2014 until he left the company.
Each chapter of Sadowski s book opens with words of wisdom from Apple s late founder, Steve Jobs, while the text is anything but revelatory. One highlight, the account of Cook s visit to a Berlin startup in 2017, contains no details of what was said at the meeting.
Sadowski said that a manuscript of his book was submitted to Apple in January.
""I really enjoyed working for Apple ... I never had any intention of betraying any secrets or harming Apple, as anyone who has read the book will tell you,"" Sadowski said in a written reply to a Reuters request for comment. 
""But I also believe in the freedom of the press and freedom of speech and that every person and every company is equal before the law, and therefore I resist Apple s demands.""
Graef said powerful companies like Apple ought not to be untouchable and should accept reporting about their business practices, referring to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling dating back to 1882 that no man should be above the law.
Apple said in a statement on Thursday that while it promoted a free press and supported authors, it had been left with no alternative but to terminate Sadowski over his first foray into book writing.
""All workers should have the reasonable expectation that employment policies will be equally and fairly applied and all companies should have the reasonable expectation that their business practices will be kept confidential,"" Apple said.
It declined further comment on the circumstances of Sadowski s departure.

Murmann, a 15-year-old publisher, specialises in issues like the impact of digital technology on society and environmental affairs."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – Apple s iPhone sales in China may fall sharply in the first quarter of the year, as its supply chain comes under siege from the coronavirus outbreak, an industry expert warned, casting doubt on Wall Street s bullish calls on the iPhone maker.

Apple  shares fell 1%.

Apple s iPhone sales in China may fall by 40 % to 50% in February and March, compared with the same period last year, as the Covid-19 outbreak has hurt sales of all mobile phone suppliers in China, Liang Zhenpeng, a senior industry expert, told the Global Times on Thursday.
The tech giant s suppliers are already feeling the pain, with Foxconn Technology warning that full-year revenue was expected to take a hit from disruptions to China-based manufacturing by the coronavirus.
Apple s OLED supplier, BOE, told the Global Times on Thursday they are yet to fully restore operations.

""The impact of the outbreak is certainly there and if our other business partners are affected, so are we,"" said a customer service representative with China s panel display-maker BOE. She noted the iPhone s LCD screens belong to the first-line products and its factory in Beijing has partially resumed production.
The warning signs for a potential protracted delay to iPhone production in China comes against somewhat bullish calls from Wall Street analysts earlier this week as they downplayed the significance of Apple s revenue warning.

Investing.com – The S&P recouped some losses following a sudden selloff Thursday, as investors reassessed the threat of the coronavirus on growth as reports of sharp uptick in infections in Beijing weighed on sentiment.  
The S&P 500 slipped 0.38%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.67% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.44%.
Over recent days, investors have cheered signs the spread of the coronavirus in China, named Covid-19, could be slowing, but reports of a sharp increase in infections in Beijing and outside of mainland China has gripped investor attention.
A hospital in Beijing has reported 36 new cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in the capital city, taking the total cases to 45, denting hopes that China, the world s factory, could resume normal activity.
Several companies, including Apple , Procter & Gamble  and 3M  have cautioned on outlook, forcing some to reassess expectations about the impact the outbreak will have on growth. Goldman Sachs  warned investors against taking the threat too lightly.
""In the nearer term...we believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high,"" Goldman Sachs  Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer told clients.
Tech was the worst hit, falling 1%, with chip stocks giving back gains from a day earlier and large-caps like Microsoft  and Google  parent Alphabet  adding to the broader downside move.

The U.S. Treasury official said it was too soon to make accurate forecasts for the impact of the virus on the global economy, but the base case scenario sees China s growth dropping in the first quarter and then rebounding sharply. The impact could be more significant if the outbreak worsens, the official told reporters ahead of this week s G20 meeting.
The International Monetary Fund said this week the epidemic had already disrupted economic growth in China and could derail a highly fragile projected recovery in the global economy in 2020 if it spread to other countries.
China s commerce ministry on Friday said January and February exports and imports would be hit by the coronavirus outbreak, but foreign companies in most places would resume production by the end of February.
Asked if the outbreak would require changes to the Phase 1 trade deal with China, the official said: ""At this stage, we re not expecting changes to implementation of Phase 1. ... We still expect them to meet their commitment, but it s over a period of time.""
Under the deal, which took effect this month, China pledged to increase U.S. goods purchases by $77 billion in 2020 and by $123 billion by 2021, compared with a baseline of U.S. imports from 2017, the year before the U.S.-China tariff war began.
Experts had expressed skepticism that China would be able to meet such aggressive purchase commitments even before the coronavirus emerged, while reports of new cases in China and elsewhere have further intensified fears over its impact on the global economy.
But the Global Times newspaper, which often speaks for the Chinese government, reported on Thursday that China was likely to buy 10 million tons of U.S. liquefied natural gas despite a gas glut.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will discuss the economic impact of the epidemic with senior finance officials and central bankers from the world s 20 largest economies (G20) in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Saturday and Sunday.
China said on Wednesday it was not sending senior central bank and Finance Ministry officials to the meeting because of the virus outbreak.
The Treasury official said lower-level officials would represent Beijing.
Mnuchin and the other G20 officials will also discuss efforts under way among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members to draft new international rules for taxation, with an eye to bridging ""significant gaps"" and reaching a multilateral consensus this year, the official said.
Washington plans to explain its proposal for a ""safe harbor"" that would allow companies to opt out of proposed reforms, the official said. That proposal has drawn sharp criticism from France and other countries and threatens to stall the reform drive.

The rules would affect big U.S. digital companies such as Alphabet Inc s , Google,  Facebook Inc  , Amazon.com Inc , Apple Inc  and China s  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd ."

Investing.com --  The coronavirus spotlight turns to Korea, while risk-off predominates in global markets: stocks are moving lower, while gold and bonds are hitting new highs. Business surveys out of Europe suggests the economy is in better shape than feared, but the dollar is giving up little of its gains this week. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, February 21st.
1. A new phase for Covid-19 outbreak
As cases of the coronavirus appear to approach their peak in China, attention is switching to other countries.
Of particular concern is South Korea, where the number of confirmed cases has risen threefold this week to over 200, making it the largest cluster of cases outside China and the Diamond Princess cruise ship that is docked off Japan.
The BBC reported that the southern cities of Daegu and Cheongdo have been declared ""special care zones"". The streets of Daegu are now largely abandoned, it added. All military bases are in lockdown after three soldiers tested positive.
Chinese companies have already reported extensive shutdowns due to problems with their supply chains in China, but the spread of the disease in Korea and Japan, both countries with advanced health care systems and high population density, is likely to give a reliable indicator of how easily – or not - the outbreak can be contained outside China.
2. Chinese car sales plummet; yuan hits new 2020 low
The short-term impact of the virus continues to work show itself on the Chinese economy, pushing the Chinese yuan to a new low for the year at 7.04 to the dollar.
New car sales fell 92% on the year in the first two weeks of February, according to industry body data.
On Thursday, the International Air Transport Association had warned that the global airline sector would lose $29 billion in revenue due to the outbreak, the worst hit coming in China and the broader Asian market.
3. Dollar Takes a Breather After PMIs
The dollar has come off multi-year highs against developed market currencies, after stronger-than-expected business surveys out of Europe took the edge off fears about another global economic downturn. 

The IHS Markit Composite purchasing managers index for the euro zone showed activity at its highest in six months, rising to a preliminary 51.6 from 51.3 in January.and defying expectations of a decline to 51.0. The U.K. composite PMI, meanwhile, also came in above expectations, staying at 53.3.

The pound and euro both came off this week’s lows in response. Sterling was trading at $1.2925 while the euro was back above $1.08 for the first time in three days.

The greenback continues to march higher against higher-yielding Asian currencies such as the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah, as well as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, widely seen as proxies for Asian commodity demand.
4. Stocks set to open lower
U.S. stocks are set to open lower again as corporate warnings about the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak finally appear to sink in.

Following Apple , Procter & Gamble  warned on Thursday that its earnings would take a hit from supply chain disruptions and weak demand in China, its second-biggest market.

By 6:45 AM ET (1145 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was down 89 points or 0.3% while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 contract was down 0.4%.
The S&P is on course for its first weekly drop in three, after Goldman Sachs  warned on Thursday that stocks were exposed to a correction after their recent surge.
5. Gold surges on risk-off; Fed speakers eyed
After swinging both ways in the first half of the week, haven assets of all stripes are showing more consistent signs of strength.

Gold Futures hit a fresh seven-year high of $1,639.25 an ounce overnight, while Silver futures rose to their highest in over a month.

Government bond yields continue to move lower. Germany’s benchmark 10-Year yield hit a new four-month low of -0.46% overnight, moving up only one basis point after the PMIs. U.K. 10-Year yields have fallen 4 basis points this week despite data all but ruling out an interest rate cut from the Bank of England.

U.S.  30-Year Treasury yields, meanwhile, hit a new all-time low of 1.905% overnight, before retracing up to 1.92%.

The rally is being fueled by investors pouring money into U.S. stocks and bonds amid expectations that the country will be less vulnerable to the economic fallout from the coronavirus, which already threatens to dent China s growth rate and push Japan and the eurozone into recession.
Investors seeking a comparatively safe place to put their cash amid uncertainty over the virus  trajectory and economic impact are also piling into the dollar. That effect has been heightened in recent weeks as concerns over Japan s economy have weighed on the yen, traditionally a popular destination for nervous investors.
Meanwhile, though yields on U.S. Treasuries have dipped, they continue to exceed those offered by other developed countries, increasing the dollar s allure to income-seeking investors.

""You get some of the best growth in the developed world, plus a yield,"" said Clifton Hill, global macro portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, which oversees $101 billion in assets.
Hill came into the year expecting a trade deal between the United States and China to benefit a wide range of assets around the world, but the strengthening dollar has pushed him to shift his view.
He is now betting the buck will rise against a range of Asian currencies including the Korean won and Thai baht, and positioned for a decline in various commodity prices, which tend to weaken when the dollar rises.

A stronger greenback is an unwelcome development for U.S. multinationals because it makes it more expensive for them to convert foreign earnings back into dollars.
Currency headwinds accounted for $11.55 billion in collective losses for North American companies in the third quarter of 2019, according to treasury and financial management firm Kyriba. Companies such as Alphabet  and Apple  have mentioned the strong dollar as a drag on their earnings.
""If we really start to see the dollar gain traction ... that could potentially mean less fuel to sustain the rally we have seen in stocks,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.
Companies in the materials and technology sectors are among the most exposed to currency headwinds, with around 50% of the corporations in both sectors deriving the greater part of their revenues from abroad, an analysis of Russell 1000 companies by Bespoke Investment Group showed.
By contrast, only around 5% of the companies in the real estate and utilities sectors receive the majority of their revenue from overseas, the firm said.
At the same time, the dollar s strength is likely to increase the burden on developing countries, especially those more exposed to the economic effects of China s coronavirus-led slowdown.
Total dollar-denominated debt held by emerging markets stood at $6.4 trillion as of the third quarter, according to the Institute of International Finance. That debt becomes more difficult for countries to service when the dollar rises.

On the other hand, a strong dollar will likely help the eurozone and Japan, as it pushes down their currencies. A weaker currency helps countries  exporters by making their products more competitive abroad and makes it easier for central banks to spur inflation.
But the rising dollar s potentially salutary effects on some foreign economies are unlikely to sit well with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained that other countries are benefiting from a strong dollar at the expense of the United States."

(Reuters) - Developers of self-driving cars are amping up criticism of a California reporting requirement on test data, saying the data could mislead, as the state prepares to release the latest results for 2019.
Companies such as General Motors Co s  Cruise and startup Aurora have said the metric, called disengagements, is not an accurate or relevant way to measure their technical progress, even though it is widely used to do just that.
The debate is taking on more importance amid delays in the rollout of self-driving vehicles and concerns over a lack of regulation and the prospects for profitability for the companies that make such vehicles.
The focus on disengagements -- when a human driver must take manual control from a self-driving system -- and the backlash from self-driving companies have been growing since the California Department of Motor Vehicles began releasing annual disengagement reports five years ago.
California requires all companies testing self-driving vehicles on public roads to submit an annual report on disengagements and what caused them, ""written in plain language.""
In 2018, the companies with the most miles between disengagements were Alphabet Inc s  Waymo and Cruise. Companies with the greatest number of disengagements were Apple Inc  and  Uber Technologies Inc  .
In a February 2019 blog post, Waymo wrote that ""the key to self-driving technology safely improving and scaling is through a robust breadth of experience and scenario testing, represented by a wider array of data points beyond disengagement alone.""
In the same post, Waymo noted its disengagement rate in 2018 dropped 50% from the previous year, while miles between disengagements nearly doubled.
Self-driving companies say the disengagement data can draw unfair comparisons between companies and their self-driving technology.
Aurora co-founder Chris Urmson, who previously headed Waymo s self-driving program, wrote last month that ""these numbers mean little when there s no clear definition of what constitutes a disengagement.""
Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt expressed similar concerns in a blog post last month, adding:"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks sold off on Friday as a spike in new coronavirus cases in China and other countries and as data showing U.S. business activity stalled in February fueled investors  fears about the economy.
Declines on Friday were led by heavyweights  Microsoft Corp  , Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc  for a second straight day.
The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) dropped 2.4%. Chipmakers, with strong ties to China for revenue, also fell sharply, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) falling 3%.
China reported a jump in new cases on Friday, while South Korea became the latest hot spot with 100 new cases and more than 80 people tested positive for the virus in Japan.
""It s creating a wild card,"" for companies and others, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""Going into a weekend not so long after the stock market was hitting highs, people are taking some money off the table.""
The impact could extend beyond the first quarter, he said.
Apple  earlier this week warned on sales due to the impact of the virus outbreak.
The worries pushed up Wall Street s fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index (VIX), and caused investors to seek safe-haven assets.
Gold and bond prices rose, while defensive equity sectors - utilities, real estate and staples - all rose.
The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers  index of services sector activity dropped to its lowest level since October 2013, signalling a contraction for the first time since 2016. The manufacturing sector also clocked its lowest reading since August.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 262.56 points, or 0.9%, to 28,957.42, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 39.79 points, or 1.18%, to 3,333.44 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 189.39 points, or 1.94%, to 9,561.57.
Hopes of monetary easing by major central banks had propelled the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) to all-time highs earlier this week, but the indexes are on course for their first weekly decline in three weeks.
Among other stocks, Dropbox Inc  jumped after it raised its outlook for operating margin, and Deere & Co  rose after an unexpected rise in first-quarter profit.
Sprint Corp  climbed 5.7% as it announced new merger terms with T-Mobile US  that would reduce the stake of major Sprint shareholder SoftBank. T-Mobile shares dipped 0.9%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 54 new lows."

The dollar juggernaut rolls on. The U.S. currency has rocketed to a near three-year high versus the euro (EUR=), a 10-month high against the yen and an 11-year peak versus the Aussie. This month alone it s added 2.5% against six currency peers. 
Economic indicators are reinforcing the U.S growth engine s outperformance. The United States has the highest bond yields among developed nations and its companies keep beating earnings forecasts. It s relative resilience to coronavirus damage makes it today s safe-haven of choice. 
President Donald Trump has been oddly silent on the subject but it s probably a matter of time before he accuses rivals of devaluing their currencies to aid exports. Could the G20 meeting in Riyadh be the forum where Washington starts to chastise? And will it do that in private meetings or opt to name and shame? 
Another question is when dollar strength will make its impact felt on U.S. trade and companies  bottom lines. Corporate America waving red flags may be what finally gives the dollar pause. For now, the 1971 comment by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connelly comes to mind: ""The dollar is our currency, but it is your problem."" It s certainly a problem for the global economy.

2/V OR U?
An apparent slowdown in infection rates had fed hopes the coronavirus outbreak may peak in China. But hold the celebrations. More people are being struck down in other countries, with deaths reported as far away as Iran. South Korea s fourth-largest city, Daegu, has been gripped by fear after dozens caught the virus in what was described as a ""super-spreading event"" at a church.
(Graphic: Coronavirus spread - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2382/2350/virus.png)
Not only is the virus believed to be more contagious than previously thought, but other countries may not be able to replicate Beijing s draconian containment measures. Then there is the fear factor - shops and restaurants are deserted and factories and offices shuttered. The World Bank estimates such outbreaks, and measures to contain them, cost an average of 1% of GDP annually -- this year that adds up to about $870 billion. 
World markets have banked on the virus impact being V-shaped -- a sharp economic decline, then a swift rebound. IMF director Kristalina Georgieva said that scenario was still possible. But depending on how far and fast the virus spreads, the outcome could well be ""like a U curve where the impact is somewhat longer"", she warned.

3/A YEN FOR YOUR THOUGHTS
Japan-watchers have seen this movie before. In 2014, a sinking economy forced a rush of yen out of Japan. And rumor has it that this week s sudden 2-yen drop in the currency past 112 per dollar was caused by Japanese pension funds sending cash overseas, maybe even with the government s blessing. If 2014 is a guideline, the depreciation has long legs. 
Yen weakness is what the doctor would prescribe; the world s third-largest economy is reeling as neighboring China struggles and coronavirus cases at home mount. Recession looks likely as tourism, factories and consumer demand struggle; even the Olympics in July may be at risk. If upcoming industrial output and retail sales data further amplify the fears, it might be a catalyst for the Bank of Japan to abandon its elusive inflation target and prioritize growth.

4/IT S RESULTS THAT MATTER
If you need to be convinced of the U.S. corporate sector s ability to wring out profits even during tough times, just take a look at the S&P500 s fourth-quarter earnings -- estimates from Refinitiv point to growth of 3.1%, defying expectations for a year-over-year decline. In January analysts had forecast a 0.3% fall. 
Of course the figures don t reflect damage from coronavirus. And the tally was lifted by stronger-than-expected results from tech giants including Microsoft  and Apple . 
We also get results in coming days from more consumer-facing companies, including retailer Macy s , whose credit rating was cut to  junk  this week by S&P Global . Results also are due from Marriott International  but that won t reflect the hit it and other hotel chains are taking these days across Asia.
U.S. numbers look all the more impressive when compared with Europe, where a 0.2% profit drop is expected, putting them on track for a year-long earnings recession, according to Refinitiv.

5/FIREFIGHTERS
These are busy days for the International Monetary Fund. Preoccupied with the coronavirus fallout, it is also being asked to resolve the mess in several emerging markets where things have gone sour.
An IMF team will wrap up a three-day visit to Lebanon on Sunday. While the aim is ostensibly to dispense ""technical advice"" on a crippling financial crisis, it may not be long before the fund is asked by Beirut for a formal bailout 
The lender is also fighting fires in Argentina. It ended a week-long visit with a verdict that the country needed a plan to restructure debt. Of course, there are those who say the fund is only sorting out a mess it helped create; Argentine economy minister Martin Guzman claims austerity policies prescribed under the fund s 2018 bailout contributed to the crisis.
Jordan, Egypt, Papua New Guinea and Ukraine are some of the other countries grabbing the fund s attention. As demand for IMF guidance rises, the institution might be reviewing its approach. Fund chief Georgieva has suggested flexible exchange rates -- often the centrepiece of IMF advice to struggling countries -- may not always be the most suitable shock absorber.
Lebanese authorities might be wondering if their country will be the guinea pig for any IMF policy rethink.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. legislation will be introduced in the coming weeks that could hurt technology companies  ability to offer end-to-end encryption, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, and it aims to curb the distribution of child sexual abuse material on such platforms.
The bill, proposed by the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, aims to fight such material on platforms like Facebook  and Alphabet s Google s  by making them liable for state prosecution and civil lawsuits. It does so by threatening a key immunity the companies have under federal law called Section 230.
This law shields certain online platforms from being treated as the publisher or speaker of information they publish, and largely protects them from liability involving content posted by users.
The bill, titled ""The Eliminating Abuse and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act of 2019,"" or the ""EARN IT Act,"" threatens this key immunity unless companies comply with a set of ""best practices,"" which will be determined by a 15-member commission led by the Attorney General.
The move is the latest example of how regulators and lawmakers in Washington are reconsidering the need for incentives that once helped online companies grow, but are increasingly viewed as impediments to curbing online crime, hate speech and extremism.
The sources said the U.S. tech industry fears these ""best practices"" will be used to condemn end-to-end encryption - a technology for privacy and security that scrambles messages so that they can be deciphered only by the sender and intended recipient. Federal law enforcement agencies have complained that such encryption hinders their investigations.
Online platforms are exempted from letting law enforcement access their encrypted networks. The proposed legislation provides a workaround to bypass that, the sources said.
""This a deeply dangerous and flawed piece of legislation that will put every American s security at risk... it is deeply irresponsible to try to undermine security for online communications,"" said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, also known as the Koch network -funded by billionaire Charles Koch. The group sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.
""There is no such thing as a back door just for good guys that does not create a front door for bad guys,"" Blumenthal said. 
On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General William Barr questioned whether Facebook, Google and other major online platforms still need the immunity from legal liability that has prevented them from being sued over material their users post.
During a Senate Judiciary hearing on encryption in December, a bipartisan group of senators warned tech companies that they must design their products  encryption to comply with court orders. Senator Graham issued a warning to Facebook and Apple : ""This time next year, if we haven’t found a way that you can live with, we will impose our will on you.""
A spokeswoman for Senator Graham said ""on timing, other details, we don t have anything more to add right now."" She pointed Reuters to recent comments by the senator saying the legislation is ""not ready"" but ""getting close."" 
A spokeswoman for Senator Blumenthal said he was encouraged by the progress made by the bill. 
A discussion draft of the EARN IT Act has been doing the rounds and has been criticized by technology companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday forcefully defended Berkshire Hathaway Inc s (N:BRKa) decision to invest heavily in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc  as he labors through a four-year drought since his last major acquisition of a company.
Buffett, 89, also used his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders to assure they should not worry about the future of the company, which is ""100% prepared"" for when he and 96-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are no longer around.
Berkshire also posted record full-year earnings of $81.42 billion, nearly twice the prior high from 2017, boosted by unrealized gains from its stock investments. Operating profit, however, fell 3% to $23.97 billion.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate ended the year with a $128 billion cash hoard, after repurchasing $2.2 billion of stock in the fourth quarter and $5 billion in 2019.
""I do think it s on the right path,"" said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh, which invests one-fourth of its assets in Berkshire. ""Its balance sheet is exactly the type of toolkit you d like to leave a successor.""
Berkshire has more than 90 units employing 391,539 people, including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and See s candies; clothing and jewelry companies, and namesake utility and real estate brokerage businesses.
It also invests in such companies as  American Express  Co , Bank of America Corp  and  Coca-Cola Co  .
Berkshire ended the year with a $128 billion cash hoard, having made no major acquisitions since paying $32.1 billion in January 2016 for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, and Buffett lamented his inability to find big companies to buy.
""The opportunities to make major acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare,"" he wrote.
Buffett s letters have grown shorter in recent years, with less humor and less discussion about the economy and investing.
James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who rates Berkshire a ""buy,"" called Saturday s letter a missed opportunity to show how Berkshire, whose stock has trailed the Standard & Poor s 500 (SPX) over the last decade, is undervalued.
""It felt much more businesslike and detached, and lost some of the wisdom that made it so entertaining,"" he said.
AMERICAN TAILWIND REVISITED
The record profit is largely the result of an accounting rule that Buffett urges investors to ignore, requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income.
Buffett, whose $90.2 billion net worth makes him the world s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine, said that while he still prefers buying whole companies, stocks are a better bet than low-yielding bonds.
He attributed that in part to the ""American Tailwind,"" or the economy s ability to grow despite roadblocks such as war, high inflation and financial panic.
""If something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments,"" he wrote.
Buffett s comments surprised Stephen Dodson, who manages the Bretton Fund, which owns Berkshire shares.
""I was expecting him to say the market was expensive,"" Dodson said. ""He didn t even hint that.""
The cash stake has nonetheless been a drag for investors.
In 2019, Berkshire s stock rose 11% while the S&P 500 including dividends rose 31.5%, the biggest shortfall in a decade.
SUCCESSION
Buffett also used his letter to comfort investors that Berkshire will be in good hands after he leaves.
In 2018, Berkshire promoted Greg Abel, 57, and Ajit Jain, 68, to vice chairmen, giving them oversight of Berkshire s non-insurance and insurance operations, respectively, and freeing Buffett and Munger to focus on deploying capital.
Buffett also has portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler helping him buy stocks.
Combs, 49, on Jan. 1 also became Geico s chief executive.
""Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone,"" Buffett wrote. ""That s not exactly great news for us. But Berkshire shareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.""
He also said shareholders will be able to ask Abel and Jain questions at Berkshire s annual meeting on May 2, where Buffett and Munger normally do most of the talking.
""I m comfortable with how Berkshire is moving up the next generation,"" said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a longtime Berkshire shareholder.
Buffett said his estate may need 12 to 15 years to dispose of his Berkshire stock, which is going to charities including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Berkshire stock will be ""a safe and rewarding investment"" during that time."

By Noreen Burke 
Investing.com - While China is slowly getting back to normal, fears over the economic fallout from the spread of coronavirus beyond its borders remain to the fore, so remarks by central bank officials from the U.S. and Europe will be watched for their outlook on the global economy. It’s a quiet week for data with durable goods orders, consumer confidence, and the second reading of fourth quarter growth due out in the U.S. Investors will continue to monitor the U.S. dollar’s progress after it was last week’s big winner in foreign exchange markets (despite Friday’s declines). And while most of earnings season is already in the books, this week will bring results from consumer facing companies. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Finance officials from the world s 20 biggest economies on Saturday called for a coordinated response to the coronavirus outbreak, which the International Monetary Fund predicted would pull down China s growth this year to 5.6% and cut 0.1% from global growth.
“But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,” said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting.
China reported another fall in new cases on Sunday, but world health officials warned it was too early to make predictions about the outbreak as the number of new cases continued to increase in other countries.

Chinese PMI data on Saturday will show the first signs of the outbreak on the world’s second largest economy.


Leaving aside Friday’s declines, triggered by disappointing U.S. PMI data for February, last week saw the greenback rally to a near three-year high versus the euro, a 10-month high against the yen and an 11-year peak versus the Aussie. So far this month it has risen more than 2% against a currency basket.
The U.S. economy’s relative resilience to coronavirus has made the greenback the safe-haven of choice, at least temporarily.
The weak economic outlook in the eurozone and Japan against the background of the coronavirus epidemic is likely to continue to weigh on the euro and the yen.
The selloff in the yen marks a departure from the pattern in recent years where the Japanese currency rises in times of geopolitical or market turmoil due to Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor nation.
“All considered we think the dollar should at least retain its strength, with a chance for more appreciation,” FX analysts at ING said in a note. “At this stage, we suspect that a break above 100 in DXY is just a matter of time.”


Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida is to speak at an economic policy conference in Washington on Tuesday, where other speakers include IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan are also set to make appearances this week, with investors on the lookout for any comments on the virus impact.

Also on Tuesday, a report on U.S. consumer confidence will be closely watched for any indications that the global coronavirus outbreak is hitting sentiment.

Thursday’s durable goods orders data is forecast to be weaker amid a slowdown in factory output in Asia, while the halting of Boeing  737 Max production in mid-January is also likely to weigh. Meanwhile, the second reading of U.S. fourth quarter growth is not expected to be subject to a major revision.


Monday s German IFO report will be central to the direction of the euro this week. The Investing.com consensus is for a reading of 95.3 in the Business Climate Index, down from 95.9 in January. Other key releases will be Friday s inflation numbers for Germany and France which will be closely watched ahead of the upcoming European Central Bank meeting in March.
ECB President Christine Lagarde is due to deliver remarks at an event in Germany on Wednesday, while several other ECB officials, including Chief Economist Philip Lane will also give speeches this week.


Estimates from Refinitiv point to growth of 3.1% in the S&P 500 s fourth-quarter earnings, defying expectations for a year-over-year decline. In January analysts had forecast a 0.3% fall.
Those figures don t reflect damage from coronavirus and earnings growth has been boosted by stronger-than-expected results from tech giants including Microsoft  and Apple .

This week investors will get results from more consumer-facing companies, including retailer Macy’s , whose credit rating was cut to junk last week by S&P Global . Results also are due from Marriott International , but that won t reflect the hit it and other hotel chains are currently taking throughout Asia."

RIYADH (Reuters) - Japanese finance minister Taro Aso criticized on Sunday a U.S. tax reform proposal that he said could undermine global efforts to agree new rules on taxing big tech companies.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) is developing rules to make digital companies pay tax where they do business, rather than where they register subsidiaries - a move that was broadly endorsed by finance leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies on Sunday.
Yet the OECD efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed ""safe harbor"" regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations.
""I told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the  safe harbor  proposal,"" Aso told reporters after attending the G20 gathering.
""It would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we re trying to do. That is a view expressed by various countries,"" he said, joining a chorus of criticism by France and other nations over the U.S. proposal.
Many G20 officials view the United States as reluctant to deal with a potentially tricky political matter before the presidential election later this year.
It is rare for Japan to openly criticize the United States on economic policy, given the two countries  close defense ties.
The taxing of global digital firms such as Amazon , Google  and Apple  - and the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy - have figured prominently at the weekend gathering of G20 finance leaders in Riyadh."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Houston Astros, the Boston Red Sox and Major League Baseball asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a proposed class-action lawsuit by DraftKings participants who said the teams  electronic sign-stealing distorted fantasy baseball contests they wagered on.
In filings with the Manhattan federal court on Friday night, the defendants said courts have repeatedly dismissed legal claims by disgruntled sports fans who said they were harmed by rules violations.
They also said the five plaintiffs knew as early as Sept. 2017 that sign-stealing was occurring, when baseball commissioner Rob Manfred fined the Red Sox for using an Apple  Watch to capture signs from the New York Yankees.
""Plaintiffs got exactly what they bargained for: contests determined by baseball players  actual performance on the field,"" even if rules were broken, lawyers for Major League Baseball wrote, in an argument joined by the Astros and Red Sox.
The defendants also pointed to a 2010 federal appeals court decision rejecting a New York Jets football fan s damages claims over ""Spygate,"" in which the New England Patriots used videotape to steal signals from Jets coaches on the sidelines.
Lawyers for the DraftKings participants on Sunday declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff oversees the case.
The Astros also face lawsuits by season ticket holder Adam Wallach, who said their success from the cheating scandal enabled the team to increase ticket prices, and former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Mike Bolsinger, who said a poor August 2017 outing against the Astros derailed his career.
The Astros went on to win the World Series that year. 
In January, Major League Baseball found that the Astros improperly used technology to decode signs between opposing pitchers and catchers, and relayed the information to batters so they would know what pitches were coming.
Manfred fined the Astros $5 million and suspended general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch.
Both were then fired, as were Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who was a Houston bench coach in 2017, and new New York Mets manager Carlos Beltran, who played for Houston that year.
Manfred has faced criticism for granting immunity to Astros players involved in the scheme.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Saturday posted a 23% decrease in quarterly operating profit, while soaring prices in stock holdings such as Apple Inc  enabled the conglomerate to smash its old record for full-year earnings.
In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett defended Berkshire s foray into stocks, which comes amid a four-year drought since its last major acquisition that has left Berkshire sitting on $128 billion of cash.
Berkshire did step up repurchases of its own stock, buying back roughly $2.2 billion in the quarter. Repurchases totaled $5 billion for the full year.
""I am delighted with the increased commitment to share repurchases,"" said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests $13 billion, of which 13% is in Berkshire. ""It may be a very large arrow in Berkshire s quiver to increase intrinsic value on a per-share basis.""
Nonetheless, while the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units showed improvement, reinsurance operations weighed on operating results, and the Geico car insurer posted ""subpar performance"" as loss claims eclipsed premium growth, according to Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research.
""The big miss was on the insurance front, though energy and railroads were stronger,"" Seifert said. It will be interesting see the impact of coronavirus on freight traffic in the first quarter and beyond.""
Fourth-quarter operating profit fell to $4.42 billion, or approximately $2,720 per Class A share, from $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per share.
Berkshire did not write down its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co , which is struggling to rebound from years of cost-cutting amid changing consumer tastes, though its market value is well below the $13.8 billion carrying cost on Berkshire s balance sheet.
Net income, reflecting stock gains, totaled $29.16 billion, compared with a net loss of $25.39 billion a year earlier.
For all of 2019, net income totaled $81.42 billion, topping the record $44.94 billion for 2017, when Berkshire benefited from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate.
Such huge swings stem from an accounting rule requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income.
Buffett wrote that companies whose stocks Berkshire owns are generating returns that are ""remarkable under any circumstances,"" especially compared with returns on bonds.
Apple soared 86% in 2019 and 31% in the fourth quarter alone, leaving Berkshire with a $73.7 billion year-end stake.

Berkshire s stock was a laggard in 2019, rising 11% compared with a 31.5% gain in the Standard & Poor s 500 including dividends, in part reflecting the drag from the cash stake."

1/ KING DOLLAR
The dollar juggernaut rolls on. The U.S. currency (=USD) has rocketed to a near three-year high versus the euro, a 10-month high against the yen and an 11-year peak versus the Aussie. This month alone it s added 2.5% against six currency peers. Economic indicators are reinforcing the U.S growth engine s outperformance. The United States has the highest bond yields among developed nations and its companies keep beating earnings forecasts. It s relative resilience to coronavirus damage makes it today s safe-haven of choice.
President Donald Trump has been oddly silent on the subject but it s probably a matter of time before he accuses rivals of devaluing their currencies to aid exports.
Another question is when dollar strength will make its impact felt on U.S. trade and companies  bottom lines. Corporate America waving red flags may be what finally gives the dollar pause. For now, the 1971 comment by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connelly comes to mind: ""The dollar is our currency, but it is your problem."" It s certainly a problem for the global economy.

2/ V OR U?
An apparent slowdown in infection rates had fed hopes the coronavirus outbreak may peak in China. But hold the celebrations. More people are being struck down in other countries, with deaths reported as far away as Iran. South Korea reported 231 new cases of a coronavirus, taking total infections to 833 with eight dead as the outbreak centres around its fourth-largest city, Daegu. Italy raced to contain the biggest outbreak of the virus in Europe with three people dead and more than 150 cases reported.
Coronavirus spread: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2382/2350/virus.png
Not only is the virus believed to be more contagious than previously thought, but other countries may not be able to replicate Beijing s draconian containment measures. Then there is the fear factor - shops and restaurants are deserted and factories and offices shuttered. The World Bank estimates such outbreaks, and measures to contain them, cost an average of 1% of GDP annually -- this year that adds up to about $870 billion.
World markets have banked on the virus impact being V-shaped -- a sharp economic decline, then a swift rebound. IMF director Kristalina Georgieva said that scenario was still possible. But depending on how far and fast the virus spreads, the outcome could well be ""like a U curve where the impact is somewhat longer"", she warned.

3/ A YEN FOR YOUR THOUGHTS
Japan-watchers have seen this movie before. In 2014, a sinking economy forced a rush of yen out of Japan. And rumour has it that this week s sudden 2-yen drop in the currency past 112 per dollar was caused by Japanese pension funds sending cash overseas, maybe even with the government s blessing. If 2014 is a guideline, the depreciation has long legs.
Yen weakness is what the doctor would prescribe; the world s third-largest economy is reeling as neighbouring China struggles and coronavirus cases at home mount. Recession looks likely as tourism, factories and consumer demand struggle; even the Olympics in July may be at risk. If upcoming industrial output and retail sales data further amplify the fears, it might be a catalyst for the Bank of Japan to abandon its elusive inflation target and prioritise growth.

4/ IT S RESULTS THAT MATTER
If you need to be convinced of the U.S. corporate sector s ability to wring out profits even during tough times, just take a look at the S&P500 s fourth-quarter earnings -- estimates from Refinitiv point to growth of 3.1%, defying expectations for a year-over-year decline. In January analysts had forecast a 0.3% fall.
Of course the figures don t reflect damage from coronavirus. And the tally was lifted by stronger-than-expected results from tech giants including Microsoft  and Apple .
We also get results in coming days from more consumer-facing companies, including retailer Macy s , whose credit rating was cut to  junk  this week by S&P Global. Results also are due from Marriott International  but that won t reflect the hit it and other hotel chains are taking these days across Asia.
U.S. numbers look all the more impressive when compared with Europe, where a 0.2% profit drop is expected, putting them on track for a year-long earnings recession, according to Refinitiv.

5/ FIREFIGHTERS
These are busy days for the International Monetary Fund. Preoccupied with the coronavirus fallout, it is also being asked to resolve the mess in several emerging markets where things have gone sour.
An IMF team has extended a visit to Lebanon which was meant to wrap up on Sunday. While the aim is ostensibly to dispense ""technical advice"" on a crippling financial crisis, it may not be long before the fund is asked by Beirut for a formal bailout.
The lender is also fighting fires in Argentina. It ended a week-long visit with a verdict that the country needed a plan to restructure debt. Of course, there are those who say the fund is only sorting out a mess it helped create; Argentine economy minister Martin Guzman claims austerity policies prescribed under the fund s 2018 bailout contributed to the crisis.
Jordan, Egypt, Papua New Guinea and Ukraine are some of the other countries grabbing the fund s attention. As demand for IMF guidance rises, the institution might be reviewing its approach. Fund chief Georgieva has suggested flexible exchange rates -- often the centrepiece of IMF advice to struggling countries -- may not always be the most suitable shock absorber.
Lebanese authorities might be wondering if their country will be the guinea pig for any IMF policy rethink.

(Reuters) - Juul Labs Inc is halting sales in Indonesia, citing concerns that it can t stop retailers from selling its high-nicotine e-cigarettes to young people in a largely unregulated tobacco market.
Juul disclosed its Indonesia plans to Reuters as the news organization was inquiring about the company s marketing to younger customers there and in the other two Asian countries where it operates - the Philippines and South Korea. A Reuters review of Juul s Asia marketing found that the firm has promoted e-cigarettes in ways similar to those that raised the ire of regulators in the United States.
Juul said in a statement that it would suspend Indonesia sales ""indefinitely"" until it could ensure that online and traditional retailers there will ""increase and enforce age restrictions and compliance measures.""
The firm s decision to retreat from the world s fourth most populous nation - which has not been previously reported - marks a major setback for Juul s larger plans to expand in Asia. The region has been seen as critical to the company s growth amid mounting U.S. legal and regulatory problems over its role in the nation s youth vaping epidemic.
Juul had launched in Indonesia just seven months ago because it was attracted to the nation s permissive regulatory environment, according to a former employee and another source familiar with its Asia sales strategy. The company had targeted customers aged 19 to 35, according to those two sources and a current Juul employee.
A Juul spokesman said the company only wants adult smokers to use its products.
The Indonesia decision comes after Juul said last month that it was ""reviewing our strategies and operations"" in South Korea - where the company has faced regulatory scrutiny - because of disappointing sales. Juul has also held off on planned expansions in the Netherlands and New Zealand. The company said it is taking a ""methodical approach"" in reviewing its overseas operations on a country-by-country basis.
In Asia, Juul has continued to sell the fruit- and dessert-flavored nicotine ""pods"" that it has voluntarily pulled from U.S. store shelves amid a hail of criticism over their appeal to youth. In Indonesia, Juul has marketed its products in movie theaters and malls frequented by young people, selling its e-cigarettes at kiosks and in sleek, Juul-branded retail shops that mimic Apple  stores. The firm has also hired ""ambassadors"" - often attractive young women - to promote Juul in bars and nightclubs. As recently as last month, Juul was installing kiosks in Jakarta office buildings catering to young tech employees and running advertisements for Juul flavors in office elevators.
Retailers in Indonesia and the Philippines have allowed online sales of Juul devices and pods with no age verification, according to a Reuters review of Juul products advertised for sale on Asian e-commerce platforms. Juul said it did not authorize any sales without verification and has a team that works to remove unauthorized online listings.
Juul did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about its Asia marketing efforts and their appeal to young people. The company said in a statement that it is ""committed to advancing the long-term potential for harm reduction for adult smokers while combating underage use.""
In recent months, the company s stricter approach to marketing in the United States has made it difficult for those in overseas markets such as Indonesia to market in the same way and meet sales targets, the employee said. The company has taken a more cautious approach to international expansion under new CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, the person said, compared to an earlier approach of opening new markets as fast as possible.
The company is exploring expansions in Vietnam and Japan later this year, the employee said. A Juul spokesman confirmed the company is monitoring the regulatory environment in Vietnam but said it currently has no plans to launch there. The spokesman declined to comment on Japan.
A LOSING BET ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
International expansion has been seen as crucial to Juul s future as the company s U.S. problems have caused investors to slash growth forecasts. Marlboro maker  Altria Group   Inc - which bought a 35% stake in Juul Labs Inc in December 2018 for $12.8 billion - has since marked down its value by a total of $8.6 billion.
Altria executives were initially bullish on Juul s international prospects. In an earnings call soon after the Juul deal, Altria CEO Howard Willard said he expected Juul s international revenue and profits to eventually be ""as large as or larger than the U.S. opportunity.""
Those prospects have dimmed, however, as some overseas regulators took note of the widespread criticism of Juul in the United States. India banned e-cigarettes last fall, citing the U.S. epidemic of youth use, and countries such as Malaysia are considering similar restrictions.
But Indonesia - until now - had been seen as one of the company s biggest opportunities. The country of nearly 270 million people has among the world s highest smoking rates and weakest regulations, imposing no penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.
In an interview with Reuters in July, when Juul launched in Indonesia, the company s executive running the Asia Pacific region, Ken Bishop, acknowledged that attracting young adult smokers was important to its success there.
""That is typically where we see the initial interest,"" he said, adding that eventually the product would appeal to ""any demographic"" including longtime smokers.
Bishop also emphasized the importance of preventing sales to teenagers.
MARKETING AT MOVIES, DANCE CLUBS
Just before a November screening of the movie Charlie s Angels in downtown Jakarta, Indonesia, teenagers who filled the theater watched one ad for an e-commerce site that featured Korean boy band BTS, another for spicy instant noodles, and a third for Juul e-cigarettes.
""Odor-free, tar-free, mess-free,"" the voiceover said as colorful displays of mint and mango flavors for the ""#1 Vaporizer in America"" flashed across the screen.
Juul said that Charlie s Angels was a 17-and-up film in Indonesia and that it has stopped cinema advertising in the last two months. Juul did not answer questions on what age group it aimed to reach with the movie ads or why it stopped them.
Juul hired its 150 ""brand ambassadors"" through a marketing firm to promote its products in night clubs, restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores, according to the three people familiar with its Asia marketing strategy. Through a contract with Indonesian marketing firm Nava Plus, the ambassadors charged 2000 rupiah (the equivalent of $0.15 in U.S. dollars) for sample hits on a Juul at places such as the swanky Omnia Bali nightclub. Nava Plus did not respond to requests for comment.
Such efforts reflected the goal of reaching customers in their 20s and early 30s by pitching the device as a trendy lifestyle product, according to the three sources. The campaign mirrors early U.S. promotions at music festivals and other events catering to young people, which have since become a focus of government investigations into Juul s marketing.
Juul has denied it ever targeted teenagers in any country, but the company has acknowledged that those early U.S. campaigns focused on young adults aged 25 to 34 - a strategy company executives later called a mistake.
Instagram posts last August promoting Juul s largest Asia store in Town Square  Cilandak, a Jakarta mall, evoked a club scene, with dance music playing in the background of a promotional video with the staff, and slogans reading ""come now and feel the experience."" Juul said the Instagram post was developed by the mall, not the company, without explaining how Juul store employees were featured without its consent. The company said it requested that the post be taken down after Reuters inquired about it.
The Town Square store is located across from an ice cream shop. Near another Juul store, in the upscale Plaza Indonesia, a miniature train takes children through the mall. 
Juul has also launched its own branded stores and kiosks in Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines, which have a sleek, modern vibe. Buyers can engrave their names for free on Juul devices, and the shops are staffed by vendors who are typically in their 20s, wearing black-and-white uniforms embroidered with the Juul logo. They almost invariably serve customers about the same age, three clerks at Juul stores in popular Jakarta malls told Reuters.
The flavors Juul stopped selling in the United States amid criticism remain a hit among young Juulers in Asia. Sungwon Cho, a 26-year old photographer in Seoul, started using Juul in April because it was more convenient than traditional cigarettes and ""didn t smell bad.""

""I like the sweet taste,"" he said. ""It feels like I am vaping a candy or jelly."""

Investing.com - Wall Street plunged into the red in early trading Monday as a spike in the number of Covid-19 virus cases confirmed outside of China pushed money out of riskier investments.
The Dow dove 905.27 points, or 3.12%, to 28,087.04 at 9:35 AM ET (14:35 GMT) and the S&P 500 fell 93.63, or 2.8%, to 3,245.62. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 341.72, or 3.6%, 9,234.87, with tech stocks particularly hard hit.
The U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted the most since October and the 10-Year yield fell below 1.37%. Its all-time low is 1.32% hit in 2016 after the Brexit vote.
Worries snowballed over the weekend as the numbers of cases of Covid-19 jumped in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Authorities in Italy imposed a quarantine in the north of the country and its benchmark MIB index tumbled nearly 6%.
The Covid-19 shock is a test of the fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) and buy-the-dip conditioning that has helped stocks overcome the headwinds of valuations, Allianz  Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.
“A key element is whether markets distinguish between Central Banks  willingness (high) and ability (low) to counter the economic shock,” he said.
Among individual stocks, Dow component Apple  sank 6% after the latest data showed shipments of mobile phones in China dove 36.6% in January from the year-ago period.
High-flying Tesla , which has a factory in Shanghai, was also hit on virus worries, with shares dropping 8.6%.
Chip stocks were also hard hit. Advanced Micro Devices  lost 10.2%, Nvidia  tumbled 8.4% and Micron Technology  slumped 7.4%.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), on Monday called the coronavirus outbreak ""scary stuff"" but said that it was no time to sell stocks despite the threat of a pandemic.
Speaking on CNBC, Buffett said investors with a 10- to 20-year time horizon and focused on companies  earnings power will fare well in stocks, and that the outbreak has ""not changed"" his long-term outlook.
""It is scary stuff,"" Buffett said. ""I don t think it should affect what you do in stocks.""
Markets worldwide fell on Monday on concern about how the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, which began in China and has spread to countries including Italy, South Korea and Iran, could disrupt supply chains and slow global economic growth.
Buffett, however, said long-term investors should not get caught up in daily headlines, and that Berkshire would ""certainly be more inclined"" to buy stocks than on Friday.
""If you look at the present situation,"" he said, ""you get more for your money in stocks than bonds.""
He said this was true though the U.S. economy, while sill strong, had become ""a little softer"" than it was six months ago.
The economy grew 2.3% last year but has experienced slower consumer spending and industrial production.
Buffett spoke two days after Berkshire said operating profit fell 3% in 2019 to $23.97 billion, hurt by losses from insurance underwriting, while unrealized gains in Apple Inc  and other investments boosted net income to a record $81.42 billion.
Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has more than 90 operating businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer and Dairy Queen ice cream, and Buffett said the coronavirus outbreak has affected a significant number.
Many of the roughly 1,000 Dairy Queens in China are closed, while those that are open ""aren t doing any business to speak of,"" Buffett said, while Johns Manville insulation and Shaw carpeting have seen supply chain disruptions.
""There s always trouble coming,"" he said. ""The real question is where are those businesses going to be in five or 10 years.""
Berkshire s stock price has trailed the Standard & Poor s 500 (SPX) over the last decade, and Buffett said it will not trounce the broader market as it once did, in part reflecting its size and roughly $558 billion market value.
Buffett said Berkshire over the long term is unlikely to be in the top 15% or bottom 30% of stocks, but will outperform in down markets.

Any long-term outperformance ""will be minor, but it will be done in a very very safe manner,"" he said."

By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Apple shares  slumped Monday, adding to the big weakness in Wall Street’s major indices, but the megacap managed to recover some from its big plunge at the open.

Apple lost 4.5% in morning trading, but had been down about 6% when the bell rang.
That accounted for more than 95 points off the Dow, which was down a whopping 856.

Apart from the overall fear that Covid-19 could turn into a pandemic and slam global economic growth, Apple were hit by tangible demand destruction in China, where the virus originated.
Weak mobile phone number out before the bell prompted selling.
Mobile phone brands shipped a total of 20.4 million devices that month, down 36.6% from 32.1 million in January 2019, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed.
China’s smartphone market has been shrinking for a number of years as demand became more reliant on consumers replacing existing handsets than buying new ones. However, January’s drop was far larger than was seen in the same month last year, when sales fell 11.4%.
After trading began, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Apple’s appeal against a verdict to by $440 million in damages for internet security patents held by patent licensing company VirnetX.

The justices rejected Apple s appeal in the long-running case in which a federal jury in 2016 found that Apple had infringed VirnetX s patents and awarded $302 million. A judge later increased that amount to $439.7 million including interest and other costs."

Italy, South Korea and Iran reported sharp rises in coronavirus cases on Monday as the virus  reach continued to spread. The World Health Organization said on Monday that the virus has pandemic potential, although it was premature to declare that level of severity yet.
U.S. stocks slid more than 3% while Treasury yields tumbled and the yield curve inversion deepened - a sign that signals potential recession.

If the virus is eventually labeled as a pandemic it would sweep fear into consumers and could impact spending, said Andrew Richman, managing director of fixed income strategies at SunTrust Advisory Services in Jupiter, Florida. 
That could add another dimension to the economic damage that the virus has already wrought. 
“From the perspective of the consumer, I think it would change things,"" said Richman. ""I think you would see another fear-induced leg down in the equities market.”
Already, companies such as iPhone giant Apple Inc  have warned that supply chain disruptions could lead to short-term product delays. Any further spread of the virus will likely exacerbate those problems and hurt demand, said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital. 
""The market has been too complacent with how it was pricing in those risks,"" he said. ""We expect to see extended impacts on the supply chain that could slow economic growth overall."" 
DOWNSIDE RISK 
Analysts cautioned that a dip in the yield of benchmark 10-year Treasuries - yields move inversely to prices - below its record low of 1.32% touched in 2016 would likely exacerbate the stock market sell-off. 
""This isn t just an issue of economic fundamentals, there is a lot of fear in the market now,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. ""A break in new lows for Treasury yields would brings up a whole new host of fears of what does the bond market know that the stock market doesn t.""
A continued sell-off in equities while the bond market continues to rally would also put an end to a synchronicated rally that had pushed both risk-on assets like U.S. stocks and typical safe-havens like the dollar and Treasuries all up by 3% or more this year.
“Especially in the bond market the fear of this becoming more pandemic in nature has really spread,” said Charlie Ripley, Senior Investment Strategist for Allianz  Investment Management. ""As volatility in the equity market has started to pick up it’s possible that we are seeing a divergence from what we were seeing over the previous four weeks” when both equities and bonds rallied, he said.

Jeff Grills, head of emerging markets debt at Aegon Asset Management, cautioned that further stimulus measures by global central banks may not ease concerns about the impact of the virus on the supply chain. 
""Pumping liquidity into the system does a lot to support financial markets but doesn’t encourage people to leave their houses and go to work or spend money,"" Grills said.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The Dow and S&P suffered their biggest daily loss in two years on Monday, paced by a selloff in energy and tech stocks on worries about a potential coronavirus pandemic outbreak.

The S&P 500 tumbled 3.35%, Nasdaq Composite lost 3.71% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.56%, or 1,032 points.

The World Health Organization warned that a ""sudden increase in new cases"" outside of China is ""deeply concerning,"" following a rise in infections of Covid-19 in Italy, South Korea and Iran.
Italy reported more than 220 cases of the virus, with five deaths as of Monday morning. South Korea confirmed 231 cases, taking the total in the country to more than 830. Iran, meanwhile, confirmed 61 total cases, with 12 deaths nationwide.

With fears rising that the window of opportunity to contain the virus may have been missed and of a longer-than-expected return to normal operations for supply chains in China, investors abandoned tech and travel stocks.
Facebook , Apple , Amazon , Netflix  and Google-parent Alphabet  were down sharply.

Semiconductor companies, for which China represents an important source of growth, led the broader decline in the tech, with Advanced Micro Devices  and Nvidia  both down 7% and Texas Instruments  down 5%.

The flight-to-safety trade triggered buying in U.S. government bonds, sending prices higher and yields lower, causing a decline in bank stocks.

JPMorgan  fell 2.7%, Bank of America  slid 4.7% and Goldman Sachs  lost 2.7% as a fall in bond yields tends to weigh on net interest margin.

The spread of the virus, however, has prompted investor hopes the Federal Reserve will come to the rescue and deliver a rate cut sooner rather than later.
""The U.S. economy will also likely be affected, but based on the current backdrop, recession risk still appears relatively low. The drag will be partially offset by a sharp drop in interest rates and energy prices,"" Suntrust said in a note to clients.  
But Fed members appear unwilling, for the moment at least, to sway from the central bank s ongoing narrative that monetary policy remains appropriate.

“In my view, our current policy stance is appropriate given the outlook of growth near its trend pace, solid labor market conditions, and inflation rates not far” from the Fed’s 2% goal, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said.

New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday suffered their biggest one-day percentage losses in two years after a surge in coronavirus cases outside China fanned worries about the global economic impact of a potential pandemic.
Investors sold riskier assets and rushed to traditionally safer bets such as gold and U.S. Treasuries after countries including Iran, Italy and South Korea reported a rise in virus cases over the weekend even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities. 
The benchmark S&P 500, which represents over 44% of the market capitalization of all global equities, lost $927 billion of its value on Monday alone and $1.33 trillion since its closing high on Wednesday last week, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt. 
The S&P and the blue-chip Dow turned negative for the year to date and the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points on the day for only the third time in its history. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.71%, the biggest daily percentage drop of the three major averages.
""We re not likely to make any progress higher until we have evidence the spread of the coronavirus is decelerating,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,031.61 points, or 3.56%, to 27,960.8, the S&P 500 lost 111.86 points, or 3.35%, to 3,225.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 355.31 points, or 3.71%, to 9,221.28.All of the 11 major S&P sectors closed in the red, led by the energy sector s 4.7% decline and followed by a 4.2% drop in technology stocks. 
Apple Inc  slid 4.8% as data showed sales of smartphones in China tumbled by more than a third in January.
China-exposed chipmakers fell, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index dropping 4.8%, while concerns about growing travel curbs dragged the NYSE Arca Airline Index down 6%.
Of the S&P s sectors, the defensive utilities, real estate and consumer staples indexes fell the least on the day. 
Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels since 2016 as investors sought safety in government bonds, while the yield curve inversion between the 3-month and 10-year U.S. Treasuries deepened in what is often viewed as a recession predictor. 
Adding to worries, Goldman Sachs  slashed its U.S. growth forecast on Sunday and predicted a more severe impact from the epidemic. [US/]
The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, registered its biggest one-day jump since February 2018 and ended the day at 25.03, its highest closing level since January 2019. 
""There was this underlying concern that was out there, and obviously over the weekend, it just escalated,"" said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia.
After Monday s nosedive, the S&P closed almost 5% below its record closing high, achieved last week, while the Nasdaq ended 6% off its peak close and the Dow ended the day 5.4% below its record close.

The S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average and the Dow slipped below its 100-day moving average, all closely watched technical indicators.
Health insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc  and  Cigna Corp   dropped almost 8% after Senator Bernie Sanders, who backs the elimination of private health insurance, strengthened his position for the Democratic presidential nomination with a victory in the Nevada caucuses.
Janney Montgomery Scott s Luschini said that while the coronavirus was ""by far and away the primary influence"" for the market s decline on Monday, investors, he said, were ""also beginning to handicap the odds of Sanders being the Democratic nominee.""
In a rare bright spot,  Gilead Sciences Inc  , whose antiviral remdesivir has shown promise in monkeys infected by a related coronavirus, rose 4.6%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 6.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 23 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 154 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges, 10.59 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 7.79 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The S&P 500 suffered its worst day in two years on Monday as a surge in coronavirus cases outside China rattled investors already worried about valuations following recent record highs.
The S&P 500 s 3.35% slump was the leading U.S. stock index s deepest one-day loss since February 2018, when Wall Street was in a correction.
The fear in Monday s session came after investors in recent months often downplayed the overall risk related to the new coronavirus. Monday s drop wiped out all of the S&P 500 s gains for 2020.
""With stock prices and valuations still near cycle highs, the risk of a worsening virus outbreak has not been priced into the market to a great extent,"" Truist/SunTrust Advisory Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner wrote in a client note.
S&P 500 sector indexes are mostly still close to their record highs, with the exception of energy (SPNY). The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT) tumbled 4.2% on Monday, slammed by losses for chipmakers and Apple , which rely more than most other U.S. companies on China. The information technology index is down over 7% from its record high on Feb 19, but remains up almost 4% in 2020.

Increased fears that the coronavirus could become a pandemic led to a spike in the number of listings on the New York Stock Exchange hitting 52-week lows. At 503, Monday saw the greatest number of new lows in a session since last August. At the same time, the number of stocks hitting 52-week highs shrank to 278 from over 400 on Friday."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board will hold a public hearing on Tuesday to establish the probable cause of a fatal March 2018 Tesla  Autopilot crash in California and will issue a series of safety recommendations, two people briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The safety board is expected to issue recommendations to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla and a California transportation agency, the sources said.
The NTSB issued recommendations after other Tesla Autopilot crashes and planned to reiterate some of the guidance. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The NTSB and NHTSA did not comment ahead of the 1 p.m. meeting.
There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.
Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using the driver assistance system Autopilot, but the company advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention.
The NTSB, which criticized Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, also found in September the system’s design permitted a ""driver to disengage from the driving task"" in a January 2018 California crash.
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple  software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Mountain View, California, in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier known as a ""crash attenuator.""
In September, the NTSB said California should ensure timely repairs of highway traffic safety equipment. California had failed to repair the attenuator after a crash 11 days before the one involving Huang. The attenuator is designed to absorb crash forces before a vehicle hits a concrete median barrier.
Caltrans spokesman Matt Rocco said on Monday the agency ""is implementing several steps to enhance monitoring and tracking of the repair of damage to highway infrastructure."" The efforts include ""enhanced reporting on the timely repair of high priority traffic safety devices.""
The NTSB said earlier that Huang’s hands were not detected on the steering wheel in the final six seconds before the fatal crash. There was no evidence of braking or evasive action. Huang also reported that on prior trips, the car steered away from the highway requiring his intervention, the NTSB said.
The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and logs recovered show a word-building game was active during Huang’s fatal trip."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear Apple  Inc s bid to avoid paying about $440 million in damages for using patent licensing firm VirnetX Inc s internet security technology without permission in features such as FaceTime video calling.
The justices rejected Apple s appeal in the long-running case in which a federal jury in 2016 found that Apple had infringed VirnetX s patents and awarded $302 million. A judge later increased that amount to $439.7 million including interest and other costs.
The case dates back to 2010 when Nevada-based VirnetX filed suit in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas accusing Cupertino, California-based Apple of infringing four patents for secure networks, known as virtual private networks, and secure communications links. VirnetX said Apple infringed with its FaceTime and VPN on Demand features in products such as the iPhone and iPad.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in patent disputes, upheld the judgment against Apple last year. 
During the litigation, Apple and other companies requested that a tribunal of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review the validity of the VirnetX patents. The tribunal canceled key parts of the patents at issue in the case. 
But in separate decisions also issued last year, the Federal Circuit set aside certain of the tribunal s rulings, bringing VirnetX closer to collecting damages from Apple. Apple appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the damages should be recalculated because the specific patents VirnetX accused it of infringing with FaceTime were nearly wiped out. 
Apple in a court filing called the Federal Circuit s refusal to entertain its demands ""legally wrong and grossly unfair."" The company also said the lower courts impermissibly allowed VirnetX to request damages far beyond the value of the patented invention. 

VirnetX told the justices: ""The entire damages award ... remains supported by claims that a jury - and the Federal Circuit - found valid years ago and that have not been canceled since."""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian share markets found some stability on Tuesday after a wave of early selling petered out and Wall Street futures managed a solid bounce, allowing investors to take a breather from coronavirus fears.
Some dealers cited a Wall Street Journal report on a possible vaccine as helping sentiment, though human tests of the drug are not due until the end of April and results not until July or August.
Whatever the cause, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) bounced 0.7% to pare some of the steep 3.35% loss the cash index (SPX) suffered overnight. EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) also added 0.6%, and FTSE futures (FFIc1) nudged up 0.3%.
South Korea s hard-hit market (KS11) eked out a 0.6% rise and helped MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fight back to flat.
Japan s Nikkei (N225) was still down 3.4%, catching up to the global sell-off having been shut on Monday, while Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) eased 1.6%.
European and U.S. stocks had suffered their biggest loses since mid-2016 amid fears the coronavirus was morphing into a pandemic that could cripple global supply chains and wreak far greater economic damage than first thought.
The risks were such that bond markets were wagering central banks would have to ride to the rescue with new stimulus.
Futures for the Federal Reserve funds rate  have surged in the last few days to price in a 50-50 chance of a quarter-point rate cut as early as April. In all, they imply more than 50 basis points of reductions by year end.
Central banks across Asia have already been easing policy, while governments have promised large injections of fiscal stimulus, something western countries might also have to consider.
The Dow (DJI) had ended Monday down 3.55%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.35% and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 3.71%. Wall Street s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), jumped to its highest close since early 2019.
Underlining the economic impact of the virus was a 3.5% drop in Apple Inc  as data showed sales of smartphones in China tumbled by more than a third in January.
BONDS BET ON RATE CUTS
The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, feeding worries it could turn into a pandemic.
""If travel restrictions and supply chain disruptions spread, the impact on global growth could be more widespread and longer lasting,"" said Jonas Glotermann at Capital Economics.
""While we still think that it would take a significant deterioration in the outlook for the U.S. economy for policymakers to cut rates, they may feel compelled to do so if the virus spreads and leads to continued falls in the stock market and inversion of the Treasury yield curve.""
The rush to bonds left yields on 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) at 1.39%, down almost 20 basis points in just three sessions and paying less than overnight rates. Yields were now rapidly approaching the all-time low of 1.321% hit in July 2016.
The sharp drop, combined with the simple fact the Fed had far more room to cut rates than its peers, kept the U.S. dollar restrained after a run of strong gains.
The euro edged up a little from recent three-year lows to reach $1.0862 (EUR=), while the dollar was back at 110.83 yen  and away from a 10-month top of 112.21. [USD/]

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As many parts of China ease coronavirus travel curbs, main manufacturing hubs in the east and south are seeing hundreds of thousands of migrant workers returning to work and more traffic on the roads during rush hours.
Mainland China reported nine new coronavirus cases outside the epicenter of Hubei on Monday, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.
Several provinces have lowered their coronavirus emergency response measures, allowing more flexibility on transportation and helping firms resume production.
About 180 million workers have left their hometowns to return to work since Feb 10, when China ended the prolonged Lunar New Year holiday due to the virus outbreak, according to Reuters calculations based on transportation ministry data.
At the current daily travel flow rate of more than 14 million people, about 192 million people are likely to return to cities where they work during the last two weeks in February, beating a government projection of 120 million.
(Graphic: China s post-Lunar New Year holiday travel flows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8693/8674/transportation%20ministry.jpg)
Data compiled by China s internet giant Baidu Inc  shows that Guangdong province, an economic and export powerhouse in the south, and Zhejiang province, a major manufacturing hub for textile and machines in the east, are seeing significantly more inflows of migrant workers since last week.
(Graphic: Migrant flows into China s Guangdong province - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8694/8675/Guangdong.jpg)
Guangdong government said it has sent nearly 200 chartered trains in the past two weeks to bring more than 6,000 migrant workers back from their inland hometowns.
""Guangdong is prioritizing production resumption at information technology, automobile, petrochemicals and household appliances firms... especially Huawei, ZTE (SZ:000063), Midea (SZ:000333) and GAC Group,"" said a senior Guangdong official at a press briefing on Saturday.
Shenzhen, headquarters of Huawei and known as China s Silicon Valley, has seen migrant flows picking up to the highest level after the Lunar New Year holiday, although it is still well below travel flows during peak days last year.
(Graphic: Migrant flows into China s tech hub Shenzhen city - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8695/8676/Shenzhen.jpg)
Urban transport in Shenzhen also shows a sharp rise this week. According to Shenzhen traffic police data, 420,900 cars were tracked on roads during morning peak hours on Monday, up 58% compared to the same period last week.
That remains 40% less traffic than a normal Monday before the coronavirus outbreak, as Chinese authorities are still encouraging employees to work remotely to reduce the risk of virus spread.
Location technology firm TOMTOM s traffic index also shows a climb in congestion levels in Shenzhen and other major cities, including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai, this week.

Guangdong province added 30,000 firms to its business resumption list last week, compared to only 12,000 firms the week before.
Even as companies return to work, production levels remain behind what they would normally be due to supply chain disruptions, curbed demand, and spotty labor shortages.
Foxconn, one of the most important contract manufacturers for Apple Inc   has yet to resume production at full capacity. The iPhone maker recently lowered its revenue guidance for the quarter due to sourcing and production issues in China.
China Southern  Power Grid [CNPOW.UL], power supplier of Guangdong, said the province consumed 5.58 bln kilowatt-hours electricity in the week of Feb.16, up 17.3% from the week of Feb.9. Power consumption at industrial firms rose 62.1% on the week, and rose 15% at information technology firms.
The grid has not yet revealed the power data for the week of Feb. 23.
Daily coal consumption at six major coal-fired power groups across China rose to 427,000 tonnes on Monday, the highest level for nearly a month, but still 34% lower than the same period last year."

OSLO (Reuters) - Eight candidates have applied to head Norway s sovereign wealth fund, the country s central bank said on Tuesday, as its board prepares to decide who should steer the global portfolio of assets worth $1.1 trillion through a time of transition.
The bank s all-male list of candidates identified seven applicants, including the fund s deputy chief executive, 49-year-old Trond Grande.
The deadline for applications was Friday, and one name was kept confidential, as permitted in exceptional circumstances such as when publicity could harm a current employer.
The successor to Yngve Slyngstad, who is stepping down as CEO after a dozen years, will take over the fund as its regulators grapple with strategic changes, such as how to respond to climate risk and a proposed $100 billion increase in investments in the United States.
The world s largest sovereign wealth fund, it manages revenues from Norway s oil and gas industry for future generations, holds stakes in more than 9,000 companies, owning 1.4% of all listed stocks globally. It also invests in bonds and real estate.
From modest beginnings in 1996, it is now worth three times more than Norway s annual gross domestic product, making its investment returns a vital source of government funding.
It has at times met political resistance, including over moves to diversify away from oil. Parliament severely diluted its 2017 proposal to divest all oil and gas stocks.
Grande, the deputy CEO, spent 11 years at Norwegian asset manager  Storebrand   before joining the fund in 2007, and has since held a variety of posts, including as head of real estate holdings and head of risk management.
The fund did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Grande, who stood out as the best-known of the candidates that were named. Slyngstad s successor is expected to take charge within the next few months."

LONDON (Reuters) - Will China s coronavirus outbreak send the world economy into recession?
As cases spread across Asia and in Europe, only some of the multiple indicators investors use to monitor recession signals are flashing red, implying the frail global economy may not necessarily be heading towards a contraction.
It is too early to be sure, however. The outbreak is still continuing to spread and key data points for February are still unavailable.
What s more, forecasting global recessions is tricky because most countries can t match U.S. data for its breadth. It s also rare for the world economy to actually shrink - prior to 2008-2009, that happened only in 1990-1991.
But taking into account population growth and poor countries  need for faster expansion rates, the broad rule of thumb is that world growth below 2% can be classed as recession.
The International Monetary Fund still expects 3.3% global growth in 2020. But it cut China forecasts to 5.6% and voiced fears the coronavirus impact could be longer-lasting than previously expected.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed the country s 6% growth target will be met.
But Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), said there was a 90% probability Chinese growth would fall below 5% if the virus continued to disrupt economic activity.
""That would be the tipping point. The question then will be if world growth will fall under 2%,"" he added.
Here are 10 charts of frequently used recession indicators.
1/U.S. LEADS THE WORLD
If the world s biggest economy tips into recession, it s likely others will follow. But a closely watched Leading Economic Index in the United States, compiled by the Conference Board think-tank, hit a record high in January.
The index suggests ""the current economic expansion – at about 2% – will continue through early 2020,"" the Conference Board said.
But the index also leans heavily on indicators tied to manufacturing, which now accounts for less than a fifth of U.S. economic activity. The surge also reflected the run-up in stock prices last month.

2/CURVEBALL
An inverted yield curve, when short-dated borrowing costs rise above longer yields, has been a reliable gauge of U.S. downturns, having predicted almost every recession in the past half-century.
Now, the coronavirus has sent three-month borrowing costs above 10-year rates while the two-year/10-year curve is less than 20 basis points from inversion.
""The Treasury market is pricing that the world economy is going to be flirting with sub-2% growth,"" LGIM s Onuekwusi said.

3/CHINA MOMENTUM INDICATOR
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reportedly favors three indicators to monitor growth - freight volumes, power consumption and bank loans - unified in Fathom Consulting s China Momentum Index.
The index tumbled in 2008 before the global crisis and fell below 2 in 2015-16 amid Chinese ""hard landing"" fears.
The index stood at 5.1 in December, off three-years lows touched in mid-2019 during the Sino-U.S. trade spat. But recovery has probably fizzled this year as the virus dampened activity.

If growth hinges on booming trade, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) shipping benchmark is sounding alarm bells. It hit three-year lows this month and has dipped during every previous recession. Since September the BDI has plunged 80% to around 506 points. It troughed during the 2016 growth scare at around 300 points.

5/WHAT DO PURCHASING MANAGERS THINK?
Purchasing Managers  Indexes have been reliable in predicting manufacturing and services trends so February s drop in the U.S. services PMI to the lowest since October 2013 was a shock.
Signaling that a sector accounting for two-thirds of the world s biggest economy was in contraction, the ""flash"" PMI ""brought home how close we might be to recession because of the coronavirus,"" London and Capital Group told clients.
Global composite global PMIs from JPMorgan  showed output and new orders still expanding last month. But February s composite is likely to be very different.

6/INFLATION AND BONDS
Bond yields and inflation usually rise when growth is strong and vice-versa. So the recent tumble in market-based inflation gauges - five-year forward swaps - in the euro zone and the United States is cause for concern.
And 7-10 year yields on the Bloomberg/Barclays Multiverse, a global debt benchmark, are at six-month lows and approaching the lows hit during the 2016 growth scare.

7/ASK DR COPPER
Copper s record as a boom-bust indicator has earned it the ""Dr. Copper"" moniker. And because gold is considered a store of value during recession, the gold/copper ratio can point where growth is heading. So if the economy s tanking, dump copper and buy gold.
The current ratio - approaching 2009 peaks - is worrying. But in the modern economy copper s predictive power has weakened. Also during market panic, ""sentiment tends to boost gold and weigh on copper. That can open the spread and lead to a false signal,"" said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.

8/DEMAND FOR DEFENSIVES
There are shares that do well when the economy is robust and others which perform in tough times. The former category comprises  cyclicals  - carmakers and retailers for instance - while  defensives  include utilities and consumer staples.
But these days the cyclicals vs defensives ratio is skewed by tech - nominally classed as cyclicals, companies such as Apple  and Amazon  have behaved increasingly like safe defensives.

Financial conditions indices (FCI), comprising elements such as long-term borrowing costs, exchange rates and equity moves, show how supportive the backdrop is for growth. Tighter conditions are generally a negative.
A Goldman Sachs  index https://tmsnrt.rs/32lFIqw shows conditions have eased since early January, possibly as China loosens policy. But the index does not yet reflect this week s massive equity selloff.

South Korean trade figures are the first to emerge each month from any major economy and therefore receive close scrutiny. The picture isn t pretty - exports contracted in January for the 14th straight month.
February data is now awaited, especially on semiconductors - used in electronics and comprising a fifth of South Korean exports, overseas sales have fallen for five months straight.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson  said on Tuesday it would partner with Apple Inc  on a study to use an iPhone app and the Apple Watch to study how earlier detection of atrial fibrillation impacts stroke in people aged 65 or older.
Last year, Apple s Heart Study https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-watch-heart/apple-watch-detects-irregular-heartbeats-in-u-s-study-idUSKBN1XN2S2 found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association. 
Jeff Williams , Apple s chief operating officer, said the initial study proved the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation with a low rate of false alarms, which helped Apple gain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a watch app that takes an electrocardiogram, or EKG, measurement. The study with J&J aims to show if early detection leads to better health outcomes.
""We want to follow the science all the way to the end, no matter what the outcomes are, and run this longitudinal study,"" Williams told Reuters in an interview. ""It s not something that we have to do, but it s the right thing to do."" 
The joint effort, called ""Heartline,"" is significant because J&J is one of the world s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies. 
""What we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,"" said Paul Stoffels, J&J s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years.
The study could also reach a different population than Apple s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation.
J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65.
""What we re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?"" Burton said.
The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an EKG. 
If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study.
The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches.
The study will pay participants, who must agree to share their Medicare claims data. Apple and J&J officials said that was key to proving whether the use of the app and watch lead to reduced stroke risk.

""With tens of millions of watches on people s wrists and us delivering this early detection, we have a huge responsibility to make sure that early detection is effective and really helping people with their health in the long haul,"" Apple s Williams told Reuters."

(Reuters) - Technology shares -- a key engine of the stock market s climb to records over the last several months -- are now among those leading Wall Street s plunge on growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 information technology sector has fallen 9.3% since Thursday’s close, outpacing a drop of 7.3% for the broader index. Only energy has performed worse, reflecting a sharp decline in oil prices on fears that the coronavirus will slow global economic activity.
Investors poured billions into big technology stocks and other momentum bets last year, as a dovish Federal Reserve stoked risk appetite and fueled a rally of more than 30% in the S&P 500. Some big technology and momentum stocks kept griding higher, driving markets to records even as concerns grew over the virus’ spread in China in recent weeks.
Now a surge in coronavirus cases outside of China has made some investors more willing to part with riskier assets in favor of traditional havens like gold and U.S. Treasuries, which have soared in recent days.
“Everyone just got a full helping of tech stocks up at the high. It was some of the most reckless buying I’ve seen in my lifetime,” said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners.
(GRAPHIC: Roller coaster 2020 for market s big names - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R8D7C1H/eikon.png)
Stanton rode shares of Amazon  and other big technology names higher last year. He now owns derivatives will rise if the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index continues to decline.
As of Friday, the S&P 500 information technology sector accounted for nearly 55% of the overall S&P 500 s total return in 2020, even though the sector was only 24.3% of the benchmark index s market value, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Just four companies -- Microsoft , Apple , Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet  -- accounted for 46.4% of the 2020 total return as of Friday, Silverblatt said.
That magnitude of concentration in a small universe of names had some investors worried that they have become overstretched and vulnerable to a sudden reversal in risk appetite. The tech sector s valuation recently stood at its highest forward price-to-earnings multiple since 2004, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
And while technology stocks have tended to outperform during good times, they can also fall further than broader markets when risk appetite dries up. When the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 20% from its high in late 2018, the tech sector suffered a steeper 23% drop over that period."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday sharply criticized Tesla  Inc. s lack of system safeguards in a fatal 2018 Autopilot crash in California and called U.S. regulators  approach in overseeing the driver assistance systems ""misguided.""
NTSB board members questioned Tesla s design of its semi-automated driving assistance system and condemned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for a ""hands-off approach"" to regulating the increasingly popular systems.
NHTSA has ""taken a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety"" and should ""complete a further evaluation of the Tesla Autopilot system to ensure the deployed technology does not pose an unreasonable safety risk,"" NTSB said.
The board faulted Apple Inc  and other smartphone makers for refusing to disable devices when users are driving. It also called on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to use its authority to take action ""against ""employers who fail to address the hazards of distracted driving.""
The board s criticism posed a direct challenge to the auto industry’s efforts to profit from partially automated vehicles and the smartphone industry’s quest to keep user eyes on their devices.
The NTSB can only make recommendations, while NHTSA regulates U.S. vehicles. NHTSA has sent teams to investigate 14 Tesla crashes in which Autopilot is suspected of being in use, but taken no action against the company.
Concerns have grown about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.
""It s time to stop enabling drivers in any partially automated vehicle to pretend that they have driverless cars. Because they don t have driverless cars,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.
The Mountain View, California crash - involving a driver who was playing a game on his phone during the fatal trip - illustrates ""semi-autonomous vehicles can lead drivers to be complacent... and it also points out that smartphones manipulating them, can be so addictive, that people aren t going to put them down,"" Sumwalt added.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and recovered logs showed a word-building game was active.
The probable cause of Huang s crash was Autopilot steering the vehicle off the highway ""due to system limitations, and the driver’s lack of response due to distraction likely from a cell phone game application and overreliance"" on Autopilot, the NTSB said. Huang on prior trips had intervened when Autopilot steered the vehicle toward the same ""highway gore"" area. 
NHTSA said it will carefully review the NTSB s recommendations. The agency added that commercial motor vehicles ""require the human driver to be in control at all times.""
Tesla drivers are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, but Tesla advises keeping hands on the wheel and paying attention.
Sumwalt said Tesla allowed drivers to remove their hands from the wheel for up to three minutes under certain conditions when using Autopilot. 
The NTSB said Tesla added safeguards to require quicker warnings at higher speeds for drivers without hands on the wheel.
Regulators in Europe place limitations on Autopilot use and Tesla issues alerts there for hands-off driving within 15 seconds, the NTSB said.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg called Autopilot ""completely inadequate"" and noted Tesla vehicles have repeatedly crashed into large obstacles. 
Sumwalt said Tesla - unlike five other auto manufacturers - has ignored NTSB safety recommendations issued in 2017.
Tesla s Autopilot is tied to at least three deadly crashes since 2016 and suspected in others.
The NTSB will release in coming days the probable cause of a third Tesla Autopilot fatal crash in March 2019 in Florida that showed no evidence the driver’s hands were on the steering wheel in the final 8 seconds before striking a semi-trailer truck.
The NTSB also called on cellphone manufacturers to add more safeguards to prevent the misuse of devices by drivers.

Sumwalt noted that Apple does not have a distracted driving policy, but said it should have one. Apple says it expects its employees to follow the law."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market is likely to rack up solid gains this year, but it s vulnerable to a correction if the effect of the coronavirus outbreak worsens or the U.S. presidential race rattles investors, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.
The S&P 500 index (SPX) will end 2020 at 3,400, according to the median forecast of over 50 stock market analysts, strategists and fund managers polled by Reuters in the past two weeks. That would represent about a 5.2% gain over 2019 s close and an 8.7% gain from Tuesday s close of 3,128.21.
Many of the targets were taken before a dramatic tumble in world stocks early this week. A surge in coronavirus cases outside China and worries of a potential pandemic drove major U.S. stocks indexes down and left both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average in the red for the year.
The latest forecast for the S&P 500 is up from November, when strategists last surveyed by Reuters predicted the index would reach 3,260 by the end of the year. Professional investors  targets about stock market performance often miss the mark, but they are useful as an indication of market sentiment.
Worries have been mounting about the effect of the virus on the global economy and on earnings, especially after market heavyweight Apple  last week said it would fall short of its quarterly sales target because of slower iPhone production and weaker demand in China.
Not all poll participants see a significant market correction this year, but many of those who expect one see the coronavirus s impact as the most likely trigger.
Investors have been worried about valuations following recent record highs in the market. The S&P 500 index is trading at 19 times forward earnings, well above the long-term average of roughly 15 times, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We re at the upper end of valuations, and it will require material earnings growth to push us higher,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
""That earnings growth is only likely to materialize if there s decent economic growth. And right now economic data does not point to a strengthening economy.""
After a lackluster year of profit growth in 2019, some investors have been hoping corporate earnings this year will be strong enough to support further market gains. Analysts are estimating profit growth of 7.8% for S&P 500 companies in 2020, based on Refinitiv s data.
Many strategists take comfort in the view interest rates are low and the chances of the United States entering an economic recession this year also remain low.
""The risk of a recession right now is very well-contained, so unless something breaks down on the economic front or the coronavirus issue becomes more problematic than the market is currently discounting or something like that, then there s no reason to believe the market is not going to continue to grind higher,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse   Securities in New York. He sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 3,600.
As concerns over the spreading coronavirus outbreak hammer U.S. stocks, investors are also in the early stages of gauging another potential risk to the market later this year: the U.S. presidential election.
So far, the market impact has mostly shown up in healthcare shares. Insurers fell on Monday as Democrat Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator whose agenda includes a national ""Medicare for All"" health plan, scored a recent win in the Nevada caucuses.
The poll also showed the Dow (DJI) finishing 2020 at 30,342, which would represent a gain of 6.3% from the end of 2019. The Dow closed at 27,081.36 on Tuesday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled nearly $3.3 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week, snapping the longest streak of asset gains since July, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The pullback from the U.S. equity market came during a week in which companies such as Apple Inc  said the coronavirus outbreak, now known as covid-19, will likely affect its quarterly results and could weigh on its supply chain.
Concerns about the global economic impact of the virus helped push the benchmark S&P 500 down nearly 7.3% since Feb 19, according to Refinitiv data. The index is now down nearly 3% since the start of the year.
For the year to date, investors have pulled $26.7 billion from funds that invest in U.S. stocks.
Fixed income funds garnered nearly $14.9 billion in new assets, continuing a winning streak that has pulled in nearly $119 billion into the category since the start of the year."

(Reuters) - Apple  Inc s shareholders on Wednesday defeated a proposal critical of its removal of apps at the request of the Chinese government, but the proposal drew a much higher proportion of votes than similar proposals in previous years which had gained support only in single-digit percentages.
The proposal had called on the iPhone maker to report whether it has ""publicly committed to respect freedom of expression as a human right."" Shareholders defeated it, with 59.4% voting against and 40.6% voting in favor.
The proposal highlighted Apple s 2017 removal of virtual private network apps https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-apple-vpn/apple-says-it-is-removing-vpn-services-from-china-app-store-idUSKBN1AE0BQ from its App Store in China. Such apps allow users to bypass China’s so-called Great Firewall aimed at restricting access to overseas sites.
Apple shareholders have voted down human rights measures related to China in the past. They defeated a 2018 proposal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-shareholders/apple-ceo-downplays-special-dividend-at-shareholder-meeting-idUSKCN1FX2GA that urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China, with 94.4% of shareholders voting against it.
Apple opposed this year s proposal, saying the company already provides extensive information about when it takes down apps at the request of governments around the world and that it follows the laws in countries where it operates. 
"" (W)hile we may disagree with certain decisions at times, we do not believe it would be in the best interests of our users to simply abandon markets, which would leave consumers with fewer choices and fewer privacy protections,"" Apple said in its opposition.
Proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both recommended votes in favor the measure, according to reports from them seen by Reuters.
The freedom of expression proposal was one of six to be voted upon at the company s annual shareholder meeting at Apple s headquarters in Cupertino, California.
By wide margins, shareholders approved Apple s executive pay, existing board of directors and the retention of Ernst & Young as its accounting firm, results that were widely expected.
Shareholders defeated a ""proxy access"" proposal to allow shareholders to nominate more than one director to Apple s board, with 68.9% voting against and 31.1% voting for. They also voted down a measure to tie executive compensation to environmental sustainability metrics, with 87.9% voting against and 12.1% for. 

Apple had opposed both proposals."

Investing.com - Wall Street struggled again Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P giving up very strong gains to close in the red again as signs the spread of the coronavirus outside mainland in China is gathering pace. But techs helped the Nasdaq snap a four-day losing streak.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 124 points, or 0.46%, after rising more than 400 points in early trading. The S&P 500 lost 0.38% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.17%
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar confirmed a new case of the coronavirus in the U.S., taking the total to 15 so far.

The update came on the heels of reports that Nassau County health officials placed 83 Americans in self-quarantine after they return to New York from China. So far, 27 people have tested negative out of the 83 in quarantine.

A rise in cases elsewhere also stoked concerns that the spread of the virus is intensifying, with Germany s health minister warning the country is at the beginning of a coronavirus epidemic.
The reports unnerved investors and triggered a sea of red across stocks, turning the broader market negative.
Energy stocks erased early-day gains, ending the day 3% lower, as fears about weaker oil demand offset data showing a smaller-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude supplies.

Tech stocks also shed gains, but ended in positive territory overall, supported by a climb in shares of Oracle , Nvidia  and Apple .

Quarterly earnings also garnered investor attention but did little to influence direction.

SAN FRANCISCO/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Travel restrictions to China because of the coronavirus have come just as Apple  Inc s engineers usually jet off to Asia to perfect the production of this fall s new iPhones, former employees and supply chain experts told Reuters.
High-volume manufacturing is not scheduled until summer, but the first months of the year are when Apple irons out assembly processes with partners such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co s Foxconn, two former Apple employees said.
""They probably have one assembly line they re trying things out on,"" said one of the former employees who asked not to be named discussing production matters.
""Are Apple s engineers with the Foxconn engineers? If they are, they re probably making progress. But if they re not, if they re quarantined, that could be bad.""
While Apple uses other contract manufacturers such as Wistron Corp to make some iPhones, Taiwan s Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new models because its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts said.
Foxconn, the world s largest contract electronics maker, delayed reopening key iPhone factories in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou after the Lunar New Year holiday but hopes to resume half of its Chinese production by the end of February.
Senior Foxconn officials who have been working remotely from Taipei since the holiday have not yet returned to China on a large scale, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, speaking of company officials generally.
Apple declined to comment. Foxconn Technology Group said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the company is following all legally required health and safety practices at its factories to protect employee welfare. 
""Consistent with this, we are taking a cautious approach in the implementation of our post-holiday production schedules in each of our facilities in China,"" the company said.
Last week, Apple warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first three months of 2020 and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected.
Foxconn said this month that the coronavirus outbreak would lower its revenue this year.
Earlier this month, United Airlines, which has disclosed that Apple is a major customer, said it was cancelling all fights to China until late April. Apple, meanwhile, said on Jan. 28 that it was restricting employee to travel to China to ""business-critical"" situations.
COLLABORATION CRITICAL
For new iPhone models, the transition from prototype to the assembly of millions of units starts in earnest when the Lunar New Year holiday in China ends in late January and early February, people familiar with the process said.
At that point, Apple has tested numerous prototypes and is in the late stages of what is called engineering validation, in which Foxconn workers assemble small numbers of devices while engineers from both firms troubleshoot.
If delays occur at this stage it would eat into the time Apple needs to finalize orders for chips and other parts, almost all of which are custom-made for the iPhone.
Because of the huge volumes needed, ""they can t wait to make component selections"", said Ron Keith, founder of Supply Chain Resources Group, which works with electronics makers such as Alphabet  Inc s Nest.
In March and April, Apple engineers typically work with Foxconn counterparts to set up new assembly lines and do trial runs, before making final adjustments in April and May. The aim is to have production lines up and running in June so others can be added progressively to ramp up output.
""It s very complicated. There are so many variables in the environment, including small factors such as air pollution,"" one of the people familiar with the process said. 
Anna-Katrina Shedletsky, a former Apple engineer and founder of Instrumental, a startup focused on factory automation based in Mountain View, California, said on-the-ground engineering collaboration was critical for new products.
""You can fly those engineers somewhere else but there s knowledge about how you make a product in that environment. It s not that it can t be taught but it s a hard thing to move,"" she said. 
While supply chain experts and industry insiders say Apple still has time to keep its annual iPhone schedule on track, travel restrictions have left it in a tough spot.
""There is no face-to-face work being done,"" an executive at a semiconductor firm that supplies smartphone companies and works with teams in China said, speaking generally about phone production cycles.

""And the word is, that s probably not going to change for another month at best. You re really talking about two lost months, which in the consumer electronics cycle is huge."""

March contracts on the S&P 500 Index were down 1.4% as of 2:35 p.m. in Tokyo, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the patient doesn’t appear to have traveled to China or been exposed to another known case of the virus. Contracts also dropped after a speech by President Donald Trump failed to assuage investors’ concerns of the novel coronavirus derailing global growth. Euro Stoxx 50 futures declined 2.7%.
“President Trump’s press conference was certainly intended to be a confidence builder but I don’t believe it will have much impact on stocks,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “The drop in futures illustrates that words from politicians are meaningless. I believe it will take assurances from the Fed to send futures in the opposite direction.”
Trump sought to calm markets after one of the worst stretches for American stocks in almost five years. The underlying index is mired in a five-day losing streak that wiped out more than $2 trillion in value from American equities.
The U.S. urged travelers to reconsider trips to South Korea as the country’s number of cases rose to more than 1,500. New infections were diagnosed in countries from Pakistan to Brazil. Saudi Arabia halted religious visits that include stops in Mecca and Medina.
“Investors will be looking at today’s New York open very closely, and despite comments from President Trump I think the initial move will be to the downside,” said Nick Twidale, general manager of IC Markets in Sydney. “Then the focus will increase on mainland U.S.A. to see if more cases become apparent.”
On Wednesday, the S&P 500 plunged more than 7% from records set just a week ago, as investors grew concerned the virus will derail global economic growth. The number of companies warning the virus’s spread would impact sales and earnings jumped, with the likes of Apple Inc ., Mastercard Inc . and United Airlines Holdings Inc.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.4% in a turbulent session, failing to hold a gain that at one point topped 1.7%. Fresh warnings of a pandemic from German and American officials added to the gloom, while  Diageo   Plc and  Danone  SA  said that the outbreak will hit sales in China. The first cases in Greece and in South America emerged, while Spain locked down a seaside resort hotel with about 1,000 guests and workers inside.
The president sought to ease the market sell-off after Monday brought the worst rout in two years, tweeting, “Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” While that failed to stanch the bleeding, it echoed a prior Trump attempt to juice the market. On Christmas Day 2018, he called the bottom of a near three-month sell-off in U.S. equities."

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets plunged again at the opening on Thursday, as data showed new cases of the coronavirus outside of China exceeding those inside the country for the first time.
Sentiment was also depressed by more corporate warnings about the hit to earnings and revenue, with AB Inbev spin-off Budweiser APAC reporting a drop in sales and   Standard Chartered    saying it still couldn’t estimate the scale of the damage. Overnight, Microsoft  had joined Apple  in saying it would miss its guidance for the current quarter.
By 3:35 AM ET (8:35 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 10.1 points or 2.5%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 2.6% and the German DAX was down 2.3% and the French CAC 40 was down 2.4%.
“We’re now in a situation where fear rather than reality is the main economic threat,” said UBS Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan said in a morning podcast, with an eye on business confidence data due out later from the European Commission.
With a deluge of companies reporting, what stood out were negative updates even from companies with relatively little exposure to the virus. In the U.K., Reckitt Benckiser took a multibillion write-down on its acquisition of baby-food maker Mead Johnson, while NMC Health ousted its chief executive Prasanth Manghat and put its chief financial officer on extended leave after an internal investigation unearthed accounting discrepancies.
Overnight, however, Chinese stocks had risen amid further evidence that the virus outbreak is receding there.  Even so, Zhang Nanshang, a noted Chinese virologist, said he didn’t expect the outbreak to be fully under control until April (he had earlier eyed mid-February).

In other markets, Brent crude extended its declines as markets priced in a wider drop in demand for fuel due to the outbreak, while gold futures kept above $1,651 an ounce. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield fell another 2 basis points to -0.52%.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway s sovereign wealth fund, the world s largest, made a 19.9% return on investment last year, earning a record 1.69 trillion Norwegian crowns ($180 billion) as stock markets rallied, it said on Thursday.
The $1.1 trillion fund s return for the year was stronger than that of its benchmark index, it added.
""2019 has been a very good year for the fund ... this is the greatest increase in value in a single year in the fund s history,"" said central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen, who chairs the fund s board.
Last year s return on investment amounted to almost $34,000 for each of the 5.3 million people living in Norway, and the overall value of the fund is now equivalent to about $207,000 for every man, woman and child.
The fund holds stakes in more than 9,000 companies globally, owning 1.5% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds and real estate.
Apple Inc  and  Microsoft Corp   contributed the most to the fund s return in 2019, followed by Nestle SA , while the worst performers were Nokia Oyj ,  Pfizer  Inc  and  Swedbank  AB (ST:SWEDa), it said.
The fund, which saves revenue from the oil and gas industry, is now worth three times Norway s annual gross domestic product, and its returns provide vital funding for the country s extensive welfare state.
The 2019 accounts were the final annual report of Chief Executive Yngve Slyngstad, who announced late last year he will soon step down after a dozen years in the job.
A successor to Slyngstad, yet to be appointed by the board of the central bank, is expected to take charge within the next few months.

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of the coronavirus on U.S. soil with no links to China, while the virus continues to spread across Asia and Europe. Global stocks have reacted negatively to the news and U.S. markets are set to open in risk-off mode again, with bond yields testing record lows - not least due to Microsoft s warning late on Wednesday that it will miss its quarterly sales target. Budweiser brewer AB Inbev s latest figures also showed it has been hit hard by the collapse of social drinking in China.  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, February 27th.
1. Coronavirus in U.S. makes a big step
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of the coronavirus on U.S. soil with no links to China, raising fears that the ‘community spread’ of which the CDC warned earlier in the week will soon become reality.
On Wednesday evening, President Donald Trump had put Vice-President Mike Pence in charge of coordinating the U.S.’s response to the outbreak. Trump said the risk to the American people “remains very low.”
Elsewhere, Japan ordered its schools to shut from March 2 to stop the outbreak spreading, while Saudi Arabia said it would refuse to accept pilgrims travelling to religious sites such as Mecca and Medina.
The number of confirmed cases in South Korea continued to rise sharply, while a woman in Japan tested positive for the virus for the second time, proving that re-infection is possible.  In China, a leading virologist who predicted the outbreak would be contained by mid-February pushed back his timeline for that to April.
2. Global stocks retreat again

Global stocks and bond yields fell, with the exception of China, amid increasing signs that the viral outbreak is abating there. China announced fewer new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday than South Korea.

European stocks fell as much as 2.5%, spooked by the news out of the U.S. and by the disease’s spread through Europe. Airlines and travel companies were again particularly hard hit, with the continent’s discount flyers all down over 21% in the last week.
By 6:35 AM ET, the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 2.5%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 2.1%.

3. U.S. to open in risk-off mode; Microsoft s sales warning hurts mood
Risk aversion is set to be in full flood again when U.S. markets open, as participants reprice the threat to corporate earnings. Microsoft  joined Apple  last night in saying it would miss its first-quarter sales target, without giving a new one.

By 6:35 AM ET, the Dow 30 futures contract was down 265 points, or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 1.0% and the Nasdaq 100 contract down 0.9%.

U.S. government bond yields have collapsed this week as appetite for haven assets has soared. The Fed-sensitive 2-year bond yield has fallen to 1.11%, implying at least two 25 basis point cuts from the Federal Reserve over the next couple of years. The 10-year Treasury yield meanwhile hit a new record low of 1.29% overnight.
Gold futures are firm above $1,650 an ounce, while U.S. crude futures have fallen over 2% to their lowest since the end of 2018 at $47.59 a barrel. Brent was also down over 2% at $51.59.
4. AB Inbev hit hard by virus in China

The world’s biggest brewer has the sector’s biggest problems. Anheuser Busch Inbev   stock fell 9.3% after reporting extremely weak figures for the fourth quarter of 2019, blaming commodity and foreign exchange factors for exaggerating the slowing trend in global beer consumption.
Net profit fell 75% from a year ago and revenue fell 1.3%, despite a 1.1% rise in sales volume, suggesting that the company’s efforts at premiumization – squeezing more value out of a stable of brands that includes Budweiser and Michelob – are struggling to make headway.
Budweiser APAC, which was spun out of the parent company last year, issued a particularly stark warning that the Covid-19 outbreak had caused sales in China to fall by $285 million in the first two month of the year, as restaurants, bars and other nightlife venues suffered. That will translate into a $170 million hit to EBITDA over those months, it added.

It’s a busy day for corporate earnings, with Workday, Autodesk, EOG Resources, Occidental and Monster Beverage all set to report.
5. U.S. GDP revision, durable goods and jobless claims all due

The U.S. will update its estimate for gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of last year at 8:30 AM ET, but those backward-looking numbers are likely to be overshadowed by durable goods orders for January and last week’s initial jobless claims, both of which are due at the same time.

Data released earlier in Europe showed no major hit to European consumer or business confidence so far, the European Commission’s economic sentiment index rising more strongly than expected to 103.5, the highest since June.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 1.1% last month, the largest gain since January 2019. There were increases in orders for machinery, primary metals, computers and electronics products. But demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell last month.
Data for December was revised up to show these so-called core capital goods orders falling 0.5% instead of declining 0.8% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders edging up 0.1% in January.
Core capital goods orders increased 1.4% on a year-on-year basis in January.
Shipments of core capital goods rebounded 1.1% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement. They fell by an upwardly revised 0.1% in December. They were previously reported to have slipped 0.3% in December.
The rebound in core capital goods orders and shipments at the start of the year likely suggests some stabilization in business investment, which has contracted for three straight quarters. The business investment slump has undercut manufacturing, which is facing supply chain disruptions from the corononavirus, especially for electronics producers like Apple. 
Data firm IHS Markit said last Friday its flash Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the U.S. manufacturing and services sectors, contracted to a 76-month low in February.
The coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and spread to other countries, has caused a rout on Wall Street and stock markets around the globe. Money markets have increased their bets on the prospect of more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times last year and has signaled its intention to keep monetary policy on hold at least through 2020.
Capital expenditure has been undercut by the White House s 19-month trade war with China, which has hurt business confidence. A ""Phase 1"" trade deal signed between Washington and Beijing in January left the bulk of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in place. Manufacturing is also taking a hit from Boeing s  decision to halt the production of its troubled 737 MAX plane starting last month.
In January, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, slipped 0.2% after surging 2.9% in the prior month. Durable goods orders were held down by a 2.2% drop in orders for transportation equipment, which followed an 8.8% jump in December.
Orders for civilian aircraft soared 346.2% last month after plunging 66.7% in December. This was despite Boeing reporting this month that it booked no new orders for airplanes in January, the first time it has come up empty-handed in January since 1962. It received only three commercial aircraft orders in December."

(Reuters) - Futures indicated that the Dow Jones Industrials index would shed more than 300 points at the open on Thursday after the rapid spread of the coronavirus outside China deepened worries about growth and corporate earnings.
The number of new infections in China, the source of the outbreak, was overtaken for the first time by fresh cases elsewhere on Wednesday, most notably in Italy and Iran.
Adding to worries, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed an infection in California in a person who reportedly did not have relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient.
""In the recent week, markets have come to realize that the outbreak is much worse and are now realistically pricing in the impact of the virus on the economy,"" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank.
""In that sense it s a bit of a catching up from the relative optimism that was there in the beginning when markets thought (the virus) will be contained to China with some minor outbreak outside.""
After hitting a record high last week, the S&P 500 (SPX) has declined for five straight sessions and has lost about $1.84 trillion in market capitalization this week alone.
Industry analysts and economists continued to sound the alarm as they assessed the impact of the coronavirus, with Goldman Sachs  saying U.S. firms will generate no earnings growth in 2020.
Bank of America  slashed its world growth forecast to the lowest level since the peak of the global financial crisis.
At 8:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 334 points, or 1.24%. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 40.5 points, or 1.3% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 129.25 points, or 1.46%.

“Our reduced forecasts reflect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity in the first quarter, lower end-demand for U.S. exporters, supply chain disruption, a slowdown in U.S. economic activity, and elevated uncertainty,” the strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Thursday.
More and more companies, including Apple Inc ., Mastercard Inc . and United Airlines Holdings Inc., are starting to warn investors about the impact of the epidemic on their profit outlooks. The virus has reminded the world how exposed major U.S. corporations are to Chinese supplies and economic stability.
The Goldman strategists reduced their baseline earnings-per-share estimates by 5.2% to $165 for this year, representing zero growth, and cut the forecast for next year by 4.4% to $175, which indicates an increase of 6%. That compares with a prediction of a 7.9% advance in earnings in 2020 among companies in the S&P 500 Index, according to Bloomberg estimates, and 11% growth for 2021.
The U.S. stock market will fall another 7% from the Wednesday close in the near term as investor fears over the spreading coronavirus fuel a rush into U.S. Treasuries, sinking the yield to 1%, according to Goldman. However, by the end of the year, the S&P 500 will rebound to 3,400, which is about 9% above the current level, as lower bond yields will offset a reduction in earnings, they said.
The strategists recommended investors shift to more defensive U.S. sectors in light of slowing economic growth. They raised real estate to overweight and utilities to neutral, while cutting industrials to neutral and lowering financials to underweight."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock market plunged again on Thursday as participants took fright at the prospect of the coronavirus outbreak disrupting U.S. economic life.

By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 437 points or 1.6% at 26,475 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8%. All three indices were slightly paring initial losses which extended to as much as 2.4%.
One of the biggest losers was Microsoft  stock, which fell 3.9% after the software giant joined Apple  in saying that it would miss its first-quarter sales guidance. Microsoft said it expects weakness in its personal computing division, which covers Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles. That accounts for over one-third of group revenue.
Another big loser was Budweiser brewer Anheuser Busch Inbev  stock, which fell 8.3% after forecasting a dismal first quarter due to the collapse of social drinking in China in January and February.  The world’s biggest brewer also said in its quarterly report that it continued to lose market share in the U.S. to hard seltzers.
Booking  stock fell 4.1% after the operator of travel websites warned of a “significant and negative impact” to earnings from the coronavirus, although its fourth-quarter results came in ahead of expectations.
The company said EBITDA in the first quarter would be around $575 million, some 20% below consensus forecasts.

Adding to the general virus-related concerns, U.S. initial jobless claims rose for the third week in a row, while durable goods orders in January also fell short of expectations.

Elsewhere, Virgin Galactic  stock continued its plummet back to earth, falling 15.3% after Wednesday’s decline of 15.5%. While its down by one-third from its peak only one week ago, it has still more than doubled since listing late last year.

Oil and gas stocks continued to feel the pressure of falling crude prices, which is increasingly putting their debt-servicing capabilities into question. Continental Resources  stock plunged 28% to its lowest since the oil price collapse of 2015, after the company said late on Wednesday that its free cash flow will stagnate, while output growth this year will be less than half the group’s medium-term target."

California Monitoring 8,400 Travelers  and Contacts (2:16 p.m.)
California is monitoring 8,400 people who flew into its airports from Asia and their close contacts for possible infection from the novel coronavirus, Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday.Those people are scattered across 49 local jurisdictions, he said. There have been 33 people confirmed to be infected with the virus in California.
Earlier, health officials said a woman from Northern California has the virus and hadn’t traveled to China. She also didn’t have any close contact with anyone who did and appears to be the first case of community transmission in the U.S.
Azar Says U.S.-Funded Drug, Vaccine Must Be Accessible (12:30 p.m. NY)
Any drug or vaccine developed by companies with help from the government must be financially accessible for people, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress Thursday.
“I have directed my teams that if we do any joint venture with a private enterprise that we’re cofunding the research and development program that we would ensure there’s access to the fruits of that, whether vaccine or therapeutics,” Azar said at a congressional hearing. The U.S. government is collaborating with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms to develop vaccines and drugs for the coronavirus.
Azar’s comments are a shift from remarks Wednesday, when he said, “we would want to ensure that we work to make it affordable, but we can’t control that price, because we need the private sector to invest. Price controls won’t get us there.”
Azar’s new comments came after he was criticized Wednesday evening by Senator Bernie Sanders, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. On Twitter, Sanders called Azar’s remarks “outrageous.”
Lagarde: ECB Response Not Required Yet (11:30 a.m. NY)
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the coronavirus outbreak carefully isn’t yet at the stage that would require a monetary-policy response, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.
Lagarde said the ECB would have to determine whether the coronavirus could become a “long-lasting shock” that would affect inflation. “But we are certainly not at that point yet,” Lagarde told the FT.
Outbreak Is At Decisive Stage, WHO Says (10:10 a.m. NY)
The novel coronavirus has the potential to become a pandemic and is at a decisive stage, the head of the World Health Organization said Thursday.
“The outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during the group’s daily briefing in Geneva.
China’s efforts show that containment can work, while clusters of infections in Iran, Italy and South Korea are cause for concern, he said. For a second day, there were fewer new cases in China than in the rest of the world.
Several countries that have reported cases previously -- including India, Russia and Vietnam -- haven’t had any new infections in two weeks, Tedros said. However, Finland and Sweden, which had gone without infections for a prolonged period, reported cases Wednesday.

Any drug or vaccine developed by companies with help from the government must be financially accessible for people, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress Thursday.

The U.S. government is collaborating with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms to develop vaccines and drugs for the coronavirus.
Azar’s comments are a shift from remarks Wednesday, when he said, “we would want to ensure that we work to make it affordable, but we can’t control that price, because we need the private sector to invest. Price controls won’t get us there.”
Azar’s new comments came after he was criticized Wednesday evening by Senator Bernie Sanders, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. On Twitter, Sanders called Azar’s remarks “outrageous.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew moderately in the fourth quarter, the government confirmed, and is facing a bumpy road in early 2020 amid the fast-spreading coronavirus that has left financial markets fearing a recession. 
Though other data on Thursday suggested some stabilizing in business investment in January and the labor market remained solid, that failed to calm jittery investors. Wall Street s main indexes dropped for the sixth straight session and slid into correction territory. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched an all-time low for the third consecutive day.
""Markets are voting and saying they think the U.S. is on its way to recession,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""And frankly at this stage after the coronavirus-related slowdown in travel plans that has busted the global supply chain apart, it will be a miracle if we avoid a recession."" Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate, supported by a smaller import bill, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. That was unrevised from last month s advance estimate and matched the growth pace logged in the July-September quarter. 
The economy grew by an unrevised 2.3% in 2019, the slowest annual growth in three years and missing the White House s 3% growth target for a second straight year. 
Financial markets see the coronavirus epidemic as the catalyst that could break the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11t year. This could hurt President Donald Trump who is seeking a second term in office in the Nov. 3 election. Trump on Wednesday assured Americans the risk from coronavirus remained ""very low,"" and said public health officials were preparing to do ""whatever we have to,"" to deal with the outbreak. 
The coronavirus has killed more than 2,000 people and infected at least 80,000 people, most of them in China. Money markets have boosted their bets on the prospect of more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times last year. The coronavirus outbreak will challenge the Fed s view to keeping monetary policy on hold at least through 2020.
Though there is so far no real evidence that the coronavirus epidemic is impacting the U.S. economy, economists expect the struggling manufacturing sector to take a hit through supply chain disruptions and exports. 
Apple  has already warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first quarter and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected.
Pain for the services sector could come via the travel and tourism industry. The stock market sell-off if it persists could erode consumer confidence and hurt consumer spending, which is already slowing. Economists also worry that corporate profits could come under pressure and undercut the labor market, the economy s main pillar of support. 
Despite the unrevised reading to last quarter s GDP growth, which was in line with economists  expectations, consumer spending slowed more than previously reported. There were also downgrades to business investment and government spending, offseting upward revisions to investment in homebuilding and inventory accumulation. 
WEAK DOMESTIC DEMAND
Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at a 1.3% rate in the fourth quarter, the slowest in four years. This measure of domestic demand was previously reported to have risen at a 1.4% pace in the fourth quarter.
Business investment fell at a steeper 2.3% rate in the fourth quarter, instead of the previously reported 1.5% pace. It was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009. There were downward revisions last quarter to spending on equipment, mostly light trucks. 
Investment in intellectual property products like software was also downgraded, eclipsing upgrades to spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells. Business investment could, however, be stabilizing. 
A second report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 1.1% last month, the largest gain since January 2019.
But these tentative signs that the business investment downturn could be drawing to an end could prove temporary.
""At the beginning of 2020 the outlook for manufacturing was for a modest rebound from the softness that characterized 2019,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup   in New York. ""However, the economic impacts of the virus may disrupt the nascent recovery.""
In addition to the coronavirus epidemic, Boeing s  suspending of production of its troubled 737 MAX plane starting last month is expected to weigh on the factory sector. Goldman Sachs  on Sunday cut its first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2% annualized rate. Growth estimates for the January-March quarter were already on the low side because of Boeing s biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years. 
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.7% pace in the fourth quarter, instead of the previously reported 1.8% rate. A strong rebound is unlikely, especially if the stock market rout spreads to the labor market. A separate report on Thursday showed applications for unemployment benefits increased 8,000 to 219,000 last week, though the underlying trend remained consistent with solid labor market conditions.

The decrease in imports in the fourth quarter, in part because of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, compressed the trade deficit. Trade added 1.53 percentage points to GDP growth, rather than the 1.48 percentage points reported last month. That was the most since the second quarter of 2009. Inventories rose at a $13.0 billion rate in the fourth quarter, instead of the $6.5 billion rate reported in January. Inventory investment sliced 0.98 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter."

Several big names in the U.S. consumer and tech sectors have already warned of a hit from the rapid spread of the epidemic that has disrupted supply chains, hurt global travel and led to temporary shutdowns of businesses.
Here s a list of some big names from Corporate America that have announced a financial impact from the outbreak.
** Apple Inc  warned it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales forecast as the iPhone maker s manufacturing facilities in China were ramping up slower than expected.
** Microsoft Inc  said it does not expect to meet its quarterly revenue forecast for its Windows and personal computing business due to a hit to its supply chain.
** PC maker HP Inc  said it factored in an 8 cents per share impact into its second-quarter profit outlook as it expects coronavirus outbreak to hit its businesses and supplies.
**  Canada Goose Holdings  Inc   forecast an annual revenue hit of up to C$51.6 million.
** Versace owner Capri Holdings Ltd  warned of a $100 million hit from the outbreak and cut its annual revenue forecast.
**  Estee Lauder  Cos Inc  trimmed its fiscal 2020 per-share earnings forecast, in part due to the impact from the outbreak.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Microsoft Corp   fell 4% on Thursday after the company warned of weakness in its PC business after a hit to its supply chain from the coronavirus outbreak, echoing similar statements from Apple Inc  and HP .
The selloff in shares wiped off nearly $50 billion from Microsoft s market value on a day broader markets tumbled about 2% on rising fears of a global pandemic.
The virus has infected about 80,000 people, killed nearly 2,800 and spread to 44 countries, and is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
Microsoft said on Wednesday its supply chain was taking longer to return to normal operations than expected, and its Windows and Surface computers had taken a bigger hit than feared.
The impact of the fast-spreading virus has taken a toll on companies across sectors, particularly technology companies as their supply chains in China come under strain.
Apple was the first big technology firm to say the epidemic was affecting its production and demand in China.  PayPal Holdings Inc   and Mastercard Inc  have also warned of a possible hit. 
Several Wall Street analysts said they expect other technology companies with strong China presence to follow suit.
""Given there seems to be weakness in the PC supply chain, it would seem highly likely to me that we hear something from  Intel Corp  ,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said in a mail.
Andrew MacMillen, an analyst with Nucleus Research, said PC makers Dell Technologies Inc  and Lenovo Group (HK:0992) could be seeing some difficulties.
Dell, the world s third-biggest PC maker after Lenovo Group (HK:0992) and HP, will report quarterly earnings after markets close on Thursday. It has a sizeable exposure to China.
Microsoft said it would miss its own third-quarter revenue forecast for the PC unit, which houses the Windows business.
J.P.Morgan analysts said Microsoft s outlook is a supply chain issue, not a demand issue, but it was possible that broad supply chain issues plus investors becoming increasingly averse to risk could metastasize into demand issues over time.
Research firm IDC on Thursday forecast 2020 PC shipments to fall 9% due to the outbreak.  
Apple warned earlier in February it was unlikely to meet its March quarter sales outlook due to the coronavirus impact.
""It feels to me that China is getting the coronavirus under control,"" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview with Fox Business Network, adding that iPhone components come from the United States as well as China.

Cook told the network that iPhone factories in China have re-opened and are in ""phase three of the ramp mode"" of returning to normal operations."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The video game ""Plague Inc"", which has surged in popularity amid the coronavirus epidemic, has been removed from Apple s China app store after regulators said it contained illegal content, its developer said.
The strategy game, where players create a pathogen to destroy the world, soared to the top of the China app store charts in January as consumers turned to virus-related games and films as a coping mechanism. It has also jumped in app rankings for other countries.
""This situation is completely out of our control,"" UK-based developer and publisher Ndemic Creations said in a statement, adding its immediate priority was to make contact with the Cyberspace Administration of China to understand its concerns and work towards a resolution.
The regulator did not respond to Reuters phone calls and faxes requesting comment on the matter. Apple Inc  and Ndemic did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
China has stringent rules on content from video games to movies to music and censors anything it believes violates core socialist values. Gaming companies must also seek licenses for the games they want to publish.
Although there was a brief window when public criticism of authorities  handling of the outbreak was allowed, censors have tightened their grip in recent weeks. WeChat groups and podcasts have been shut down while social media posts and articles have been deleted.
""The game may have simply been taken down due to sensitivities around the topic and gameplay of the title given the recent COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst with gaming research firm Niko Partners.
He added that it might be related to a new feature in the game which allows players to create ""fake news"" stories about the virus, noting other epidemic-related games albeit ones with some educational content were still available in China.
He said he didn t think the game s removal was related to an update Apple made this week that requires developers of revenue-generating mobile games on its Chinese site to obtain a license from the Chinese government as other unlicensed games had not been affected. Apple, which has lagged other app stores in enforcing this rule, has set a June deadline."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, and two other pro-democracy activists on Friday on charges of illegal assembly, drawing condemnation from international rights groups.
Lai, a self-made millionaire who has made financial contributions to Hong Kong s pro-democracy movement and has been a target of criticism for mainland Chinese media, was picked up by police at his house, Cable TV and TVB News reported.
Apple  Daily, one of the publications under media company Next Digital (HK:0282) in which Lai is non-executive chairman, said he was accused of participating in an illegal march on Aug. 31. The newspaper said Lai had followed a crowd along a central route for two hours on that day, singing hymns and praying.
Veteran democracy activists Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum were also arrested on Friday on the same charges, Cable TV reported.
""Earlier today, we arrested three local men, aged 63 to 72, for suspected participation in a non-approved gathering,"" Wong Tung Kwong, senior Hong Kong police superintendent of criminal deployment, told a media briefing. 
The three have been charged and will appear in court on May 5, he said. Police did not name those arrested, as per its standard practice. It also gave no further details.
Lai was seen by a Reuters reporter leaving the Kowloon City police station in a black Mercedes on Friday. He gave no comment.
""The charges will not hinder our fight for democracy, freedom and our human right to continue to gather, march and protest,"" Lee told reporters in front of the Cheung Sha Wan police station. 
Lai and Yeung could not be reached immediately for comment.
ARRESTS CRITICIZED
The arrests come after a period of relative calm in the Asian financial hub following months of intense anti-government protests. 
Hong Kong saw one of its worst clashes on Aug. 31, with police firing tear gas and water cannons at pro-democracy protesters who threw petrol bombs.
Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested more than 7,000 people for their involvement in the protests, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody.
Public anger has grown over the months due to perceptions of China tightening its grip over the city. Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.
Lai was previously arrested in 2014 for refusing to leave a key pro-democracy protest site in the center of the city. Following his arrest he resigned as editor in chief of Apple Daily. He has also come under scrutiny from Hong Kong s anti-graft agency when they raided his home in 2014.
Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement it was concerned about the arrests and called on the Hong Kong authorities to ensure freedoms like the right to protest enshrined in the city s basic law are respected.
Amnesty International said the arrests were ""a shameless attempt to harass and silence those in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement"" and called for an independent inquiry into police s handling of the protests - a core demand of protesters.
Police has repeatedly said it has acted with restraint and has used minimum levels of force. 
Hong Kong Democracy Council, a Washington based non- government organization, said on Friday that the arrests were ""blatant acts of political suppression by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist Party"".
The group said in a statement it was demanding the immediate and unconditional release of Lai and the other pro-democracy activists.

The government did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. "

By Geoffrey Smith 

Investing.com -- Panic selling continued in the U.S. stock market on Friday, putting the market on course for its biggest weekly loss since 2008 amid growing signs that the coronavirus outbreak will ultimately cause an economic shock in Western economies as well as in China and its Asian trading partners. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened with another loss of 627 points, or 2.6%, taking it below the 25,000 mark. By 10:33 AM ET (1533 GMT), the DJIA was down 4%, or 1,034 points.
The S&P 500 was down 3.4%, at its lowest since October 2019. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, fell 2.7%. 

Overnight, another sharp jump in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Korea and Iran, coupled with new emergency virus containment measures in Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere, all contributed to keeping the mood negative. A better-than-expected monthly rise of 0.6% in U.S. personal income in January was of little consolation.
""The landscape remains very uncertain,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management in a weekly note. ""For now, there is a sense with the coronavirus that things will need to get worse before they can get better.""
He argued that the point of ""maximum bearishness"" could be another couple of weeks away. 
""This could coincide with the moment that Covid19 is officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization,"" something that could lay the groundwork for a coordinated response of policy stimulus, Dowding argued. Such hopes seem far away at the moment, with the U.S. and German governments both playing down the seriousness of the situation.

The bond market is now betting heavily on the Federal Reserve riding to the rescue. The2-Year Treasury bond yield dipped below 1% overnight and then roared lower to 0.91% after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard indicated that the Fed, if not fiscal policy, would react to a global pandemic.  
“Further policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time,” Bullard, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said Friday in prepared remarks to be delivered in Fort Smith, Arkansas.
Hot money continued to flood out of Tesla , which lost another 7.1%, taking its losses for the week to over 30%.

Beyond Meat  suffered similar problems following a surprise quarterly loss after the bell Thursday, losing 17.6%. It’s now down 25% for the week.

Apple  was also the subject of some heavy profit-taking, falling 5.1% to its lowest since December.  None of the companies mentioned released any news of note.

One stock emphatically bucking the trend was   Zoom Video Communications   , the maker of software for video conference calls. Zoom Video stock has been flying as participants price in a boom in such calls as Covid-19 spawns a global outbreak of working from home and restrictions on business travel."

By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – Wall Street selling was stemmed Friday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a rate cut after flagging the coronavirus as ""evolving risk"" to the economy.
 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 615 points, though had been down more than 1,000 points at the open. The S&P 500 slipped 1.07% and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.22%.
For weeks, Wall Street has been upping bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut, with some pricing in three consecutive cuts starting as soon as March. Powell on Friday, in an unscheduled statement, stoked rate-cut hopes, saying the central bank would act to support the economy after he conceded that the coronavirus was a threat to the economy.     
 

Goldman Sachs said today it estimates the Fed will cut rates by 75 basis points by June, indicating as many as three cuts, with the first cut expected to be delivered at its meeting next month.
The impromptu update from the Fed comes in the wake of a sharp uptick in cases in South Korea, as well as maiden infections reported in New Zealand and Nigeria. The World Health Organization on Friday raised its risk assessment of Covid-19 to a ""very high"" global level from ""high"" in late January, but stopped short of declaring a coming pandemic.
 

But inside of China, however, the pace of infections is slowing and authorities in the country have stepped up efforts to restore operations as factories reopen.
Apple’s factories in China are nearing full production, said Apple  CEO Time Cook, adding that he was “very optimistic” that China was getting a handle on the outbreak.

“It feels to me that China is getting the coronavirus under control. You look at the numbers, they’re coming down day by day by day.” Cook said.

After a brief foray into positive territory, Apple fell nearly 2%, triggering a u-turn in tech, with gains in Nvidia  and Micron  cut short. 

Energy stocks were also on the backfoot, amid a steep selloff in oil prices amid fears of weaker oil demand as the virus outbreak has hurt travel and tourism activity. 

Elsewhere, Beyond Meat  slumped 17% after the company reported a surprise quarterly loss, which offset better-than-expected revenue.

Apple counts major Korean display makers Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc among its suppliers. It also sources chips from a factory in Italy run by Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics , according to its most recent supplier list.
Cook told Fox Business Networks that Apple had re-opened 80 percent of its stores in China. He also said that iPhone factories in China had restarted and were in ""phase three of the ramp mode.""
""It will take some time, but by in large I think this is a temporary condition, not a long-term kind of thing,"" Cook said.
Asked if Apple would move manufacturing out of China to countries such as Vietnam or Cambodia, Cook said the company s supply chain was global and that the company considered speed to markets and engineering skills in addition to cost. He also said Apple s supply chain managers were examining how resilient to the coronavirus shock the company s supply chains were.
""And so the question for us after we get on the other side will be, was the resilience there or not and do we need to make some changes,"" he said. ""My perspective sitting here today is that if there are changes, you’re talking about adjusting some knobs, not some sort of wholesale fundamental change.""
Apple last week said it would not meet its guidance for the quarter ending in March and that it would experience supply chain shortages. Cook said he did not know whether the coronavirus would affect the quarter ending in June.
On Wednesday at Apple s annual shareholder meeting, Cook said Apple would open its first retail store in India."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street s worst week since 2008, sparked by fears about the fast-spreading coronavirus, has left almost half of the S&P 500 s stocks in bear market territory, just nine days after the leading benchmark closed at a record high.
With the world preparing for a pandemic and investors increasingly fearing that the coronavirus could lead to a recession, the S&P 500 (SPX) is on track to end the week down 13%, its worst week since 2008. 
After closing at a record high on Feb. 19, the index has slumped 14%, now in a correction, but most of its individual components are in far worse shape.
""As severe as the decline has been, and even if most of the damage has been done, it s hard to believe it will be over in a week,"" Wellington Shields & Co market analyst Frank Gretz warned in a client note on Friday. 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 components plummet from 52-week highs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2662/2627/Correction%20and%20bear.jpg) 
Forty-seven percent of the S&P 500 s components have fallen more than 20% from their 52-week highs, while another 51% have fallen more than 10%. Only about 10 S&P 500 stocks are down less than 10% from their highs, including healthcare companies Allergan  and Quest Diagnostics , as well as Clorox , which has benefited from expectations of increased demand for its disinfectant cleaning products.
Investors consider securities or market indexes that have fallen 20% or more from their highs, and that maintain those declines for a sustained amount of time, to be in a bear market.
A drop of 10% is widely viewed as correction in a larger, ongoing rally, or bull market.
All of the S&P 500 s 11 sectors have tumbled 10% or more from their year-highs, with energy s (SPNY) 33% drop the worst among them, and the consumer staples  (SPLRCS) sector s 11% decline the least.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com - Wall Street capped off Friday with its biggest weekly loss since the financial crisis. But the Federal Reserve s pledge to support the economy in wake of a growing coronavirus epidemic helped at the end of the day, with buyers coming in.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.38%. The S&P 500 slipped 0.83% and Nasdaq Composite ended flat.

Federal Reserve Chairman Powell on Friday, in an unscheduled statement, stoked rate-cut hopes, saying the central bank would act to support the economy after he conceded that the coronavirus was a threat to the economy.     

Investor sentiment was also boosted by reports the Trump administration is mulling economic responses to the coronavirus, including a targeted tax-cut package.
The rapid pace of the outbreak shows no sign of easing, with more than 82,000 cases reported worldwide, following a jump infection in South Korea and Italy this week. While Nigeria and New Zealand also reported their first infections. 
The World Health Organization on Friday raised its risk assessment of the Covid-19 to a ""very high"" global level from ""high"" in late January but stopped short of declaring a coming pandemic.
In mainland China, however, infections are slowing and authorities are ramping up efforts to open factories in a bid to alleviate supply chain disruptions.
“It feels to me that China isok getting the coronavirus under control. You look at the numbers, they’re coming down day by day by day.” Apple CEO Tim Cook said after claiming that Apple’s factories in China were nearing full production.
Apple  ended lower for the day, but the broader tech market was underpinned by rally in chip stocks, with bargain-hunting investors seemingly eager to snap up beaten-down semis like Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices  and Micron Technology .   
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index ended the day 2% higher.  

Energy stocks shrugged off a steep selloff in oil prices to end the day in positive, helping to spark a rebound in the broader market.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors had to contend with mixed quarterly reports. 
Beyond Meat   slumped 15% after the company reported a surprise quarterly loss, which offset better-than-expected revenue."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday said it would focus on concluding new trade agreements with Britain, the European Union and Kenya over the coming year, while strictly enforcing trade laws and pushing for reforms of the World Trade Organization.
In its annual report to the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Trade Representative s office said members of the global trade body needed to fundamentally rethink what it called ""an outdated tariff framework"" that no longer reflected economic realities. 
USTR delivered a scathing indictment of the WTO in the 338-page document, calling it an organization that had ""strayed far from its original mission and purpose,"" while highlighting the Trump administration s push over the past year to confront what it said were China s unfair trade policies and practices.
It said 2019 was ""a historic year for American trade"" in which the administration reached trade agreements with China and Japan, and secured congressional approval of a new North American trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
It also hailed a WTO decision giving Washington the right to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU goods in a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies to Airbus .
The U.S. government also initiated action against France over its digital services taxes that Washington says will harm U.S. tech companies such as Facebook , Alphabet Inc s Google , Amazon Inc  and Apple , and is monitoring developments in other countries, the report said.
Washington and Paris have agreed to a truce staving off those tariffs through year-end to allow work on broader tax reforms by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
""Going forward, President Trump will continue to rebalance America’s relationship with its trading partners, aggressively enforce our trade laws, and take prompt action in response to unfair trade practices by other nations,"" the report said.
In addition to pursuing trade agreements with Britain and the EU, USTR said it would work on trade agreements with new partners, including Kenya, which would be the first U.S. free trade deal in sub-Saharan Africa.
USTR said it hoped a recent change in EU leadership and appointment of a new trade commissioner would lead to ""more progress in the coming year"" than was possible in the past.
It said it also planned to conduct further negotiations with Japan and China to reach more comprehensive trade agreements, while continuing to push for reforms at the WTO.

""The WTO s failure to keep pace with new developments in the global economy has resulted in significant advantages for non-market economies,"" USTR wrote in the report, saying China in particular benefited from the WTO s deficiencies."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has expressed concern after Chinese-ruled Hong Kong arrested publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, and two pro-democracy activists.
The arrests come after a period of relative calm following months of anti-government protests over perceptions that China is tightening its grip on the city, though Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.
Lai and veteran democracy activists Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum, were arrested on Friday in the Asian financial hub on charges of illegal assembly, drawing condemnation from international rights groups, media said.
""We are concerned by the arrest of prominent Hong Kong businessman and publisher Jimmy Lai and two other longtime advocates for civil liberties and democracy,"" Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said on Friday.
""We expect Hong Kong authorities not to use law enforcement selectively for political purposes, and to handle cases fairly and transparently,"" she added in a statement.
The spokeswoman also called for the rule of law and Hong Kong people’s rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression to be preserved.
The police said three local men, aged 63 to 72, were arrested for suspected participation in a non-approved gathering but did not confirm their names.
Authorities in the former British colony have arrested more than 7,000 people for involvement in Hong Kong s protests, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody.
The arrest of the three men was outrageous, said Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, adding that there was no doubt its government was acting at Beijing s instructions.
""This decision will send yet another signal to the world that the Chinese Communist Party is intent on throttling decency and freedom in Hong Kong,"" Patten said.
Lai, a self-made millionaire who has made financial contributions to Hong Kong s pro-democracy movement and been a target of criticism by mainland Chinese media, was arrested in 2014 for refusing to leave a key pro-democracy protest site.
After the arrest he resigned as editor in chief of Apple  Daily. He has also come under scrutiny from Hong Kong s anti-graft agency, which raided his home in 2014.
In an editorial on Friday, China s state-owned Global Times tabloid called Lai ""a force of evil"", rather than the ""hero"" of democracy painted by the West."

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has amassed a stake in  Twitter Inc   and is pushing for changes, including removal of the social media company s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Twitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott.
Twitter shares fell last year when the company disclosed that its platform experienced glitches that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners. The San Francisco-based company s reluctance to expand beyond its core platform has also left it with limited scale compared to its larger social media peers.
Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, will be seeking to install its own nominees to Twitter s eight-member board when three of the company s directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, the sources said.
It is not clear who Elliott would like Dorsey replaced with and how big its stake in Twitter is. The New York-based hedge fund has more than $40 billion in assets under management, and has targeted companies in recent months ranging from eBay Inc  to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Elliott declined to comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg News first reported on Friday on Elliott s position in Twitter.
Dorsey, 43, is one of Silicon Valley s most prominent entrepreneurs, and also runs  Square Inc  , a mobile payments company he co-founded.
While investors have tolerated this arrangement since 2015, when Dorsey became Twitter s CEO for the second time, his announcement in November that he would like to move to Africa for up to six months raised questions among analysts about his management.
Dorsey, who helped conceive Twitter in 2006, first served as CEO until 2008, when he was replaced by one of his co-founders Ev Williams . Williams had accused Dorsey of being a poor manager and not focusing enough on Twitter s profitability.
Dorsey returned as interim CEO after his predecessor Dick Costolo stepped down. Dorsey s knowledge of the company and quick launch of new products convinced Twitter s board to hand him the reins on a permanent basis a few months later."

The S&P BSE Sensex advanced 1.6% to 38,895.17, as of 9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, while the NSE Nifty 50 Index also climbed 1.6%. The Sensex plunged 7% last week, its biggest five-day decline in a decade, as a surge in coronavirus cases roiled markets across the world. The relative strength index for the Sensex dropped below 30, a level that indicates the gauge is oversold to some analysts.
The regional MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1%, the most since Feb. 6, after marking its worst slide in 16 months on Friday. Global central banks advocated policy support to coronavirus-hit economies as the death toll topped 3,000.
Strategist View
“Fear of the pandemic will recede only when facts start coming out,” said Umesh Mehta, Mumbai-based head of research at Samco Securities Ltd. “We expect the index to stay volatile with sessions of gains followed by selling as more details on the spread of coronavirus emerge.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The hit to U.S. corporate earnings from the coronavirus epidemic is getting harder and messier to predict. 
Wall Street strategists have been slashing forecasts as the impact from the virus is set to be felt far further than the first quarter, putting 2020 profit growth in jeopardy. A week previous, many market watchers said they expected the virus to affect earnings in the first quarter but not much beyond that.
Worries about the expected impact escalated last week as the virus, which was first detected in China spread rapidly to countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran, causing the S&P 500 (SPX) to suffer its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. In the United States, New York s governor confirmed his state s first positive case on Sunday.
""This is easily going to spill over into the second quarter,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""There isn t a day that goes by now without half a dozen companies expecting some sort of negative effect.""
 Citigroup   equity strategist Tobias Levkovich is forecasting a slight fall year-over-year in 2020 earnings with the impact occurring in the first half of the year as production disruptions emerge and travel is hammered. 
However, if it triggered a global recession, profits could ""decline near 25% and equity markets fall similarly as stocks typically track earnings given past patterns when downturns occurred,"" Levkovich wrote. 
On Thursday, strategists from Goldman Sachs  said they now expect zero profit growth for S&P 500 companies in 2020. 
After a lackluster year of profit growth in 2019, many investors had been hoping earnings this year would be strong enough to support further market gains.
To be sure, part of the recent steep sell-off in stocks has been because of the warnings from companies including market heavyweight Apple Inc .
Wall Street s consensus earnings forecasts, which are based on estimates from analysts who cover individual companies, have come down as well, but mostly not as much as some of the forecasts from the banks.
Howard Silverblatt, analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted that first-quarter profit estimates have declined 5.0% since the end of December, and more declines are expected, as approximately 100 companies have warned.
Based on IBES data from Refinitiv, the 2020 consensus profit forecast from analysts is still well above zero. As of Friday, analysts were expecting earnings growth of 7.6% for 2020, down from an estimate of 9.7% at the start of the year, while for the first quarter, analysts expect a 2.7% gain in earnings versus a year ago, down from 6.3% on Jan. 1, according to Refinitiv s data.
While first-quarter estimates have further to fall as more companies give negative guidance, zero earnings growth for the full year is unlikely, said Nick Raich, chief executive of The Earnings Scout, an independent research firm, anticipating some rebound in corporate results once the spread of the virus slows and demand picks back up.
Many investors noted that the fast-changing outlook for the economy and earnings makes the virus a longer-term issue.

""This is going to be a full-year event,"" Tuz said."
404,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/thinktank-report-on-uighur-labor-in-china-lists-global-brands-2098375,2020-03-02,Think-tank report on Uighur labor in China lists global brands By Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of ethnic Uighurs were moved to work in conditions suggestive of ""forced labor"" in factories across China supplying 83 global brands, an Australian think tank said in a report released on Sunday.
The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) report, which cited government documents and local media reports, identified a network of at least 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces where more than 80,000 Uighurs from the western region of Xinjiang have been transferred.
""Under conditions that strongly suggest forced labor, Uighurs are working in factories that are in the supply chains of at least 83 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei,  Nike , Samsung (KS:005930), Sony and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),"" the think-tank said in the introduction to its report.
The ASPI report said the transfers of labor were part of a state-sponsored program. 
It says the workers ""lead a harsh, segregated life,"" are forbidden to practice religion, and are required to participate in mandarin language classes. 
It also says the Uighurs are tracked electronically and restricted from returning to Xinjiang. 
China s Foreign Ministry on Monday said reports the government had violated the Uighurs  rights were untrue. 
""This report is just following along with the U.S. anti-China forces that try to smear China s anti-terrorism measures in Xinjiang,"" spokesman Zhao Lijian at a regular press briefing on Monday.
The United Nations estimates over a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps in Xinjiang over recent years as part of a wide-reaching campaign by Chinese officials to stamp out terrorism.
The mass detentions have provoked a backlash from rights groups and foreign governments, which say the arbitrary nature of the detentions violates human rights.
China has denied the camps violate the rights of Uighurs and say they are designed to stamp out terrorism and provide vocational skills. 
""Those studying in vocational centers have all graduated and are employed with the help of our government,"" said the Foreign Ministry s Zhao, ""They now live a happy life."" 
The 83 global brands mentioned in ASPI s report either work directly with the factories or source materials from the factories, it said, citing public supplier lists and the factories  own information.
One of the factories, O-Film Technology Co Ltd, which has manufactured cameras for Apple Inc s  iPhones, received 700 Uighur laborers as part of the program in 2017, a local media article cited by the report said.
Apple referred Reuters to an earlier statement that said ""Apple is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. We have not seen this report but we work closely with all our suppliers to ensure our high standards are upheld.""
The other companies mentioned in the introduction to ASPI s report - BMW , Gap Inc  , Huawei Technologies Co Ltd[HWT.UL], Nike Inc , Samsung (SAGR.UL) and Sony Corp (T:6758) did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. 
O-Film Technology did not respond to a request for a comment either. 
Volkswagen told Reuters in a statement that none of the listed companies is a direct supplier. It said the company holds ""direct authority"" in all parts of its business and ""respects minorities, employee representation and social and labor standards."" 
The report said a small number of the brands, including Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N), advised vendors to terminate their relationships with these companies in 2020, and others denied direct contractual relationships with the suppliers. 
ASPI describes itself as an independent think-tank whose core aim is to provide insight for the Australian government on matters of defense, security and strategic policy.

As the coronavirus ricochets around the world, the impact extends way beyond the health implications of an epidemic that has  already killed 3,000 people.
The prospect of coordinated action by central banks and possibly governments may halt the immediate slide in markets, which have suffered the worst rout since the global financial crisis. But underlying economic and political vulnerabilities have been exposed.
China’s manufacturing activity hit a record low in February, risking damage to companies such as Apple  and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) that rely on Chinese production facilities. More broadly, damage to supply chains caused by the virus is fanning concerns from Australia to the U.S. of an over-dependence on China.
In  the political arena, President Donald Trump’s Republican supporters accuse Democrats of stoking fears that could derail the U.S. economy and undermine Trump’s re-election hopes.
From South Korea to Europe, there’s a rush to blame foreigners and to further restrict immigration. Trump tweeted over the weekend that his moves to close the border and curb flights put the U.S. “way ahead in our battle with Coronavirus.”
Panic and political opportunism pose the biggest challenge yet to the interlinked world we live in. Globalization may prove to be just another victim.

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The S&P extended its gains Monday as tech stocks, led by Apple , staged comeback amid signs of a slowdown in infections in China and growing investor bets on global central banks adopting aggressive stimulus measures to cushion the impact on from the coronavirus on economic growth.

The S&P 500 rose 2.44%, the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.71% and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 676 points, or 2.66%.

Following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell s pledge on Friday to support the U.S. economy, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda over the weekend said the central bank would take steps to stabilize financial markets, stoking investor hopes the global central bank stimulus measures would ease the expected to hit growth.
The Bank of England said its was also ready to take action to calm markets.

A 50-basis-point Fed rate cut fully priced in for March, according to Investing.com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Signs the coronavirus spread is slowing in China also helped sentiment.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China reported 206 new cases of Covid-19, on Sunday, the lowest number of new cases since Jan. 22. 

The rebound in the broader sector was underpinned by a rally in tech stocks, with Apple  leading the charge thanks to an upgrade from Wall Street.

Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on Apple  to outperform from perform on expectations that demand for Apple would continue despite uncertain times. Apple) jumped 6%.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares in Apple  surged 6.9% on Monday, helped by a broad Wall Street rebound and an upgraded rating from an analyst who said the iPhone maker s stock had become oversold following last week s rout related to fears about the new coronavirus.
Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on Apple to ""outperform"" from ""perform"", saying the Cupertino, California, company was more prepared than its competitors to absorb the impact of the global health crisis. Apple s stock tumbled over 16% from its record high on Feb. 12 through Friday.
Monday s bounce put Apple s stock on track for its largest one-day gain since December 2018. The company relies heavily on China, where the coronavirus has hit production at its factories and kept consumers away from retail shops.
""Our limited checks indicate Apple will prove more resilient than others as firms worldwide navigate changing supply chains and customer demand uncertainty,"" Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a client note.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), which includes the stocks of many of Apple s suppliers, rebounded 1.9%. U.S. semiconductor companies rely more than most other U.S. companies on China for their sales.

409,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-manufacturing-sector-stalls-as-coronavirus-hits-supply-chains-2099055,2020-03-02,U.S. manufacturing sector stalls as coronavirus hits supply chains By Reuters,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory manufacturing activity slowed in February as new orders contracted, reflecting worries about supply chain disruptions related to the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, which has revived financial market fears of a recession.
While other data on Monday showed construction spending increased by the most in nearly two years, hitting a record high in January, the upbeat news was overshadowed by the coronavirus epidemic. Global stock markets have tumbled, with Wall Street s key indexes suffering their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis last week. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell below 1% for the first time since 2016.
Investors worry the flu-like virus could derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday described the U.S. economy s fundamentals as ""strong,"" but acknowledged that ""the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" and said the U.S. central bank would ""use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.""
""It is more critical than ever for companies to get those supply chain inputs used in production from China, otherwise the manufacturing sector may indeed fall back into a recession,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 50.1 last month from 50.9 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would slip to 50.5 in February.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy.
The ISM index pulled above the 50 threshold in January for the first time in five months, as trade tensions between the United States and China eased following the signing of a partial deal that month. But the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed at least 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000, most of them in China, is a new threat for factories.
Data and some regional Fed factory surveys had hinted at some stabilization in manufacturing after it slumped last year. With manufacturing barely expanding, that could put pressure on the Trump Administration to suspend all U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.
The ISM said ""global supply chains are impacting most, if not all, of the manufacturing industry sectors."" About six industries, including computers and electronics, fabricated metal and chemical producers, reported the coronavirus outbreak was impacting their businesses.
Reports from around the world on Monday also showed factories taking a beating from the coronavirus outbreak, with activity in China shrinking at a record pace. Japan s PMI showed its factory activity was hit by the sharpest contraction in nearly four years in February. In South Korea, factory activity also shrank faster in February.
In addition to fracturing the supply chain and undercutting exports, the outbreak has led to a slowdown in travel plans that is also seen hampering the services industry.
Apple  last month warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first quarter of 2020 and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected.
The ISM s forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 49.8 in February from 52.0 in January. A measure of exports orders fell last month and a gauge of imports tumbled to its lowest level since May 2009. The shortage of raw materials was underscored by a sharp rise in the length of time suppliers are taking to deliver inputs.
""Parts are scarce at an increasing number of companies,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The White House should suspend all Chinese tariffs immediately, it won t do a whole lot of good at this point, but it cannot hurt and President Trump can always re-impose them later.
The ISM s factory employment index remained in contraction territory in February, suggesting manufacturing payrolls could remain weak after declining in December and January.
A separate report on Monday from the data firm IHS Markit showed its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index slid to 50.7 in February from 51.9 in January.
U.S. stock indexes rose on Monday, recouping some of last week s losses, on bargain hunting and hopes that monetary stimulus from central banks would help tide over the potential economic impact of the coronavirus. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher while the dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies.
 MAD DASH 
The ISM said 14 industries reported growth last month, while three contracted. Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said the ""coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the electronics industry,"" adding ""it s a mad dash to dual source stateside in case China isn t back online soon.""
Chemical products manufacturers said the coronavirus and Boeing s  decision to suspend production of its troubled 737 MAX airplane had ""suppressed new orders."" Manufacturers of food, beverage and tobacco products warned of weaker demand for goods made in China as well as ""significant delays to production,"" because of supply bottle necks.
A third report on Monday from the Commerce Department showed construction spending surged 1.8% to a record high of $1.369 trillion as investment in both private and public projects increased.
But economists worried the coronavirus could stunt growth."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Amazon  will on Thursday seek to overturn an EU order to repay about 250 million euros ($277 million) in back taxes to Luxembourg at Europe s second-highest court, one of a series of high-profile cases marking the bloc s crackdown on unfair tax deals. 
The European Commission said in its 2017 ruling that the tax deal, which covered the period from May 2006 to June 2014, meant almost three-quarters of Amazon s business went untaxed.
The EU competition watchdog said the Grand Duchy allowed the U.S. online retailer to shift a significant portion of its profits from a subsidiary to a holding company without paying tax, giving the company an unfair advantage.
At issue was the royalty paid by the subsidiary Amazon EU on certain intellectual property rights to Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, a company which the European Union said had no employees, no offices and no business activities.
Amazon said in its filing to the General Court that the EU had not proven its case, which it claims is riddled with legal and factual errors. The hearing in Luxembourg, of case T-318/18, will run to Friday.
The company said the EU ruling also breached principles of legal certainty, because it relied on a flawed reference framework. 
It accused EU enforcers of discrimination by using 2017 OECD guidelines for a tax deal agreed with Luxembourg in 2003. In addition, Amazon said the EU has no case as the 10-year limitation period has expired.
Apple , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Starbucks  and scores of other multinationals have also been caught in the EU crackdown in recent years over their tax deals with countries in the bloc. 
Starbucks won its fight in September last year after the General Court backed its arguments while Fiat Chrysler lost. Apple is still waiting for a ruling.

Investing.com – Stocks made a bullish start to the week Monday, shrugging off an uptick in coronavirus deaths in the U.S. amid a surge in tech and financials.

The S&P 500 rose 4.6%, the Nasdaq Composite surged 4.5% and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,294 points, or 5.1%. The Dow notched its biggest daily point gain ever, as did the S&P. That is still short of the biggest percentage gain for the Dow of 11.08% and 11.58% for the S&P 500 on Oct. 13, 2008.    
 

Officials in Washington state said Monday four new patients had died from Covid-19, taking the total number of deaths in the U.S. to six.  But with growing bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates aggressively this month, investors piled into stocks, especially in late trading. The major indexes closed at their highs of the session.
A 50-basis-point Fed rate cut is fully priced in for March, according to Investing.com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

In tech, Apple  was the standout as investors cheered an upgrade from Wall Street on the iPhone maker.

Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on Apple  to outperform from perform on expectations that demand for Apple would continue despite uncertain times. Apple) nearly 9%.

While infections continue to mount worldwide, Covid-19 cases in China continued to slow, stoking investor hopes that disruptions to supply chains in the country will be resolved sooner rather than later.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China reported 206 new cases of Covid-19, on Sunday, the lowest number of new cases since Jan. 22. 
Financials, mostly banking stocks, also led the broader market higher,  after catching a bid into the close thanks to a surge in bond yields.

JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs  and Bank of America  rose sharply as the 10-Year Treasury yield rebounded from record lows, rising to 1.157% from lows of 1.03%.
On the economic front, U.S. manufacturing activity remained sluggish as data showed the ISM Manufacturing Index fell to a reading of 50.1 in February, short of economists  estimates of 50.5.   

Elsewhere, Twitter  surged 8% on reports that Elliott Management founder Paul Singer was considering lobbying to replace Twitter chief Jack Dorsey. 
And Costco Wholesale  jumped 10% following virus-scare stockpiling at its stores seen over the weekend.
Nio , however, proved an exception to the rally, closing down 0.7%, after   Citigroup    downgraded the Chinese electric automaker on worries the recent funding deal could prove short-term relief but longer-term pain should sales weakness continue.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  has agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle litigation accusing it of quietly slowing down older iPhones as it launched new models, to induce owners to buy replacement phones or batteries.
The preliminary proposed class-action settlement was disclosed on Friday night and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California.
It calls for Apple to pay consumers $25 per iPhone, which may be adjusted up or down depending on how many iPhones are eligible, with a minimum total payout of $310 million.
Apple denied wrongdoing and settled the nationwide case to avoid the burdens and costs of litigation, court papers show.
The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment.
Friday s settlement covers U.S. owners of the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7Plus or SE that ran the iOS 10.2.1 or later operating system. It also covers U.S. owners of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that ran iOS 11.2 or later before Dec. 21, 2017.
Consumers contended that their phones  performance suffered after they installed Apple software updates. They said this misled them into believing their phones were near the end of their lifecycles, requiring replacements or new batteries.
Apple attributed the problems mainly to temperature changes, high usage and other issues, and said its engineers worked quickly and successfully to address them. Analysts sometimes refer to the slowing of iPhones as ""throttling.""
Lawyers for the consumers described the settlement as ""fair, reasonable, and adequate.""
They called payments of $25 per iPhone ""considerable by any degree,"" saying their damages expert considered $46 per iPhone the maximum possible.
The lawyers plan to seek up to $93 million, equal to 30% of $310 million, in legal fees, plus up to $1.5 million for expenses.
Following an initial outcry over slow iPhones, Apple apologized and lowered the price for replacement batteries to $29 from $79."

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 5% on Monday while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each jumped more than 4% in a major rebound following last week s steep sell-off sparked by fears about the coronavirus.
After the stock market extended gains in the session s final minutes, the Dow wrapped up its strongest one-day gain since 2009, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each had their strongest one-day rise since December 2018.
That rally followed the U.S. stock market s worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, sinking into correction territory on Thursday due to fears of a recession resulting from the epidemic.
The S&P 500 remains down 8.7% from its Feb. 19 record high close. Many investors will consider the index to remain in a correction until it reclaims its high.
Apple  jumped 9.3% in its largest one-session leap since 2008. The iPhone maker is still down nearly 9% from its record high close on Feb. 12.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that Japan s central bank would take necessary steps to stabilize financial markets. That followed a similar move by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Friday.
""We can shrug off an economic downturn, but if it starts to spill into companies  capacity to pay their debts, then that creates deeper problems. But it seems to me like the central banks are linking arms to find a way to insulate the credit markets from economic uncertainty,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) warned revenue would drop 15% in businesses including consumer electronics and enterprise products in the first quarter, but that it would recover thereafter as production returns to normal in virus-hit China.
Foxconn is among manufacturers worldwide who are grappling with virus-related curbs that have upended supply chains and hurt demand. Apple, its top client, rescinded its March quarter sales guidance citing a slower ramp up of manufacturing in China amid travel restrictions and an extended Lunar New Year break. 
The Taiwanese firm, which assembles Apple s  iPhones, said it does not expect to see any revenue growth in the first half and a ""mild downward revision"" from original guidance of ""slight growth"" for the year due to the coronavirus. 
While it did not give any details, Foxconn noted the virus  impact would be short term and that so far the effect on its supply chain was ""not that great"".
""Prevention of outbreak, resumption of work and production are our top priority,"" Chairman Liu Young-Way told an online investor conference on Tuesday.
Overall manufacturing activity has been hobbled in China by travel curbs and quarantine requirements aimed at containing the coronavirus which can be transmitted from person to person.
The flu-like virus, which originated in China, has spread to over 60 countries. It has infected more than 86,000 people and killed over 3,000 people, the majority in China.
Foxconn, however, sought to allay investor concerns about the virus  impact, saying it expects to resume normal production in China, its top manufacturing base, by the end of the March.
The company s ""long-term cooperation"" with suppliers will also help provide a cushion against the rise in prices of some components, Chairman Liu said.
APPLE OUTLOOK
Any disruption at Foxconn, formally called  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, would cloud Apple s timeline for new phones.
Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new iPhones as its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts say, but the timeline could be threatened by travel curbs.
Apple engineers usually jet off to Asia in the first few months of the year to perfect the production of new models, former employees and supply chain experts said.
Liu said it has not seen ""great impact"" on clients  new product launches, pointing to its advanced assembly capacity.
Foxconn s Apple operations are housed under its consumer electronics business that accounts for more than half its revenue. Its enterprise products business includes servers and telecommunication products.

Foxconn shares have dropped more than 10% this year."

Investing.com -- The G7 is holding a conference call about the coronavirus, while the global rebound in risk assets continues, without being fully convincing. Oil gains sharply as  OPEC+  ministers descend on Vienna to discuss further output cuts - and it s Super Tuesday in the race for the Democratic Party s presidential nomination. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, March 3rd.  
1. G7 talks virus
World markets are holding their breath to see what the G7 – a body that has done its best to make itself irrelevant in recent years with its own divisions – can deliver in the way of coordinated economic policy support in the face of the spreading coronavirus.
Newswire reports suggest finance ministers and central bank governors will hold a conference call on the subject at 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), following on from a string of individual statements by the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, ECB and Bank of England, all committing themselves to keeping financial markets orderly and taking “appropriate” action to support the economy.  
According to Reuters, the draft communique from the call did not mention concrete or coordinated measures. However, there was action overnight from the Reserve Bank of Australia, which cut its key rate to a new record low of 0.5%, and its Malaysian counterpart, which also cut by 25 basis points to 2.50%.
2. Global bounce in risk assets continues
The sharp rally in U.S. equity markets on Monday was followed overnight by gains in Asian and European stocks, despite lingering concerns that looser monetary policy – expectations for which were chiefly responsible for the bounce – will be of limited use in fighting the virus.

China’s main stock indices rose by between 0.5% and 0.9%, while Europe’s bourses rebounded more vigorously – the benchmark Stoxx 600 gained 2.2%. In all cases, this represents little more than a return from levels that appeared deeply oversold in the short term.
In commodity markets, U.S. crude futures rebounded nearly 4% to $48.51 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 3.3% to $53.63, on hopes both for monetary stimulus and for an additional cut in output of as much as 1 million barrels a day from OPEC and its allies. Minister are flying into Vienna on Tuesday ahead of a meeting scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday.
3. U.S. stocks set to open higher
The rebound in U.S. stocks is set to continue at the opening, in the absence of fresh shocks on the coronavirus front.

By 6:35 AM ET (1135 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was up 183 points or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.8%. The Dow future is now 9.7% below its pre-outbreak peak. However, credit spreads remain under pressure, suggesting that there is still plenty of skepticism as regards the sustainability of the recovery.
The virus continues to spread across the U.S., however, with the state of Georgia reporting its first two cases and the overall number of confirmed cases rising to 105. The U.S. death toll remains at six, of which five were in the same care home in Seattle, Wa.
The mood is being improved by increased signs of a return to normal levels of economic activity in China. Hon Hai Precision, which assembles the iPhone for Apple , said it expects “normal” working conditions at its Chinese factories to be resumed by the end of March.
4. Mester, Evans to add to rate chatter

The data calendar for Tuesday is relatively light, with appearances by Fed officials Loretta Mester and Charles Evans likely to spark more interest than either vehicle sales numbers or the Institute of Supply Management’s New York Business Conditions index.

In the same vein, the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly update on U.S. oil supplies is likely to be overshadowed by newswire updates out of Vienna ahead of the ‘OPEC+’ meeting.

Earlier, the euro zone’s consumer price index remained stuck at 1.2% in February, with the core index surprisingly ticking up to the same rate. The euro zone’s jobless rate remained at a 10-year low of 7.4%.

The U.K.’s construction PMI, meanwhile, rose to a 13-month high of 52.6, a development that was all but lost in the noise around the coronavirus outbreak.
 5. Super Tuesday for the Democrats
The race for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination reaches a critical stage, as voters in 14 states – including the key states of California and Texas -- head to the polls in Super Tuesday.
The field has essentially narrowed to four candidates after Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig both withdrew and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned lower again on Tuesday, after the disappointment of a G7 conference call that stopped short of announcing concrete measures to support the global economy as it struggles with the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
The G7 statement was strong on principle but short on detail, saying: “finance ministers are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy during this phase. G7 central banks will continue to fulfil their mandates, thus supporting price stability and economic growth while maintaining the resilience of the financial system.”
Markets had entertained – arguably unrealistic – hopes of immediate measures to deal with what is a shock to both supply and demand across the world economy.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 225 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 contract was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
Among individual companies, Apple  stock fell 0.6%, reversing an early gain after its biggest manufacturing contractor Hon Hai Precision said it expected its Chinese factories to be working roughly as normal by the end of March.
Apple  had cited supply chain constraints at its Chinese factories as one of two factors for its warning in February that it would not meet its sales targets in the current quarter.
Qiagen stock was up 15.2% at its highest since early December after Thermo Fisher agreed to buy the diagnostics group for $11.5 billion. Qiagen is, among other things, developing kits to test for the Covid-19 virus.
Thermo Fisher stock opened up 4.4% but pared gains to be up 3.7%.
  Target    stock was up 1.0% after the retailer reported adjusted earnings per share up 10.6% from a year earlier in the final quarter of 2019 – some 2.5% ahead of expectations.  
For 2020,  Target   said it expects a low-single digit increase in comparable sales and a mid-single digit increase in operating income."

The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency interest-rate cut, and the Group of Seven finance chiefs pledged to use all policy tools to support the global economy.
Australia cut rates to a record low and U.S. President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to “ease and cut rate big.” Malaysia reduced its benchmark interest rate while the Fed, Bank of Japan and European Central Bank all pledged to act.
Infections rose again in South Korea and Iran, where more officials were diagnosed. Businesses in the U.K., which has reported 51 cases, were warned that as many as a fifth of workers could be forced off sick if the country is hit by a widespread outbreak. Japan’s tally of cases approached the 1,000 mark, while Spain’s rose 32% to 150. The International Olympic Committee urged athletes to keep preparing for the Tokyo games amid concern the outbreak could quash that event.
U.S. stocks declined and Treasuries surged as investors worried the Fed’s emergency cut won’t be enough to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus.

WHO: Not Time to Wave a White Flag (12:15 p.m. NY)
The head of the World Health Organization said countries shouldn’t be “waving a white flag” and should pursue aggressive containment strategies, even if they have no or few cases of the novel coronavirus.
China has managed to steadily reduce the number of new cases, which dropped to the lowest number since Jan. 20, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the group’s daily briefing in Geneva Tuesday.
In some people the coronavirus can cause much more serious illness than influenza, even if it doesn’t spread as easily, Tedros said. Producers of medical gear need to boost supply 40% because each month the world will need 89 million medical masks, 76 million exam gloves and 1.6 million goggles, he said.
Iran, the center of the outbreak in the Middle East, is in need of medical equipment including ventilators, and the large increases in new cases are a reflection of how medical authorities are being more aggressive in trying to detect the virus, Tedros said. “Things tend to look worse before they get better.”
FDA on Watch for Drug Shortages From India (11:10 a.m. NY)
U.S. health regulators are watching for potential drug shortages after India restricted the export of some raw pharmaceutical ingredients, a move that has potential to disrupt the global supply chain of drugs manufactured around the world.
Earlier Tuesday, India said it would limit export of some common medicines as concerns grow over shortages of chemical ingredients. Many manufacturers in China are shut due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Though India is the source of about 20% of the world’s generic-drug supply, the country is dependent on China for about 66% of the chemical components needed to make them. India wants to ensure that there are enough supplies at home for its citizens.
Homeland Security Closes Field Office in Seattle (10:37 a.m. NY)

“The employee had been coming to work in the intervening days between the possible exposure (Feb. 22) and becoming ill (Feb. 26). In an effort to contain the threat of potential spread & out of an abundance of caution, the @USCIS Seattle Field Office was ordered closed,” Cuccinelli tweeted.
Fed Cuts Rates Half Point in Emergency Move (10:20 a.m. NY)
The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency half-percentage point interest rate cut Tuesday in a bid to protect the longest-ever economic expansion.

N.Y. Man in Westchester Tests Positive, Cuomo Says (9:40 a.m. NY)
A 50-year-old man who works in Manhattan and lives in the New York suburb of Westchester County has been hospitalized and tested positive for the coronavirus.
The man doesn’t have a history of foreign travel and it wasn’t immediately clear if he’d had contact with known cases in the U.S. Health authorities around the country are closely watching for coronavirus cases with unknown origins, a sign that the virus could be spreading from person-to-person.
The man lives in Westchester with his family. A school in the Bronx attended by one of his children has been closed as a precaution, Cuomo said.
There are also two families in Buffalo that are suspected of having the virus, the governor’s office said in an email.
New York City has at least one confirmed case so far, a Manhattan woman in her 30s who contracted the virus while traveling in Iran. She was isolated in her Manhattan apartment as of last weekend.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also said he wants G7 message to be “as powerful as possible.” Le Maire said he’s in close contact with G7 counterparts and spoke with ECB President Lagarde on Tuesday. “I can assure that you at the level of the G7 and the eurozone we will have a coordinated, strong and fast response to this crisis,” he said.
Under pressure from investors to match recent pledges of economic support with concrete action, G-7 finance ministers and central bankers including Carney and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, will discuss their virus response at about 7 a.m. Washington time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There are signs the escalating coronavirus outbreak has begun to weigh on business sentiment in the United States, a report by the Federal Reserve released on Wednesday showed, even as the U.S. economy expanded at a modest to moderate pace over the past several weeks.
The Fed cut interest rates by a half percentage point on Tuesday in an emergency move to mitigate the possible economic effects of the flu-like illness on the world s largest economy, as it kept the door open to further measures should they be required.
It was the Fed s first emergency rate cut since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis and underscored its concern about the escalating global outbreak.
The Fed frequently surveys its business contacts around the country and the latest temperature check of the economy analyzed the period through most of February. 
During that time the virus had spread from China to more than 40 countries, causing financial markets to tumble amid fears the escalating crisis could cause a global slowdown. 
""The coronavirus was negatively impacting travel and tourism in the U.S....some supply chain delays were reported as a result of the coronavirus and several districts said that producers feared further disruptions over the coming weeks,"" according to the report, in which the coronavirus was mentioned 48 times. 
The Fed uses the survey, compiled into a report known as the Beige Book, as ground-level intelligence on the economic outlook for the months ahead as business sentiment often front-runs changes in hard economic data.
Districts reported their outlook for the near-term was mostly for modest economic growth, with the coronavirus and the upcoming U.S. presidential election cited as potential risks.
On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a hastily arranged press conference that the effects of the virus on the U.S. economy ""are at a very early stage but you are hearing concerns from people, for example in the travel business or the hotel business..."" and that it was one of the reasons the Fed felt they needed to take swift action by cutting rates.
The aviation and tourism industries in the United States have been hit as businesses globally restrict travel, send workers home and cancel conferences.
Apple  last month warned it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for this quarter due to constraints on global iPhone supplies as production in manufacturing plants in China had been suspended, while a report earlier this week showed factory activity in China shrinking at a record pace. 
In the Beige Book, the picture was mixed on the impact of the coronavirus so far, reflecting the fact that any economic effects are set to intensify the longer the outbreak is not contained.
The New York Fed district, for example, said ""a few contacts reported that the coronavirus has deterred visitors, though New York City hotels have continued to report good business"" while the Dallas Fed reported ""several contacts"" said the coronavirus was impacting their supply chain, particularly in high-tech and chemical manufacturing.
In the Atlanta region, transportation firms said canceled flights to China had reduced air cargo capacity significantly, threatening first-quarter revenues.
Overall, the virus has had little impact so far on U.S. economic data, with consumers still spending and unemployment near a 50-year low. There were few signs yet of that abating, according to the Fed s report, which noted a pick-up in consumer spending and hiring constrained by a tight labor market.
Earlier on Wednesday, data showed U.S. services sector activity accelerated to a one-year high in February.

By Geoffrey Smith 

Investing.com -- European stock markets quickly lost early gains on Thursday, as the widening impact of the coronavirus on public life in the short term muted optimism about stimulus measures coming down the line.
By 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was flat at 386.27 points. The German DAX was down 0.3% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.8%.
Strong gains overnight in the U.S. and Asia were quickly forgotten as companies ranging from TV broadcasters to auto suppliers and fashion houses warned of substantial hits to their business this year from the disease. 

Auto components group Continental  said it expected margins this year to be a full percentage point below consensus forecasts due to demand weakness tied to the outbreak, while German fashion chain   Hugo Boss   (DE:BOSSn) said it doesn’t expect business to return to normal before the middle of the year.
U.K. broadcaster   ITV    meanwhile said it expected a 10% drop in advertising revenue in April, a consequence of travel companies tightening their purse strings in the face of collapsing demand.
Those warnings followed on the heels of increasingly drastic measures in Europe to stop the spread of the virus, notably Italy s decision on Wednesday to close its schools for two weeks and ban spectators from major sporting events. "

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is planning to backstop its growing electronics sector by arranging to airlift components from China, three government officials said, as it tries to contain the fallout from the coronavirus crisis in China.
India s federal technology ministry has asked electronics and smartphone industry lobby groups to draw up a list of components made in China which then can be airlifted, two of the officials said. China is slowly getting back to work after an extended shutdown, but it is still grappling with a range of production and logistics delays.
Electronics manufacturing, especially the assembly of smartphones, is a bright spot for India s otherwise flagging economy. But the country is still highly dependent on China for components such as camera modules and display screens.
The emergency airlift plans underscore the interconnected nature of global supply chains and the continued dependence on China for key goods even as some manufacturers - prompted in some cases by the U.S.-China trade war - move to build up capacity outside of China.
Other industries are also exploring airfreight options.
The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India has reached out to its members to assess which parts are in short supply and can potentially be air-lifted, according to a source aware of the matter. India s auto industry relies heavily on China for parts such as electronic components, pressure sensors and fuel injectors.
India s embassy in China is also helping coordinate an airlift of drug ingredients from China, said a government adviser with direct knowledge of the matter.
For the electronics and smartphone components, the technology ministry ""is in touch with aviation carriers and air freighters and they ve been connected with the industry,"" one of the government sources said.
The airlifting of components from the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shanghai is one option being discussed, the official said.
The sources did not say when the airlifting might begin. The aviation ministry did not immediately respond a request for comment.
Lack of truck drivers, a proliferation of road checkpoints and a shortage of workers at Chinese ports have slowed shipments even for parts that are still being produced, Reuters has reported. Air cargo firms have also reduced services in response to crew health concerns and uncertain demand.
China is India s biggest trading partner, but India s imports of Chinese goods contracted in February to their lowest levels in nearly four years, trade ministry data reviewed by Reuters showed.
SCRAMBLING IN INDIA
Smartphone makers in India thus far have largely weathered the virus crisis, partly because they had built up inventories of Chinese-made parts to cover the Lunar New Year holiday period when China s factories close down.
But those stocks could dry up soon. S.N. Rai, the co-founder of homegrown smartphone maker Lava, said the supply of some components had resumed, but the pace of production at his factory on the outskirts of New Delhi could soon slow down.
""The period between March 10 and March 20 is going to be very tough,"" Rai told Reuters. ""In the absence of supplies, we might have to cut one or two of the three eight-hour shifts we have daily.""
Others are scrambling for components too.
The India units of contract manufacturers  Wistron Corp  (TW:3231), which makes some of Apple Inc s  lower-priced iPhones, and Flex Ltd  have, through an industry body, asked for government help in securing components including camera modules and displays from China, according to two industry sources.
Wistron and Flex did not immediately respond to Reuters  requests for comment."

Seattle in Washington state has been most affected by the virus in the United States. Ten people have died out of 39 cases of infections through community transmission of the virus.
Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle, recommended employees in the area to work from home through the end of the month, after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday.
The employee worked at Amazon s South Lake Union office complex in Seattle. Two other company employees in Milan, Italy, were also infected. 
Facebook said on Thursday a contractor at its Seattle office was diagnosed with the coronavirus and that it would shut the location until March 9.
""A contractor based in our Stadium East office has been diagnosed with the COVID-19,"" a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
The companies  work from home recommendation will affect more than 100,000 people in the Seattle area, as both Microsoft and Amazon employ over 50,000 each. Facebook has more than 5,000 employees in the area. 
Seattle health authorities have urged https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/california-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus-as-death-toll-rises-in-us-idUSKBN20R28H companies to allow their employees to work from home as much as possible, stagger shifts to ease commuter congestion on public transportation and avoid large work-related gatherings.
The epidemic has shown no signs of slowing, with deaths mounting globally. It has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, mostly in China, where it originated in December. 
Big tech companies have also been dropping out of several conferences and calling off corporate events as the virus spreads. Apple  and Netflix  on Wednesday dropped out of SXSW conference to be held later this month, citing virus concerns.

Microsoft said on Wednesday that some ""essential"" employees should continue to go to their work locations and that the company would follow government guidelines for disinfecting its sites for essential personnel. "

SEOUL (Reuters) - For one South Korean multinational company that makes smartphone components used by Apple Inc  and  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570), the coronavirus epidemic is dealing blow after blow.
First, the initial outbreak forced its China factory to shut down for almost three weeks and caused supplies from China for its Vietnam plant to begin to dry up. Then when the virus spread to South Korea, travel restrictions prevented its workers from keeping an expansion at the plant, located in the port city of Hai Phong, on track.
Now the company, which declined to be named to protect business relationships, is looking at disruptions in its factory in the industrial hub of Gumi, less than an hour s drive from Daegu, the epicenter of South Korea s coronavirus cases.
In addition to continued difficulties with sourcing from China, the supplier of smartphone screen parts and camera modules to LG firms has been hit by some worker quarantines and is fretting about the prospect of even more - problems likely to ripple through to end customers including Apple.
""The virus has a domino effect on suppliers,"" a senior executive at the firm told Reuters. ""I just look up to the sky and sigh."" 
Its woes illustrate how the coronavirus crisis has shaken an Asian electronics supply chain still smarting from the U.S.-China trade war and the integral role played by China s ecosystem of factories. The problems also expose how Korea Inc s strategy of investing heavily in Vietnam has not proven to be a fully successful hedge against risks in China.
Led by national champions LG and Samsung, Korean companies have been building their presence in Vietnam for years as the costs of manufacturing in China rose along with political risks and concerns about intellectual property theft.
While China remains the best source for many parts and materials and is the base for major Chinese tech companies and big customers like Apple, Vietnam s proximity made it an obvious choice for offsetting risk.
Korean firms are the biggest foreign investors in Vietnam, with over 4,000 operating in the country. Interdependence runs deep: Samsung alone accounts for one-fourth of Vietnam s exports and the Southeast Asian nation is South Korea s No. 3 export market as well as the fifth-biggest source of Korean imports. 
(GRAPHIC: Vietnam s top 10 foreign investors - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-VIETNAM-SOUTHKOREA/0H001R8ENC5T/eikon.png) 
Business is facilitated by a huge amount of travel. There were some 3.5 million arrivals from Korea in Vietnam in 2018, a 44% jump from a year earlier. South Korean and Vietnamese airlines flew routes between the two countries 538 times a week last year.
So when Vietnam began curtailing travel links, business plans went awry. Most flights between the two nations are currently suspended and starting Sunday, South Koreans entering Vietnam will have to undergo 14 days quarantine.
""We are having a tough time, because we can t work there,"" said the chief executive of a different supplier to LG, which also declined to be named. 
The company, which makes automation equipment for car navigation systems used by Honda Motor Co (T:7267), BMW  and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and is also based in Gumi, is worried it will have to delay the installation of gear because it can t send engineers to Vietnam.
""Should the crisis last two and three months, that will cause serious problems,"" the CEO said.
The personal presence of engineers to guide technology improvement and manage quality control can be crucial. 
""Managers can do video conferences, but production engineers have to go there for problem solving,"" said Park Ho-hwan, a business school professor at Ajou University who has studied Samsung s operations in Korea and Vietnam.

APPLE TAKES NOTICE
Two weeks ago, the biggest virus-related concern for Korean tech firms was keeping their Vietnam factories running. While Vietnam has reported very few COVID-19 cases, it moved quickly to close its border with China, blocking key supplies.
Samsung, for one, quickly scrambled to address logistics problems, including using air freight for urgent cargo instead of land routes, several people familiar with the operations told Reuters.
Those problems eased, but the virus explosion in South Korea, which now has more than 6,000 cases, poses an even bigger threat if swathes of workers are quarantined and factories are put on hiatus. 
In recent weeks,  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) temporarily suspended production at its smartphone factory in Gumi, while LG Display and LG Innotek also halted work for a few days.
Such is Samsung s concern, it has advised workers to refrain from weekend outings with family and friends, asked them to wear masks and maintain a distance of more than 2 meters when talking to each other.
""We are making our best effort to minimize the impact on our operations,"" Samsung said in a statement.
Apple, which buys displays from LG Display, camera modules from LG Innotek and products including memory chips and displays from Samsung, has taken notice.
""I think the focus in the last few days has (turned) off of China on to Korea and Italy, so I think it s very important to see what happens there and whether something new comes out of that,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said an interview with Fox News last week.

""Our supply chain is relatively more important in China, but we have great businesses in Korea and we have suppliers in Korea as well and suppliers in Italy and great business there as well. We need to see as that unfolds."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uncertainty over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak has prompted at least some winners of the U.S. Lipper Fund Awards to look for companies that can withstand a prolonged pullback. 
U.S. stocks are down sharply from the record highs they reached in late February as companies ranging from Apple Inc  to Tesla Inc  warn investors their supply chains and revenues could be derailed by the rapidly spreading virus known as COVID-19. 
As a result, fund managers from firms including  Wells Fargo  , GMO, Madison Investors and Needham & Company say they are looking at companies in the healthcare, technology and financial services sectors which could continue to gain market share regardless of any economic disruptions from the outbreak.
""We felt that we were due for a correction, we just didn t know what would trigger it, and when it would begin,"" said Chris Retzler, portfolio manager of the Needham Small Cap Growth fund. 
""I don t know how low we go and how long we stay there, but I still remain firmly of the belief that we are in a bull market,"" said Retzler, adding that he was actively adding to companies during the market sell-off.
Retzler is focusing his portfolio on companies that can benefit from the growth of 5G communications, military modernization and data security, among other areas.
He also remains bullish on healthcare companies, which saw share prices decline earlier this year on concerns that Bernie Sanders, a self-avowed democratic socialist senator from Vermont, could win the Democratic presidential nomination and push a Medicare for All plan. 
""We have healthcare investments where we think that names are misunderstood, and we think the opportunities are great but are taking a little bit longer to excite investors,"" Retzler said. 
Mike Smith, portfolio manager of the Wells Fargo Endeavor Select fund, said he reserves a portion of his portfolio to focus on companies with compelling valuations and has been more active in the last week about adding to healthcare and technology names. 
Among the more recent additions to his portfolio is  DexCom  Inc , a medical device company that makes continuous monitoring devices for patients with diabetes. Shares of the company are up nearly 32% for the year to date through March 5, while the broad S&P 500 is down slightly more than 5% over the same time. 
""We re trying to find those companies that are impervious to what s going on right now,"" Smith said. 
Matt Hayner, portfolio manager of the Madison Investors fund, began buying shares of Becton Dickinson and Co , a maker of medical supplies and devices, in January. The company, whose shares have dropped about 11% year to date, now represents about 4% of Hayner s portfolio.
""Even in the face of economic disruption, people will still need healthcare and maybe even more so with a disease traversing the globe that ultimately hospitalizes people,"" he said. 
NEW  QUALITY  STOCKS
The annual Lipper Fund Awards granted by Refinitiv, formerly the financial and risk business of Thomson Reuters, recognize the top funds and fund management firms in more than 20 countries based on risk-adjusted returns. Winners were announced on March 5 in New York. 
The market risks from the coronavirus outbreak should ""burn themselves out"" within the next two quarters, setting up a rebound in the shares of companies that have seen sharp declines, said Tom Hancock, portfolio manager of the GMO Quality fund. 
Hancock added a new position in a healthcare company to his portfolio last week and built up a new position in ride-hailing firm  Lyft  Inc  over the last two quarters after the company s ""broken"" initial public offering left its shares trading at an attractive valuation, he said. 
Hancock is now focused on companies that can grow regardless of the economic impact of the coronavirus, he said. 
""We still have concerns that are stopping us from going out and buying absolutely everything,"" Hancock said.
He said he was focusing on giant technology companies like Google-parent Alphabet Inc  and Apple Inc which have what he called ""natural monopolies."" Shares of both companies are down about 5% over the last month. 

""If you say high quality stocks, people think of names like Procter and Gamble and  Pfizer  ,"" Hancock said. ""But we think the new quality stocks are the technology stocks that have very low capital requirements and operate winner-take-all business models."""

LA RINCONADA, Peru (Reuters) - From the Andes mountains, thousands of artisanal gold-diggers for years sent fragments of metal to a Swiss valley. There, a refinery purified the gold to sell to banks, watchmakers, fine jewelers and electronics companies. It circulated as ingots, phones and trinkets - some branded with names including Apple and Tiffany & Co .
A trade worth billions of dollars, it was championed by the Swiss refinery, Metalor Technologies, as part of a program with Peru s government to integrate gold prospectors into the economy.
In early 2018, Metalor stopped taking the gold. The reason: It couldn t be sure where the metal came from. Peruvian prosecutors had come to suspect Metalor s main supplier was a front used by criminals to filter illegally produced gold into the world market.
Metalor is not under investigation in Peru, and there is no suggestion of illegality by the refiner. But the story of the project - and of how it was monitored by the companies and regulators involved - illustrates the risks of illicit commerce that lie beneath gold s glamor. 
Peruvian authorities are exploring criminal charges against Metalor s supplier, a trading firm named Minerales del Sur, after seizing a cargo worth nearly $4 million destined for Metalor in 2018, prosecutorial and customs documents seen by Reuters show. Customs inspectors found some participants in the program were selling more gold than they could produce, according to customs reports. The prosecutors allege these inflated volumes suggest Minerales del Sur was a cover to launder metal from illegal sources, such as mines financed by narcotics dealers or in banned sites in the Amazon  rainforest.
Minerales del Sur, which declined to comment for this article, has told Peruvian authorities it obtained gold legally.
BULLETS THROUGH THE HEAD
As global hunger for gold accelerates, so too do problems in its production. 
Industrial mines have long been accused of depriving indigenous people of land, polluting their homes and breeding crime. Now, high gold prices are making it attractive for individuals to try what the industry calls artisanal and small-scale mining. Every year around 500 tonnes, worth $25 billion at current prices, of gold is dug in this way, according to industry estimates - 15% of all the gold that is mined. 
Metalor is one of at least five major refineries, including two in the United States, which have come under legal scrutiny in the last two decades after taking artisanal gold from countries including Colombia and Peru, where most of the world s cocaine is produced and narcotics gangs have invested in gold production. One U.S. refinery closed after its employees were jailed for trading illegal and smuggled gold. 
This Metalor program was supposed to be part of the solution - a state-backed scheme to bring informal diggers into the formal market and improve their conditions. 
Minerales del Sur was hired to collect and check gold from small miners across the highland region of Puno, which extends from the fringes of the Amazon to Lake Titicaca. The region s apex, and the source of some of the gold, is a shantytown of about 50,000 people located 16,700 feet above sea-level. Called La Rinconada, it sits below a glacier-capped mountain known as La Bella Durmiente, or Sleeping Beauty. 
Said to be the highest permanent human settlement in the world, La Rinconada is no fairytale. Last year, authorities reported rescuing at least 68 trafficking victims from the shantytown s nightclubs. Last April, seven gold miners were found in a tunnel beneath the mountain with bullets through the head. 
Media organizations and NGOs repeatedly published reports that Metalor s Peruvian gold suppliers may have been infiltrated by criminals. The Swiss company - which prosecutors estimated processed about 106 tonnes of gold worth $3.5 billion from Minerales del Sur since 2001 - said it was confident of the checks it imposed on its suppliers.
""To our knowledge, we believe that this was done in a proper way,"" said Metalor CEO Antoine de Montmollin. ""But due to the complexity of the supply chain, we cannot have 100% certainty. We await the conclusion of the current investigation."" 
In 2018, Metalor supplied gold to firms including Tiffany & Co., Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and Apple Inc . Gold is used to conduct electricity in phones and other electronic devices.
Apple said it is committed to setting the highest standards for responsible sourcing, and has stopped working with 60 gold refiners since 2015 because they were unable or unwilling to meet its standards. It declined comment on whether it continued to accept gold from Metalor. 
Tiffany said it upheld industry-leading standards aligned with its commitment to responsible sourcing. It said Metalor was among several refiners which provided gold used in non-jewelry items. Its website shows these include $375 golden drinking straws and $1,500 paper-clips.
Samsung declined to comment. 
Metalor said its executives and local staff made dozens of visits, including to Minerales del Sur s offices, to ensure suppliers were operating legally. Each time gold was shipped, it also verified documentation to ensure the metal came only from members of the state formalization program. 
But Metalor told Reuters it did not inspect mines. And its executives were not aware of two independent audit reports, produced for a Peruvian state firm involved in the program and seen by Reuters, that found flaws which made it easy for gold from unknown sources to be slipped into shipments.
Peruvian prosecutors have said their investigation will remain open in a preliminary phase through 2020. No charges have been issued, and the case may be closed if not enough evidence is assembled.
Peru s Energy and Mining Ministry said it was working on improvements to the program, which it said has helped hundreds of thousands of people. In 2014, the incomes of as many as 600,000 people in Peru depended on artisanal and small-scale mining, according to estimates accessed on Delve, a global platform for information on such mines.
""You re not going to find any country where traceability of small-scale mining is 100% trustworthy,"" Lenin Valencia, director of mining formalization in the ministry, told Reuters. Small-scale mining is so important to society and the economy that compromises have to be made, he said. ""If we stuck to the law, there probably wouldn t be enough jails in the country to imprison so many people.""
Minerales del Sur declined to comment. A company representative told a judge in Lima its gold was all sourced legally. Daniel Jo Villalobos, attorney for Minerales owner Francisco Quintano Mendez, did not respond to emails. 
Metalor has been owned since 2016 by Japan s biggest gold retailer, Tanaka Kikinzoku, which said it had nothing to add.
A COMPLICATED PLACE
Peru is the biggest gold producer in Latin America. Its illegal gold trade, worth an estimated $4.38 billion in 2015, is at least twice as big an industry as drug trafficking, according to a 2017 report by the Peruvian banking regulator s Financial Investigation Unit. 
Energy and Mines Ministry data shows Peru s small-scale miners produced almost 19 tonnes of gold in 2018 - more than any single industrial mine in the country. Just over a third of its informal gold production that year was recorded in Puno, the region that was supplying Metalor. 
More than one in three people live in poverty in Puno, a land of rocks shot through with gold. Since 2000, rising gold prices have lured more to try their luck - in riverbeds, the rainforest, and in tunnels dug so haphazardly they risk collapse. 
To extract the metal, some use toxins including mercury which they sluice into waters such as Lake Titicaca, where studies have documented high levels of heavy metals in fish. On satellite maps, pools near mining areas show up sulphurous yellow and neon green. 
Miners in La Rinconada melt ice from the glacier to process ore. Yellow plastic bags of garbage slide uncollected down the snowy slopes; raw sewage collects in the hollows. The main drag bristles with black-market pop-up stalls marked ""Compro Oro"" (""I Buy Gold"") where men and women sell specks of metal. 
Metalor s supplier Minerales del Sur had two gold-buying outlets in La Rinconada. Its headquarters in the town of Juliaca were shuttered when a reporter visited in June. A man who answered the door said the company was no longer operating. 
Metalor showed Reuters data from its suppliers in the last four weeks it took gold from the Peruvian program. Almost one-third of the nearly $30 million worth of gold sent to the refinery in Switzerland over those four weeks came from suppliers who were identified in the Peruvian prosecutorial documents as ""suspicious,"" based on customs inspectors  findings. 
La Rinconada produced only a small share, according to the records. It s hard to be sure of the provenance: Customs inspectors found some of the names on the list were not producing gold where they said.
For example, in March 2018, Metalor accepted more than 40 kilos of gold (worth about $1.7 million) from a company outside La Rinconada which customs officials said in a report later that year they couldn t find at the address listed. When the inspectors phoned, the person they reached told them the firm was currently ""at the investment stage,"" the report said. 
Last June, a Reuters reporter in La Rinconada watched as hundreds of police officers in riot gear swept through the shantytown. A court had ordered miners out of ground owned by a local family. 
But the miners refused to move. They massed into a blockade and set off explosions of the dynamite they use to split the rocks. After a two-hour standoff, the police left. 
""La Rinconada is a very complicated place,"" said Federico Chavarry, who has spent the past decade as an environmental crimes prosecutor in Puno. He said the state lacks the resources to rein in illegal trade in the shantytown, because it makes so much money for many people.
""I think it spun out of the government s hands a long time ago."" 
Valencia at the mining ministry said prosecutors should be more active in controlling organized crime that fuels abuses. ""Right now, we don t just have informal economies, we have criminal economies,"" he said.
In one of two health clinics in the shantytown, physician Nelson Gadea, who has lived there for seven years, said that when he arrived he was shocked by the violence. The mercury the miners use causes mood swings, he said, flipping through pictures on his cellphone of patients disfigured by knife wounds: ""I don t go out after 6pm.""
Men offer lighted cigarettes and coca leaves to the mountain spirits to win their favor. Women, barred by the men from the mines, scavenge on mountains of scree. 
The men ""bring the rocks, dump them and we recycle the gold they didn t see,"" said one scavenger, Carmen Inofuente.
""There ve been a lot of accidents, rocks fall on us, there have been deaths, too.""
There is no question that conditions in La Rinconada are very difficult, Metalor said; its aim had been to help. 
WATCH VALLEY
From the Andes to Metalor s headquarters is more than 6,000 miles and a world of contrast.
With views of the Jura Mountains, Metalor s neat lab and offices in Marin-Epagnier, a village at the tip of Lake Neuchatel, sit in ""Watch Valley,"" at the heart of Switzerland s watchmaking industry. The country exported timepieces worth more than $21 billion in 2018: One in every three watches shipped out of Switzerland is made of precious metal. 
In a conference room in Metalor s headquarters, CEO de Montmollin - who joined in 2005 and has been running the company since January 2019 - said artisanal gold had made up less than 5% of its annual throughput. Projects to make artisanal gold easier to trace face challenges, he said. 
Metalor refines roughly 500 tonnes of gold a year, around one-tenth of the total handled by the main global refineries. To be certain metal has been fairly produced often demands working with small quantities from single, closely monitored mines.
That adds costs that many end-users are not yet willing to pay, de Montmollin said. 
Metalor first started buying gold from small miners in Peru in the late 1990s and has experienced problems before: In 2004, U.S. authorities fined one of its subsidiaries for being slow to respond after employees found couriers were picking up gold from the refinery and repackaging it in shampoo bottles to smuggle to South America. The company improved its compliance systems. 
In 2007, according to Swiss prosecutorial documents seen by Reuters, Switzerland s Attorney General opened an investigation into two Peruvian mining companies it suspected had laundered drug profits through cash and gold sent for refining to Metalor. Metalor said it stopped buying and refining gold from them in 2007. The Swiss closed their inquiry in 2008. 
Jose Camino, Metalor s legal counsel since 2014, said these cases emerged under previous managements and were no reflection of Metalor today. 
Instead, Metalor worked with government officials on a new approach: Informal miners in Peru could sell their gold without fear of prosecution if they submitted a sworn statement saying they were committed to establishing legal tax-paying businesses, or becoming ""formalized."" 
A Peruvian state company, Activos Mineros, was tasked with commercializing the gold. In 2014, it hired four companies nationwide to buy it at prices above the black market. Minerales del Sur, which already did business with Metalor, won the tender for Puno: It would check that gold genuinely came from miners on the program, and smelt the fragments it collected into bars. These, it would fly to Switzerland to be refined. 
The following year, Minerales del Sur s shipments to Metalor more than doubled to some 16 tonnes, worth over half a billion dollars, according to prosecutorial documents seen by Reuters. 
In a press release in 2015, Metalor said the project had implemented ""clear reporting and verification of supply chain of minerals.""
CACHORREO
But the program is flawed, say prosecutors, auditors and the government. One problem, said Valencia at the Energy and Mines ministry, is ""basically, anyone could sign up."" This means some of those in the program may not be miners. 
Another gap: Rather than signing up for taxes and regulation, participants need only swear they intend to work toward that goal. 
If they do, their names are listed in a ""Commitment Register"" at the mining ministry. Miners with such sworn declarations have in effect been shielded from prosecution for illegal mining. 
That, said environmental crimes prosecutor Chavarry, has created an atmosphere of impunity. He said he, too, had tried in vain to enforce the law in La Rinconada. He once seized a truck with 200 kilos in contraband explosives. ""They didn t let me take it,"" he said of the suspects. ""They threatened to burn the truck, to burn me alive and to burn the police officers supporting me alive.""
Peru s deadlines for miners to formalize have been repeatedly extended. So far, about 9,000 people have formalized out of around 200,000 on the Commitment Register nationwide, said Valencia. 
Much of Metalor s gold came from suppliers on the Commitment Register, which was the basis of its assurances that its suppliers were legal. ""We were checking all the documentation one by one,"" said Camino. To this day, Metalor said, all but one of the suppliers are still listed on the Commitment Register. 
But Metalor s checks missed flaws flagged years ago. An auditor s report, reviewed by Reuters, found problems already in 2015, a year after the program started. 
The auditor, Rejas, Alva y Asociados, sent inspectors to Minerales del Sur s operations in the region. In sites including La Rinconada, they found many miners worked mainly as unpaid laborers for contractors, which sold gold to suppliers on the register. 
It s a system called ""cachorreo"" - a term with no direct translation from Spanish - and miners in La Rinconada told Reuters it is still widespread. Companies with legal concessions rent tunnels to contractors who hire hundreds of miners - as well as the women scavenging for rocks on the mountainsides - to extract metal.
Most of the time, the concession-holders take all the miners  rocks but do not pay them for an initial period. This is illegal, said Cesar Ipenza, a lawyer and an expert on illegal and informal mining.
But after laboring for a while for the concession-holder, diggers are free for a short time to take whatever they can carry. Instead of wages, benefits, or social security, they live by crushing and processing the rocks and selling their gold to ""Compro Oro"" stores. 
La Rinconada miner and labor activist Filiberto Arapa said that of the estimated 18,000 miners in the shantytown, only about 3,000 are legal. ""The legal workers have their documents and benefits,"" he said. ""The rest don t even know who they re working for."" 
Metalor said it had not been aware of the practice. 
Several miners in La Rinconada said they were not interested in formalizing. 
""If you work for a formal company, you receive labor benefits but make less,"" said Martin, a 36-year-old former farmer. He said he digs for one day in six entirely for himself and pockets between 1,000 and 2,000 soles a month. Peru s minimum wage is 930 soles, or $275. ""For me, it s better to make a little more"" by mining illegally, he said.
UNKNOWN ORIGINS
A second audit of the program, also reviewed by Reuters, found more gaps. 
During 2015 and 2016 the auditor, Inveritas Global Holdings, visited the 10 biggest gold suppliers in the scheme - five in Puno, and five in the Amazon region - and found four of Minerales del Sur s top five suppliers in Puno were booking big sales without mining at all. It also found Minerales del Sur had not provided evidence it checked its suppliers. 
""They re using their sworn declarations as legal guise to commercialize gold of unknown origins,"" concluded the report, which states that it was sent to Activos Mineros in May 2017. 
Activos Mineros said it could not comment in detail while the investigation is underway. But it said none of the companies it hired had criminal convictions when they tendered. Minerales del Sur, it added, did not come under investigation until July 2018 and has not registered any transactions in the program since then.
Valencia said the mines ministry did not see the audit reports, and Metalor executives told Reuters they had not seen them either. 
Metalor said it had been reassured the program was working by Activos Mineros  decision in 2018 to renew its contract with Minerales del Sur. ""If you renew the contract, that means that everything is okay. If not, you don t,"" Camino said.
The refinery said it will focus in future on gold from industrial mining companies, whose origin is clearer. It was a difficult decision, it said - in part because Metalor pulling out of the Peruvian program means that buyers with less concern for good practice will step in. 

""It s better to be part of something which is not perfect, but that at least things are improving, than doing nothing,"" said de Montmollin. ""We regret the decision, because gold will find its way, either way."""

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks tumbled again at the opening Friday as the number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus topped 100,000.
Investors fled equities and other risk assets with increasing urgency, pushing the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond down to an all-time low of 0.69% at one stage.
By 9:35 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 736 points or 2.8%. The S&P 500 was down 3.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.8%.
The Dow had already fallen by 970 points on Thursday.
The release of data showing the U.S. labor market in rude health in February was largely ignored, given that markets have put an increasingly narrow focus on the spread of the virus and the measures likely to be needed to contain it.  The economy added 273,000 jobs in February, far more than the 175,000 expected. January’s hiring was also revised up.
“Measures suspending travel, closing schools and enforcing temporary business closures and an increase in working from home all risk material economic disruption in the short term,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer with BlueBay Asset Management, in a weekly post. “With fear and some degree of panic driving sentiment, this can be further exacerbated, leading to a dangerous combination of both supply and demand shocks to the global economy.”
Data compiled by John Hopkins University showed that there are now 233 confirmed cases in the U.S., with 14 deaths recorded, of which 12 were in a single county in Washington state.
Earlier, President Donald Trump cancelled a planned visit to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The White House said in a statement that Trump, who has called the virus a “Democratic hoax” and repeatedly compared it a routine seasonal flu outbreak, “does not want to interfere with the CDC’s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency.""
Among individual stocks, JPMorgan  stock fell 6.3% after the bank confirmed that chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had had to undergo heart surgery. The bank will be run jointly by its two co-chief operating officers while Dimon recovers.
JPMorgan stock has already fallen some 17% over the past two weeks, along with many other bank stocks. High market volatility has led to the cancellation of many deals, while the Federal Reserve’s emergency interest rate cut will put fresh pressure on lending margins, allowing homeowners and consumers to refinance debt at lower levels.

Many of the exclusion requests for medical products appear to have been expedited amid the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak, with approvals granted just over one month past a Jan. 31 application deadline.
Requests to exclude other products from President Donald Trump s Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods have taken months. Apple  Inc s requests for exclusions on products from AirPod headphones to the HomePod smart speaker filed on Oct. 31 are still pending.
Medline International Inc has already received exclusions on 30 products ranging from surgical gowns to face masks and medicine cups, most of which the company applied for at the end of January. A number of the exclusions were granted on Thursday, USTR documents showed.
The products were included in a fourth round of tariffs on Chinese goods imposed by Trump on Sept. 1, 2019, amid heated U.S.-China trade negotiations.

The tariff rate on the medical products was initially set at 15%, but was lowered to 7.5% on Feb. 15 as part of the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade agreement. The deal leaves in place tariffs on about $370 billion worth of imports from China, including 25% duties on goods valued at around $250 billion. "

Known as SXSW, the annual showcase of pop culture had been scheduled to run March 13 to 22. Organizers and local officials said at a news conference that they had concluded it was unwise to draw crowds of people together in close proximity with the number of coronavirus cases rising around the world.
The novel coronavirus has spread across more than 90 countries. No cases have been confirmed in Austin.
""It is not a panic decision,"" Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt said of the cancellation.
SXSW began 33 years ago as a music festival but evolved to also highlight technology, video games, TV shows and movies. It has become a major promotional event for media and tech companies and last year attracted more than 417,000 people, organizers said.
Apple Inc , Netflix Inc ,  Facebook Inc   and others had pulled out of the festival in recent days, ramping up the pressure to scrap it entirely.
The spread of coronavirus, which has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,400, has sent ripples throughout the media, music and technology businesses.
Earlier this week, Comcast  Corp s Universal Pictures postponed the global release of James Bond movie ""No Time to Die,"" originally scheduled for April, to November. And the Ultra Music Festival, one of the world s largest dance music festivals and set for this month in Miami, was canceled."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Shares of Saudi state oil company Aramco (SE:2222) slumped below their initial public offering (IPO) price on Sunday for the first time since they began trading in December, after OPEC s pact with Russia to restrict oil supplies fell apart on Friday.
Aramco shares were down 6.2% at 30.85 riyals ($8.22) at 0852 GMT, their sharpest percentage fall in a day, and below the IPO price of 32 riyals. The Saudi market (TASI) was down 7.4%.
Aramco s record IPO in December gave it a price tag of $1.7 trillion, making it the world s most valuable company. The stock hit an intraday high of 38.70 riyals on its second day of trading, but has eased since then.
The shares have fallen more than 11% since the start of the year amid concerns the coronavirus outbreak will slow oil demand from China and hurt the global economy. 
Oil prices have also slumped, and fell further on Friday after a three-year pact between OPEC and Russia aimed at supporting the market ended in acrimony when Moscow refused to back deeper production cuts. OPEC responded by removing all limits on its own production. [O/R]
""Aramco is under pressure because of the failure of the deal,"" said Marie Salem, head of institutions at Daman Securities. 
Other Gulf markets were also in the red. The Abu Dhabi stock index (ADI) was down 5.8% and Dubai s (DFMGI) down 7.4%.
""We expect to see Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other large producers in OPEC increase production over the rest of 2020 as they return to a market-share strategy rather than price targeting,"" said Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD in a note on Sunday
""The market-share strategy bears considerable risk for OPEC producers as fiscal positions would deteriorate and balance of payments crises and questions about the sustainability of monetary policy re-emerge.""
Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the world’s biggest oil exporter. Its economy has suffered in recent years from low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit.
Jaap Meijer, head of equity research at Arqaam Capital, said Aramco investors should be sheltered by the guaranteed dividend streams, as the government will scale back its own dividend payments to protect minority shareholders.

Aramco has planned a dividend of $75 billion for 2020, more than five times larger than Apple Inc s  payout, which is among the biggest for an S&P 500 company."
439,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/swatch-group-ceo-sees-massive-temporary-hit-in-china-from-coronavirus-2104058,2020-03-08,Swatch Group CEO sees 'massive' temporary hit in China from coronavirus By Reuters,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group  is taking a ""massive"" hit from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that sharply affected business in major market China, Chief Executive Nick Hayek said in a Sunday newspaper interview.
""Given our very strong market position in China, of course we are massively hit by the temporary closing of hundreds of stores,"" he told Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.
""But we are seeing fewer problems on the supply chain side because Swatch Group produces a lot by itself in Switzerland,"" he added.
""We are a basically solid group without debt and not infected by the virus of stock market short-termism. This situation as well will get better despite all the prophets of doom.""
Hayek dismissed suggestions that the Swiss watch industry was at risk from lower-cost foreign rivals or digital smartwatches like Apple Inc s Apple Watch .
""I don t see a crisis for the Swiss watch industry. On the contrary,"" he was quoted as saying, noting actual sales were more important than export data.
""Since 2010 the middle and upper segment at Swatch Group with its seven brands from Tissot to Longines has grown by more than 36% to far more than six million pieces,"" he said.
""Tissot alone -- and this is the first time I make this public -- has grown more than 30% since 2010 to around 3.6 million pieces. Tissot s only sharp drop in volume was last year, with a fall of around 250,000 pieces in the second half due to the situation in Hong Kong.""
Unrest amid pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong was having a notable effect, but Tissot sales in the United States and Japan were up by around a third last year versus 2015, he noted.
Hayek said exports of entry-level Swiss watches were falling because other manufacturers were focusing solely on the luxury segment in the false belief that was the only area to make money.
Asked about attacks on the mid-priced segment by Apple Watch, Hayek said Swatch had cut its distribution network by around 30% since 2015 because many department stores and shops were hit by online competition.
He acknowledged the company should have acted faster to switch to e-commerce, but said it was well on the way to break the one million barrier in online sales this year.
Swatch was also hit in the lower-price segment by the Swiss franc s strong appreciation since the Swiss central bank ended its ceiling against the euro (EURCHF=) in 2015, he said."

The Trump administration is drafting measures to blunt the economic fallout and help slow the disease’s spread in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. Countries from Germany to New Zealand also announced financial plans to counter the impact of the virus.
Italy introduced far-reaching measures to contain the disease’s spread, while officials in South Korea said the outbreak there is showing signs of slowing. Financial markets saw wild moves as a price war in crude added to fears over the coronavirus.
Key Developments:

Trump Aides Drafting Economic Measures (11:56 a.m. HK)
The Trump administration is drafting measures to blunt the economic fallout from coronavirus and help slow its spread in the U.S., including a temporary expansion of paid sick leave and possible help for companies facing disruption from the outbreak, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The economic package is still being debated and hasn’t yet been presented to President Donald Trump. Some of its components could change, while others, such as a sick leave plan, may require congressional action.
The timing of any of the economic measures is unclear, but they would likely be rolled out on a step-by-step basis, beginning with aid to individual Americans who are infected, then expanding to companies and workers affected by lost business.
Pressure is growing on Trump to take more decisive action in response to the virus outbreak, as the number of cases in the U.S. and worldwide continues to grow.
Germany Boosts Investments to Bolster Economy (11:29 a.m. HK)
The government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel has taken its first steps to help companies and workers affected by the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak and will invest an additional 12.4 billion euros ($14.1 billion) between 2021 and 2024.
After more than seven hours of talks on Sunday night, Merkel’s coalition loosened rules for short-term work compensation, making it easier for big companies heavily affected by the virus like Deutsche Lufthansa  AG to apply for aid to offset wages when they are forced to temporarily halt work.
Pressure for Germany to act intensified in the days before leaders of Merkel’s Christian Democratic-led bloc and the Social Democrats met in the chancellery in Berlin. The death of the first German from the coronavirus, a 60-year-old man who vacationed in Egypt, added to the pressure. While short of the full-blown stimulus package that many economists and investors urged, Germany’s government sought to walk a fine line between reassuring business and avoiding public panic.
China 2020 Car Sales Seen Falling 8% (11:20 a.m. HK)
China’s car sales are set to fall 8% this year, the head of a Chinese auto-industry group said, slashing his forecast for a second time as the coronavirus keeps buyers away. The prediction is preliminary and the China Passenger Car Association will confirm its new forecast later Monday, Cui Dongshu, the group’s secretary general, said in an interview. The PCA last month predicted a 5% decline after initially forecasting 1% growth at the end of last year.
Shanghai Disney Resumes Some Operations (11:07 a.m. HK)
Shanghai Disney Resort will partly resume operations on Monday, with a limited number of shopping, dining and recreational facilities available in Disneytown, Wishing Star Park and Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, according to an official statement. Shanghai Disneyland remains closed as the company continues to monitor health and safety conditions.
 BNP Paribas   Open Tennis Tournament Canceled (10:34 a.m. HK)
The BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, has been canceled because of coronavirus concerns, the tournament said in a statement. Indian Wells, while not a major event in the sport, is a landmark tournament that was to have featured top stars including Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.
South Korea Outbreak May Be Slowing: Officials (10:23 a.m. HK)
The coronavirus outbreak in South Korea is showing signs of slowing as the rate of new daily infections falls and health authorities almost finished testing members of a religious sect at the center of the epidemic, the country’s health minister said.
Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said late Sunday the virus spread -- once the biggest globally outside of China -- appeared to be “a little bit stagnant.”
South Korea was averaging more than 500 new virus infections a day last week, but the daily tally has fallen below that for the last three days, said Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun. The trend continued on Monday, as the country reported 248 new cases for a total of 7,382 thus far, and now ranks behind Italy in the size of its outbreak.
South Korea has borne its virus outbreak relatively well despite the scale of the spread. The country has been testing people for the virus at the fastest pace in the world, which appears to have allowed early detection of cases and kept its mortality rate lower than average. Infections have also been largely contained to the city of Daegu and surrounding areas, although the government has not imposed restrictions over people’s movements like in China and Italy.
Columbia, Scarsdale Schools Suspend Classes (9:33 a.m. HK)
Columbia University and Scarsdale, New York, one of the most affluent towns in America, suspended classes amid coronavirus concerns.
Columbia said it will suspend classes on Monday and Tuesday, and hold them remotely for the rest of the week, after a person affiliated with the school was exposed to the disease.
The individual hasn’t been diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus so far, university president Lee C. Bollinger said in an email to students.
“Please understand that the decision to suspend classes does not mean that the University is shutting down,” Bollinger said. “This action is intended to prevent the virus from spreading.”
The school had already planned to be closed the following week for spring break, which would cover the typical 14-day quarantine period for the virus.
Scarsdale, meanwhile, is shutting its schools after a faculty member tested positive for coronavirus. All Scarsdale schools will close through March 18 for cleaning, progress monitoring and social distancing, the district said in a statement.
Scarsdale, a Westchester commuter suburb that is a 55-minute train ride to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, ranks second on the Bloomberg 2020 Richest Places list.
Duterte Declares Emergency in Philippines (9:17 a.m. HK)
President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a state of public health emergency as the Philippines reported additional coronavirus cases.
The declaration empowers government to cap prices of basic goods and scrap public bidding for medical supplies, Duterte’s spokesman Salvador Panelo said in an interview with DZBB radio on Monday. Health Secretary Francisco Duque earlier said the order will also pave the way for easier access to funds to control the spread of the virus.
At least four cities in the Philippine capital region and a couple of nearby areas have suspended classes after the health department reported four new cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 10.
China Reports 40 New Cases, 22 Deaths (8:23 a.m. HK)
China reported 40 additional coronavirus cases for the end of March 8, with 36 of them from Hubei province, according to statement from China’s National Health Commission. The other four are imported cases.
China now has 80,735 total confirmed coronavirus cases. The death toll on the mainland rose by 22 to 3,119, as Hubei reported 21 fatalities. Discharged patients rose by 1,535 to 58,600.
Ted Cruz Begins 14-Day Quarantine (7:45 a.m. HK)
Two Republican lawmakers will self-quarantine in their houses after contact at a recent political conference with a person who later tested positive for coronavirus.
Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said he will quarantine himself for 14 days after learning he briefly interacted with someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference who has tested positive for Covid-19.
Cruz said he had a brief conversation and a handshake at the meeting held in Maryland in late February.
“I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy,” Cruz said in a statement. “Given that the interaction was 10 days ago, that the average incubation period is 5-6 days, that the interaction was for less than a minute, and that I have no current symptoms, the medical authorities have advised me that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low.”
Republican Representative Paul Gosar, a dentist by trade from Arizona who had extended contact with the person at CPAC, said in a statement that he will close his Washington office for a week. Gosar and three senior staff members will self-quarantine this week, with Gosar staying at home in Arizona.
NYC Urges Disrupting Routines (7:15 a.m. HK)
New Yorkers should avoid the subway at rush hour by cycling or walking to work, or stay home and telecommute, as Mayor Bill De Blasio outlined plans to fight the coronavirus. International travel has been canceled for city workers and school students.
New York City has 13 confirmed cases. The state has 105 cases, mostly in the city and the suburbs.
At a briefing, de Blasio prepared the city for a surge of cases as more people are tested: “I think we could well be at hundred cases or hundreds of cases over next two or three weeks,” he said.
Democrat Sanders Calls for Free Vaccine (7 a.m. HK)
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders says any eventual vaccine for the new coronavirus should be available free of charge once developed and approved. Democrats have increasingly called for affordability guarantees for medicines developed in part through taxpayer-funded research.
Saudi Arabia Blocks Some Travel (6:55 a.m. HK)
Saudi Arabia temporarily banned travel to nine countries, state-run SPA reported, citing a statement issued by the Interior Ministry. The decision applies to citizens as well as residents; entry of citizens from the nine countries is also banned. The countries include the U.A.E, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, South Korea, Egypt, Italy and Iraq.
Some Elderly Warned Against Cruises (6 a.m. HK)
The U.S. State Department warned Americans with underlying health conditions against travel on cruise ships, citing the higher risk of contracting the coronavirus and complications when infections occur.
The warning, on the department’s travel advice website, said some ships with ill passengers have been denied by local officials the right to dock at ports, which prevents passengers from disembarking.
“Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues should avoid situations that put them at increased risk for more severe disease,” the agency said. “This entails avoiding crowded places, avoiding non-essential travel such as long plane trips, and especially avoiding embarking on cruise ships.”
The Grand Princess liner, off the California coast with more than 20 ill passengers and crew, is scheduled to dock on Monday after being denied entry in San Francisco. In Asia, Malaysia banned cruise ships. Carnival  Corp. had hundreds of infected passengers aboard its Diamond Princess ship, which docked off Yokohama last month.
U.S. Advised on Daily Disruptions (5 p.m. NY)
U.S. officials went on Sunday talk shows to brace Americans for more changes to their daily routines as a result of Covid-19, from reduced travel to cancellations of large events.
Elderly people with health issues should immediately reconsider travel and large gatherings, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“You should start to distance yourself from the risk, crowds, getting on a plane, on a long plane trip, and, above all, don’t get on a cruise ship,” Fauci advised people with underlying health risks on “Fox News Sunday.”
France Bans Some Large Gatherings (4 p.m. NY)
France has banned gatherings with more than 1,000 people, down from 5,000 previously, Health Minister Olivier Veran said in Paris. There will be some exceptions in cases that are in the interest of the nation, he said.
Total coronavirus cases rose to 1,126, with 19 fatalities.
Seattle Nursing Home Deaths Mount (3:55 p.m. NY)
The number of reported virus cases in King County, home to Seattle and its suburbs, jumped to 83, public health officials said in a statement. Among 12 new cases reported, two additional people have died -- one a woman in her 80s and the other a man in his 90s.
King County has been an epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., with 17 deaths. All but one of those has been linked to an elder care facility in Kirkland, Washington. The total state death toll is 18.
Washington state officials reported 21 new cases, raising the total to 123 from 102.
Apple  Workers Can Work at Home (3 p.m. NY)
Apple employees at most offices have been offered the ability to work from home by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who called the virus outbreak an “unprecedented event” and a “challenging moment.”
Cook told workers that if their jobs allow it, they can work remotely March 9-13, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. That extends the company’s move on Friday to encourage employees in California and Seattle to work remotely.
This policy covers areas with the greatest density of infections, Cook said: the Santa Clara Valley and Elk Grove areas in California, Seattle, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland and the U.K.
Saudi Arabia Closes Schools: SPA (2:45 p.m. NY)
The Saudi Higher Education Ministry temporarily shut all schools and colleges until further notice to avoid the spread of the coronavirus, the state-run SPA reported.The education ministry said it would begin remote visual schooling during the suspension, according to the report.
Italy’s Rules Spark Enforcement Doubts (1:45 p.m. NY)
Italy introduced far-reaching measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, yet hours after the dramatic early Sunday morning announcement, it was far from clear how strictly they would be enforced.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte presented the new rules, including a near-complete travel ban for about a quarter of Italians, following hours of uncontrolled leaks and signs of public panic. On Sunday morning, life seemed to continue as normal even in the regions most affected by the epidemic, with people crowding cafes and boarding trains to go north and south. Airports, including those in the affected areas, also remained open."

Investing.com -- Trading in U.S. stock markets was halted within minutes of opening on Monday, as major indices broke through the level that triggered the New York Stock Exchange’s ‘circuit-breakers’ amid a fresh wave of panic-selling.
Trading was halted with the  S&P 500 down 7.1% from Friday’s close at 2,762 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,833 points, or 7.1%, from Friday. 
The latest wave of selling put the market on course for its worst one-day drop since 2009. It came in response to a disorderly rout in the oil market as Saudi Arabia launched an all-out price war to reclaim market share from Russia and U.S. shale producers.  
The kingdom signaled it would sharply raise output in a market that is already badly oversupplied due to a virus-induced collapse in demand. The International Energy Agency warned earlier on Monday that global oil demand would fall for the first time in a decade this year, having earlier forecast demand growth of some 1.2 million barrels a day.
The resulting 30% drop in U.S. crude prices triggered wholesale selling of oil and gas names, with oilfield service providers Schlumberger  and Halliburton  among the worst hit. Highly-leveraged shale producers such as Continental Resources  and Whiting Petroleum  also plunged.
Elsewhere, Apple  fell 7.4% after Chinese data showed its iPhones sales fell 60% on the year in China in February. The number fleshed out Apple’s sales warning last month, when it declined to offer a new forecast after saying it would miss its original target.
Also weighing on the index was DJ heavyweight Boeing , which fell `11.6% to its lowest since 2017 after The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are set to delay the return to service of the 737 MAX even further, due to problems with its electrical wiring."

China placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Lunar New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February.
In total, mobile phone brands sold a total of 6.34 million devices in February in China, down 54.7% from 14 million in the same month last year, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed (CAICT).
It was also the lowest level for February since at least 2012, when CAICT started publishing data.
Shares of the iPhone maker fell about 6% amid a broader slump in Wall Street on rising fears of a recession due to a steep fall in oil prices and the fast-spreading virus.
""While this is very nervous time...we caution that Chinese demand in the March quarter is not the trend, but a ""shock event"" that we believe will be short lived,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.
Android brands, which include devices made by Huawei Technologies  and  Xiaomi  (HK:1810), accounted for most of the drop, as they collectively saw shipments decline from 12.72 million units in February 2019 to 5.85 million, the data showed.
Shipments of Apple devices slumped to 494,000, from 1.27 million in February 2019. In January, its shipments had held steady at just over 2 million.
Research firms IDC and Canalys previously forecast that overall smartphone shipments would drop by about 40% in the first quarter as the virus outbreak hit demand and disrupted supply chains.
Apple s branded stores in China were shut for at least two weeks in February as fears over the epidemic mounted."

Investing.com – The Dow suffered its biggest one-day point drop on record, led by a slump in oil prices, as Saudi Arabia sparked fears of a price war and the coronavirus spread deepened fears of a global recession.
The S&P 500 fell 7.6%, Nasdaq Composite lost 7.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.8%, its biggest daily percentage loss since December 2008. It was down more than 2,013 points.
Oil prices fell 24%, their worst day since 1991, sending energy stocks tumbling after Saudi Arabia launched a price war against fellow oil superpower Russia.
Saudi Arabia slashed its April official selling prices by $6 to $8 to grab market share and pile pressure on Russia. The move came after OPEC and Russia failed to agree a deal to extend oil production cuts.
""This situation seems to have no equal in oil market history,"" International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol said, referring to ""a massive supply overhang and significant demand shocks (as) the major main driver of the crisis,""
The coronavirus threat to global growth, meanwhile, continued to sour investor sentiment as infections continued to mount, with the total death toll reaching nearly 4,000, and as many as 111,000 infected.
In Italy, the death toll increased by 97 to 463 in one day, with the total number of confirmed cases rising to 9,172 from 7,375 – the most infections outside of China, where infections have been slowing.
In tech, meanwhile, FANG stocks were shunned, with Apple  leading the decline as the hit to iPhone sales in China from the outbreak could be worse than feared.
Apple sold 494,000 iPhones last month, down from 1.27 million a year earlier, Wedbush said, citing initial data Chinese Academy of Information and Communications Technology s. It closed down 7.9%.
The rout on Wall Street drove investors toward safe havens like Treasuries, pushing yields to record lows at a time when some are betting the Federal Reserve will cut rates aggressively. 
Goldman Sachs forecast that the Fed will slash interest rate by 50 basis points when policymakers gather on March 17-18 and again at their April 28-29 meeting, to a range of 0% to 0.25%, which was last seen in 2015."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Fears about the rapidly spreading coronavirus and its impact on the global economy, which deepened on Monday with the collapse of oil prices, have evaporated over $5 trillion of the S&P 500 s market value in recent weeks.
The U.S. stock benchmark s (SPX) 7.6% drop on Monday, which triggered a temporary trading halt in its biggest one-day decline since 2011, came after Saudi Arabia and Russia began a price war that threatens to overwhelm global oil markets with supply, causing crude prices to tumble 20% in their deepest daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War. 
That price war broke out after major oil producing countries failed to reach an agreement to cut output to make up for lower demand related to the coronavirus.
""It s a perfect storm. You ve got a lot of uncertainty in terms of how far the virus will spread in the U.S. You layer onto this the oil price cut. The third thing is financial instability, in the sense that with yields falling as far and as fast as they re falling,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisors Alliance.

Vietnam has mandated a 14-day quarantine for people coming from South Korea to curb the spread of the virus, which can be transmitted from person to person and has already reached more than 60 countries. South Korea has reported one of the highest number of infections outside China.
This has come as a blow to South Korean firms, which are the biggest foreign investors in Vietnam. Samsung Display runs a factory in the Southeast Asian country where it assembles OLED displays used in smartphones made by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), Apple  and Huawei.

PENANG, Malaysia (Reuters) - Tech firms at Malaysia s one-time Silicon Valley of the East, swimming in orders from customers fleeing trade war-hit China, have seen fortunes turn again in the space of just a year as the coronavirus outbreak cuts them off from Chinese suppliers.
Semiconductor test equipment manufacturer Pentamaster Corp Bhd  saw its shares more than double last year as sales surged by about a fifth - the steepest in its 29-year existence - as the firm became a refuge from Sino-U.S. import tariffs.
But then China sent workers home to slow the virus, stifling supplies of parts and material further upstream. Pentamaster called alternative sources in Japan, South Korea, Germany and Italy, only to find the action had left them in the lurch too.
The firm has since lowered its 2020 revenue growth outlook to flat from double digits, while its stock has fallen more than 10% since China in late January locked down the virus epicenter, Wuhan.
""Even if you source from another country, the other country also depends on China,"" said Pentamaster Executive Chairman Chuah Choon Bin.
Pentamaster s predicament is echoed across Malaysia s coastal state of Penang, one of the world s biggest electronics and electrical hubs, which had been losing business to China for the past decade until the trade war sparked a revival.
Home to factories owned by  Intel Corp   and Broadcom Inc  alongside numerous other firms that supply tech majors including Apple Inc , the state accounts for about 8% of global back-end semiconductor output.
Inbound investment reached a historic high last year. This year, however, the goal is just a third of that, at about $1.2 billion - though that is due to the life cycles of investments rather than the virus, the state government said.
ROLLER COASTER
The roller-coaster ride illustrates how quickly and broadly the virus is changing fortunes around the world.
While Penang firms saw record sales last year from customers seeking to curb reliance on China and escape U.S. tariffs, they themselves relied on China for as much as 60% of components and materials with the rest coming from Europe or elsewhere in Asia.
Analysts and local firms said the virus  sales impact would be acute in the April-June period when stockpiles run out. While many firms have warned of delays, some have seen orders surge as customers continue to seek suppliers outside of China.
""Good news: Product transfers from China are leading to more quotation requests and order overflow,"" said Goh Guek Eng, managing director at semiconductor products assembler Hotayi Electronic. ""Bad news: Materials are not coming in from China.""
Hotayi sources 60% of components such as printed circuit boards and multi-layer ceramic capacitors from China, for customers including  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930),  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) and Sharp Corp (T:6753).
Its sales soared 40% last year. Goh said its 20% target this year could be at risk due to the supply issues, which could turn critical in one to two months  time and badly hit production.
Pentamaster buys most of its components such as motors and sensors from Japan, Europe and China - the latter making up 20% to 30%. In the past few weeks, it has changed the design of some equipment to accommodate parts from outside China, Chuah said.
""We re able to get supplies but the lead time is long - two to three months from Europe,"" he said, compared with two to three weeks from anywhere under normal circumstances.
Analysts said other firms likely affected by the supply disruption include electronics manufacturing services companies  VS Industry Bhd   and ATA IMS Bhd  as they rely on China for up to 30% of components and material. Neither responded to Reuters  requests for comment.
Semiconductor company  Inari Amertron Bhd  , whose radio frequency components are used in smartphones including Apple s iPhones, might have a weak second half after the U.S. firm flagged slowing production and demand in China, Malaysia s AmInvestment Bank said.
Inari told Reuters the virus had indeed had an impact on its supply chain but ""probably less than the market feared"" as the situation in China was improving.
""We expect our performance to be in line with the overall growth, resilience or lack thereof, in the global semiconductor market,"" said Vice Chairman Tan Seng Chuan.
Globetronics Technology Bhd , a contract manufacturer of semiconductor-based products, told Reuters it did not directly source from China but that there was a small risk to its indirect supply chain.
""We had previously forecast the year over year growth for all semiconductors to be 5.5% in 2020,"" said Kevin Anderson, senior analyst for power semiconductors at consultancy Omdia. With the virus, ""now we think the range could be from -20% (worst case) up to 2.5% (best case), with a most likely of -3%"".
""All this depends very much on impact on the demand side as the virus spreads around the world and how quickly the electronics supply and logistics chains recover.""
Qdos, which makes flexible printed circuit boards and caters to five of the world s 10 biggest smartphone makers, cut its sales growth outlook to ""the low tens"" from 20% forecast last year, said Group Chief Executive Jeffrey Hwang.
""The supply chain in electronics and semiconductors is really long, so one way or another you touch China,"" said Hwang, whose company also has a factory in the Chinese city of Xiamen.

""China is a big supply chain that has served the world really well, so companies will not stop going to China entirely but probably they will cut down on dependence on China alone."""

Infections climbed across Europe and Italy attempted a nationwide lockdown, but the situation in Asia showed improvements. China announced only 19 new cases, the lowest since Jan. 18 according to official figures, while South Korea added 131 new infections, extending a declining trend. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the coronavirus epicenter of Wuhan for the first time since the disease emerged.
Trump said he will seek a payroll tax cut and “substantial relief” for industries that have been hit by the coronavirus. The economic package will leave out for now any aid for the travel industry, according to people familiar with the matter, raising the risk that the plan won’t go far enough to satisfy investors.
Key Developments:

Trump Package to Leave Out Travel Industry for Now (11:36 a.m. HK)
The U.S. economic package to be unveiled by President Donald Trump will leave out for now any aid for the travel industry, which has been battered by the coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the matter, raising the risk that the plan won’t go far enough to satisfy investors.
As outlined by Trump in remarks Monday, the proposal will likely include a payroll tax cut and a short-term expansion of paid sick leave, according to the people, who described the plan on condition of anonymity ahead of its planned release on Tuesday.
While the White House wants to find a way to help airlines and hospitality companies reeling from a plunge in demand from travelers, administration officials remain uncertain about the best way to do so.
China’s Xi Pays First Visit to Wuhan Since Outbreak (11:31 a.m HK)
Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the coronavirus epicenter of Wuhan for the first time since the disease emerged, state media said, a trip intended to project confidence that his government has managed to stem its spread domestically.
Xi arrived Tuesday morning in the capital of hard-hit Hubei province, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Wuhan, where the disease first emerged in December, has been quarantined since Jan. 23, in what some people see as a heavy-handed approach following earlier failures to act quickly enough to stem the spread.
U.S. Tests Fewer Than 5,000, Atlantic Reports (10:35 a.m. HK)
Only 4,384 people in the U.S. have been tested for the new coronavirus, nearly two weeks after the disease was found to be spreading across America, according to the Atlantic.
While more than 500 cases have been reported in the U.S., experts say the number is too small to reflect the full extent of the disease’s spread as not enough Americans have been tested, the Atlantic wrote.
“The lack of testing means that it is almost impossible to know how many Americans are infected with the coronavirus and suffering from Covid-19, the disease it causes,” the Atlantic wrote.
Trump Hasn’t Been Tested for Virus, White House Says (10:19 a.m. HK)
U.S. President Trump “has not received Covid-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed Covid-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
She said Trump “remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.”
SEC Asks Employees to Work From Home (10:18 a.m. HK)
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is encouraging employees at its sprawling Washington headquarters to work remotely beginning Tuesday amid concern that one of the agency’s workers may have contracted the coronavirus.
In an email to staff on Monday evening that was obtained by Bloomberg News, the SEC said that “out of an abundance of caution” it was requiring all people on the floor where the person sat to “telework.” The regulator said it was also reaching out to people with whom the person had been in contact, and that the agency had asked its landlord to have the area “deep cleaned.”
In a statement, the SEC confirmed that an employee was treated for respiratory symptoms and was being tested for coronavirus. The SEC told staff in the email that the employee hadn’t been at work since March 5 and that officials believed the person was “asymptomatic” while in the building.
Japan to Introduce Penalties for Mask Resales (10:17 a.m. HK)
Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government will introduce penalties on re-selling masks as it tries to head off price gouging and make sure there is an ample supply as the country battles the new coronavirus.
Boeing  Worker Quarantined (10:07 a.m. HK)
 Boeing Co . said an employee from its Everett facility in Washington state has tested positive for the virus and is now in quarantine. The company has asked coworkers who were in close contact with the person to remain home in self quarantine and monitor their health. It also said it conducted thorough cleaning of work areas and common spaces.
Apple China IPhone Shipments Dive 60% (10 a.m. HK)
Apple Inc .’s iPhone shipments in China plunged more than 60% in February, when the coronavirus outbreak shut down scores of its stores and hampered key manufacturing partners across its largest international market.
Shipments of Apple’s marquee device dropped to about 494,600 units from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on monthly data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think-tank. Overall mobile phone shipments, including Android devices, slid 56% to 6.4 million units, the academy said. Those year-earlier comparisons were skewed by the fact that the Lunar New Year holidays fell in February of 2019, versus January this year.
Since erupting in China in January, the Covid-19 epidemic has hit Apple’s supply and demand. While factories are gradually restarting after enforced quarantine, lingering production bottlenecks risk hurting global iPhone revenue in coming months.
South Korea Reports 131 New Coronavirus Cases (9:48 a.m. HK)
South Korea’s health ministry confirmed 131 more coronavirus cases in the nation, raising the total to 7,513, according to a statement. The number continues a declining trend since March 6. Total deaths in the country rose to 54 from 51 previously.
New White House Chief of Staff Quarantined (9:13 a.m. HK)
Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, has quarantined himself after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Meadows, a veteran Republican congressman from North Carolina, joins five other lawmakers who are putting themselves in quarantine or restricting their work after contact with people who tested positive for the virus.
Earlier Monday, Republican Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida announced that they had gone into self-imposed quarantine after learning they’d come in contact at a conservative group’s conference with an individual who subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Meadows was also in contact with that individual, the person familiar with the matter said on Monday night. He was tested for the coronavirus, and although that test came back negative and he has no symptoms, he’s staying at home until Wednesday, when the 14-day risk period expires, the person added.
Japan Cabinet Approves Bill for Emergency: Kyodo (9:09 a.m. HK)
Japan’s cabinet approved a bill that would enable the declaration of an emergency over the new coronavirus if needed, Kyodo News reported.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be able to declare an emergency in the case of a rapid nationwide spread of the infection, Kyodo said. Doing so would empower regional governors to call on local people to avoid going out, and for limits on the use of facilities where large numbers of people gather.
While his expert panel said Monday that there was, as yet, no explosive spread of the disease in the country, Abe told parliament he wanted to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Japan has confirmed more than 500 cases of the virus, with nine dead.
KKR Shuts London Offices After Virus Case (9:04 a.m. HK)
A KKR & Co. employee in London has the coronavirus, leading the private equity firm to close both of its offices in the city while it has them sanitized. KKR has asked employees at the London offices to work from home until further notice and is requiring all staff who had close contact with the person infected with the virus to quarantine themselves for 14 days.
Firms around the world have been preparing for more employees to work from home and separating parts of their work forces to limit the potential of an outbreak to disrupt operations key to financial markets. Firms including  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  HSBC Holdings  Plc  and  Wells Fargo   & Co. have confronted cases of the virus among staff in recent days.
China Reports 19 New Cases, 17 New Deaths (8:26 a.m. HK)
China reported 19 additional coronavirus cases as of March 9, according to a statement from the National Health Commission, bringing the total number of infections to 80,754. The new cases are the lowest since Jan. 18.
The death toll in China rose by 17 to 3,136, with all of the latest fatalities occurring in Hubei. Discharged patients rose by 1,297 to a total of 59,897.
U.S. Sports Leagues Limit Locker Room Access (7:53 a.m. HK)
Major U.S. pro sports leagues are banning media and anyone other than necessary personnel from team locker rooms.
Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League will limit locker room and clubhouse access to players and “essential employees” of teams, the leagues said in a joint statement. Media access will be maintained in designated areas outside locker rooms and clubhouses, the statement said.
The move is the latest response by sports organizations to the coronavirus outbreak. But it stops short of some of the more extreme measures that some leagues have imposed around the world, such as canceling games or holding competitions with no spectators.
U.S. to Produce 4 Million Tests a Week: Azar (7:44 a.m. HK)
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that by the end of the week, the U.S. expects to produce 4 million coronavirus tests each week. He said 2.1 million tests have shipped or are ready to be shipped, and that so far no individual that a public health official has said has needed a test has gone without one.
Italy to Extend Travel Ban Nationwide (4:52 p.m. NY)
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he’ll move to extend restrictive measures on travel -- currently in force in the north -- throughout the rest of the country in a bid to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
WHO Says Outbreak Close to Being a Pandemic (12:53 p.m. NY)
The spread of the new coronavirus is very close to being a pandemic after the disease has reached more than 100 countries, Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program, said at a daily briefing.
“The threat of a pandemic has become very real,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled.”
Ryan said countries that shift solely to mitigation are conceding defeat and that they shouldn’t give up on containment efforts. The WHO said China and South Korea’s efforts have borne fruit, and that it hopes to see results from Italy’s recent measures in coming days.
The mortality rate for people 80 and over exceeds 20%, said Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, citing figures from the WHO’s mission to China.

The virus has yet to spread as quickly in Ireland as other European countries, but the government has canceled all St. Patrick s Day parades due to take place across the country next week to limit the impact. The government has also set aside 3 billion euros to tackle the infection.
Apple , which is one of Ireland s largest multinational employers, said the employee who tested positive is now in self-isolation and that they feel the risk to others is low while they coordinate closely with local health authorities.
Apple employs 6,000 workers in Ireland s second largest city of Cork. The iPhone maker said in a statement that it had asked some workers to stay at home as a precaution and that it was continuing to regularly deep clean all its offices and stores.
In Dublin, Trinity College said lectures would be delivered online for the rest of the academic year to May 31, with tutorials, seminars and laboratory practicals continuing using social distancing protocol.
A floor in one of the 428-year old university s buildings was closed as a precautionary measure last week after it was informed of a positive case within the city-center campus.
In a further blow to Dublin s tourism sector, Trinity said it would also close its Book of Kells exhibition. The ancient illuminated manuscript book created by Celtic monks in about 800 AD is one of Ireland s top tourist attractions."

Investing.com - The Dow continued its advance after turning positive earlier in the session Tuesday as investors digested reports that Trump wants the payroll tax cuts to be delivered during the U.S. November election to boost his chances of reelection. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 684 points, or 2.9%, from a low of about 160 points, though had been up more than 1,000 points earlier. The S&P 500 added 2.6%, Nasdaq Composite gained 3%.
Donald Trump reportedly told Republican senators on Tuesday that he wants a payroll tax holiday through the November election so that taxes won’t go back up before voters decide whether to return him to office, Bloomberg reported, citing three people familiar with the president’s remarks.
The announced arrived in a day filled with stimulus pledges to support the economy and combat the coronavirus from the White House. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said insurance companies would cover coronavirus treatment, but the broader market remained under pressure as the spread of the virus continued.
""All the insurance companies here, either today or before today, have agreed to waive all co-pays on coronavirus testing and coronavirus treatment in their benefit plans,” Pence said. ""Medicare and Medicaid already made it clear to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries that coronavirus would be covered and treatment.""
The announcement delivered a slight boost to markets, but with sentiment on stocks still likely to driven by the latest virus headlines, investor worries about it becoming a global pandemic lurked in the background.
The uptick in risk assets, however, was led by technology as investors piled into beaten up FANG stocks, with Apple  rising more than 3%.
A rebound in Treasury yields from a historic day on Monday, when the 10-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest level ever, spurred a rally in financial, mostly banking stocks, which are vulnerable to a lower interest rate environment.
The Trump administration reportedly is also mulling plans to launch federal assistance to struggling oil and gas producers, the Washington Post reported. The federal assistance is likely to include low-interest government loans to the shale companies, which have seen credit lines dry up, the report added."

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Intel on Tuesday said EU antitrust regulators got it wrong when they fined the chipmaker 1.06 billion euros ($1.2 billion) more than a decade ago for thwarting a British rival in a case that could affect Google and Qualcomm .
The U.S. company set out its arguments at the General Court in a re-hearing of a case seen as testing the European Commission s power to go after U.S. tech giants which offer incentives such as rebates to lure customers from competitors.
EU antitrust enforcers in 2009 said Intel tried to block Advanced Micro Devices  by giving rebates to computer makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their chips from Intel.
The General Court is hearing the case for the second time after the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe s highest, in 2017 disagreed with its 2014 ruling backing the Commission s decision, in a major setback to the EU competition watchdog.
It told the lower tribunal to re-examine the case and whether exclusivity rebates actually harmed competition.
The Commission s decision was fundamentally flawed, Intel s lawyer Daniel Beard told the panel of five judges.
""The Commission either took a wrong approach in its decision or it carried out an as efficient competitor (AEC) test and it got it wrong,"" he said.
An AEC test is an economic analysis that determines if a dominant company knocks out competitors that are as efficient or more efficient through anti-competitive practices while pushing out a less efficient rival may not be problematic for regulators.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan criticised Intel for seeking to re-open the entire case.
""That was assessed very exhaustively in 2014. Intel s request is a second bite at the cherry,"" he told judges.
The Association for Competitive Technology is supporting Intel while French consumer body UFC is backing the Commission. A judgment is likely to come next year while the losing party can appeal to the CJEU.
Qualcomm has challenged a 997-million-euro EU fine for paying iPhone maker Apple  to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel. 
Alphabet  unit Google has also challenged a record 4.34-billion euro EU antitrust fine levied for using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.

The case is T-286/09 RENV Intel Corporation  v Commission."

455,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-adidas-plummets-after-grim-china-sales-update-2106839,2020-03-11,StockBeat: Adidas Plummets After Grim China Sales Update By Investing.com,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Sportswear company Adidas  fell to the bottom of the German DAX on Wednesday after revealing the scale of the impact it’s facing from the coronavirus.
In what’s becoming a pattern, the company was unable to say how badly it expected this year’s business to be hurt by an outbreak. And understandably so, given that the European soccer championships and the summer Olympic games – both of which traditionally give a significant boost to sales – may be disrupted by the disease.
Adidas stock fell 6.0% at opening, before recovering to be down only 5.2% by 4:15 AM ET (0915 GMT). The DAX was up 1.9% in line with other European markets as the Bank of England’s emergency rate cut and loosening of prudential policy strengthened belief in a coordinated global policy response to the economic impact of the crisis. The Stoxx 600 and U.K. FTSE 100 were up 1.2%.
As with Apple , another company that was unable to say how bad things would get in the first quarter, Adidas has a two-fold problem: China, where the outbreak began and which implemented the most drastic quarantining measures to stop the disease, is both a major market and a key part of its supply chain.
Sales in Greater China were down by anything between 800 million and 1 billion euros from a year earlier in the first two months of the year, the company said in an update on Wednesday. That alone translates into a hit of between 400 million and 500 million euros on operating profit.
“In addition, the company has started to observe traffic declines with a corresponding negative business impact in Japan and South Korea,” it added, without providing further details.
That is causing some big problems in inventory management, raising the risks of discounting later in the year. The company said it canceled all shipments in February and faces “a significant amount of product takebacks, which the company plans to clear through its own channels throughout the remainder of the year.”
On the plus side, Adidas said most of its factories in China are operational again and added that its global sourcing activities have not been hit yet.
Adidas’ stock was arguably riding for a fall, after rising relentlessly over the last year in the face of economic slowdowns in both China and Europe, its most important market. Even after falling by one-third from its January peak, the shares are still not cheap at 24.7 times trailing earnings, although a strong secular outlook for sportswear, a powerful brand and one of the continent’s most respected CEOs in Kasper Rorsted all argue for a premium valuation.
Rorsted told Bloomberg TV with refreshing honesty that he doesn’t expect sports gear to be at the top of people’s priorities as they emerge from quarantine, and that, as such, he expects the recovery to take “some time.”"

In a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said recent reports indicated a wide array of U.S. companies, including Apple , Kraft Heinz , Coca-Cola , and the Gap, had sourced, or continued to source, goods from Xinjiang. 
""Moreover, there are consistent reports that U.S. companies fail to undertake basic labor and human rights assessments in Xinjiang, in essence willfully ignoring the horrific conditions of forced labor in Xinjiang,"" Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said in the letter.
""In failing to uphold their responsibilities to vet their supply chains, these companies may be complicit in the mass repression of Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups,"" he said.
The firms Menendez mentioned did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The United Nations estimates more than a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps in Xinjiang in recent years. China denies it violates Uighur rights and says the camps are designed to stamp out terrorism and provide vocational skills.
Menendez, who has called for sanctions on China over the issue, also requested information about U.S. government contractors who source cotton from China, which produces 84% of its cotton in Xinjiang.
""The use of materials that are manufactured using forced labor is unacceptable for products in U.S. markets,"" he said in the letter.
An Australian think tank said in a report earlier this month that tens of thousands of ethnic Uighurs have been transferred to work in factories across China supplying 83 global brands in conditions ""that strongly suggest forced labor.""
On Monday, the Washington-based Fair Labor Association, which conducts due diligence for major multinational firms, said it was ""deeply troubled by credible reports of forced labor and other violations of fundamental rights in Xinjiang."""

A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc . asset manager who correctly predicted last year’s rally in stocks says the equity market is overly complacent about the possible damage from the coronavirus and could face more declines.
“We don’t think the stock market has priced in the worst outcome of the virus as containment measures may continue to extend, reflecting what we’ve seen in China and Italy,” Shoqat Bunglawala, who heads the global portfolio solutions group for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an interview. “So we recognize there are still downside risks from here.”
Goldman’s global portfolio solutions group cut its exposure to global equities to neutral from overweight in recent weeks as the virus quickly spread outside China, hitting Europe and the U.S., threatening global growth and crimping earnings. The investment unit is keeping its overweight position in fixed income and allocating to such alternative strategies as trend-following, taking a long position in rates and a short position in stocks.
The $1 trillion fund manager is the latest among major investors and strategists to turn cautious on risk assets in the face of growing uncertainty. While the combination of coronavirus fears and an oil price war has wiped out as much as $11 trillion from the MSCI All-Country World Index, equities are coming down from record highs and U.S. stock valuations are still above their historical average. This is making some market players worried that more losses are possible.
“Essentially, we’re getting a shock to profits and we entered this period when valuations were already quite high,” said Bunglawala. “If this virus continues to spread and containment measures are prolonged and extend further, that’s clearly going to have more of an impact on global growth and earnings.”
Major companies, including Apple Inc ., BASF SE  and Adidas AG , have warned about the profit hit as a lockdown in Italy and canceled flights across the world hurt sectors such as luxury and travel. Goldman now expects earnings per share growth in the U.S. to be zero to 2% this year and forecasts an EPS contraction of 6% for Europe.
Bunglawala says that economic data are going to be too delayed to reflect the full extent of damage from the epidemic, so it’s very important to track other factors, such as the speed of the spread of the virus, containment measures and signs of stress in financial markets.
Anticipation is rising for global monetary and fiscal officials to step up their support for the economy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England have already cut interest rates. However, according to Bunglawala, the already low rates limit the scope of potential monetary responses and government leaders might need to come up with their own fiscal measures.
U.S. President Donald Trump is currently pursuing an economic stimulus plan, which may include a payroll tax holiday. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government is ready to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures and the U.K. on Wednesday announced total fiscal stimulus of 30 billion pounds ($39 billion).
While Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s global portfolio solutions group is currently cautious on equities, it is monitoring the virus outbreak and the market for entry points."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials met Wednesday with U.S. technology industry officials to discuss tech-related response efforts to combat the coronavirus outbreak and ways for government to collaborate with the private sector.
COVID19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed about 30 people in the United States, and infected more than 1,000 Americans and over 115,000 people globally.
U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios discussed the planned release of a new database of full-text coronavirus-related scholarly literature and urged tech firms to use tools like ""artificial intelligence, to help medical researchers glean scientific insights from this collection of articles,"" the White House said.
""Cutting edge technology companies and major online platforms will play a critical role in this all-hands-on-deck effort,"" he said.
The companies taking part - by teleconference - included Amazon.com Inc , Apple Inc , Cisco Systems ,  Facebook Inc  , Alphabet  Inc s Google,  IBM  , Microsoft , and Twitter, the White House said. Numerous U.S. health and other federal agencies also participated, either in person or teleconference.
Other topics discussed at the meeting included increased coordination to improve information sharing, identification of best practices to root out misinformation and the tech community s efforts around remote work and telehealth, the White House said.
White House officials are meeting members from the airline, financial and healthcare industries to discuss ways to contain the impact from the spread of the virus.
But those efforts stand in contrast with the White House ordering federal health officials to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified - an unusual step that has restricted information and hampered the U.S. government’s response to the contagion."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The deep declines in the U.S. stock market over coronavirus fears the last three weeks have left a dent in retirement portfolios and brokerage accounts, costing on average each person in the United States around $16,000 as of Monday s close before a rebound Tuesday erased some of those losses.
Americans are mostly exposed to stocks via their 401(k) retirement plans. 
That does not account for wealth disparity and spread of ownership of stock. According to an analysis of 2016 Federal Reserve data by Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, 84% of stocks owned by U.S. households are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. 
Here is a breakdown of stock ownership and how much risk ordinary investors face: 
WHY ARE AMERICANS SO EXPOSED TO THE STOCK MARKET?
The U.S. retirement system no longer relies on defined benefit pension plans - which pay out a guaranteed amount until death. That means that people are mostly in charge of their own retirement, investing via 401(k) plans. 
It also means financial pain is personal. When the market fell 7.6% on Monday, the average person became poorer by $5,682, according to calculations by S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt. 
Around 42% of the working-age population with a full-time job has a 401(k) or similar plan, and those funds are overwhelmingly invested in stocks, according to U.S. Census data. 
According to the Investment Company Institute there are $5.9 trillion in assets in 401(k) plans overall, with $3.8 trillion in mutual funds. According to Morningstar, $1.7 trillion is invested in target-date funds which have a target on when a person retires and are typically heavily weighted to stocks. 
WHY THE FOCUS ON STOCKS?
Investors - either through their own choosing or through target-date funds or on the suggestions of financial advisers - focus heavily on stocks because they can pay rich rewards. Stocks have returned an average of 10.5% a year since 1970, according to Morningstar. 
That is greater than the 8.3% annual return on bonds over the same time according to Morningstar. Bonds, meanwhile, are unlikely to post the same returns in the future because yields, which move lower as prices rise, are at historic lows. 
WHAT DO PEOPLE OWN OUTSIDE THEIR PENSIONS?
Overall, individual stock ownership in the United States appears to be declining as more members of the outsized Baby Boom generation retire or shift their portfolio to a more conservative stance in preparation for retirement. 
Approximately 55% of Americans reported that they owned stock in April 2019, down from the average 62% who reported owning equities in surveys conducted between 2001 and 2008, according to Gallup data. 
However, the popularity of exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to bet on a trend or sector, has surged. There was $4.42 trillion in ETFs listed in the United States overall at the end of 2019, according to ETGI. That has grown by an average of 18.8% a year over the last 10 years. 
Individuals who own stocks outside of their retirement plans often focus on popular large-cap names such as Walt  Disney  Co ,  Microsoft Corp  , and Amazon.com Inc , according to data from TD Ameritrade. Those who opt for exchange-traded funds often gravitate toward those that invest based on a theme, such as marijuana or automation, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Q3L4BT)
WHAT CAN INVESTORS DO?
Overall, investors pulled $13.6 billion out of funds that hold U.S. equities last week, the sharpest pullback from the domestic stock market since September, according to ICI data. 
During Monday s market rout, individual investors turned to technology companies such as Apple Inc , Microsoft, and Amazon, according to data from Fidelity. Walt Disney, meanwhile, had more than 5,000 buy orders through the brokerage firm compared with 1,094 sell orders. 
""It s really about finding ports in the storm right now,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust   Wealth Management.
WHAT DID PEOPLE DO AFTER THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRASH?
Worker participation in 401(k) accounts fell by 3 percentage points between 2007 and 2009, during which the United States suffered the deepest recession since the Great Depression, according to a 2015 study in the Journal of Pension Economics and Finance.
Savings rates among those who continued contributing to their plans, meanwhile, fell by 5 percentage points. Those changes in contribution rates are likely to lower the 401(k) balance of a typical 30-year-old by 8% by the time they reach the age of 62, the study found. 
HOW DOES THE STOCK MARKET FALL AFFECT THE ECONOMY?
Slightly more than half of all U.S. households have any exposure to the stock market. Those people may feel less inclined to make big purchases during a prolonged market rout. In addition, the larger concern for the economy now is that the pullback in travel combined with a collapse of oil prices will sink business and consumer confidence and lead to a recession. 
""It s very hard to tell people to stick to their plans and don t be emotional because it s money, and everyone is emotional about money,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.

The former British colony was rocked by months of sometimes violent protests from last June, triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
The U.S. State Department said in a report on Wednesday that significant human rights issues in the Chinese-ruled city included police brutality against protesters, interference with the right of peaceful assembly and restrictions on political participation.
Hong Kong s government said the police were duty bound to take appropriate action, including the use of necessary force, in the face of violence that endangered public order.
""The degree and extent of violence committed by radical protesters was unprecedented in Hong Kong, and it has seriously endangered people s personal safety, public order and security,"" the city s government said in a statement.
Safeguarding human rights and freedoms was a constitutional duty, it added.
""The government attaches the utmost importance to and is firmly committed to upholding human rights and various freedoms in Hong Kong.”
The U.S. State Department, in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practises, noted examples of police brutality against protesters including on Aug. 31 when police ""rushed onto a subway train and beat several individuals while making arrests"".
On press freedom, the State Department cited many journalists as saying they were harassed, detained or assaulted while covering the protests, while the house of democracy activist Jimmy Lai, who is also an outspoken critic of Beijing and owner of the Apple  Daily newspaper, was attacked.
The State Department also referred to vandalism on the part of protesters, including damage to the office of China s official news agency, Xinhua, in November.
The city government said freedom of speech and freedom of peaceful assembly were ""not absolute"".
""The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that restrictions might be imposed by law if this is necessary to protect, amongst others, national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others,” it said.
The unrest in Hong Kong developed into calls for greater democracy, fueled by worries about the erosion of rights guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula imposed when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The city government said universal suffrage was an ultimate aim but it needed dialogue in an atmosphere of peace and mutual trust leading to consensus."

PARIS (Reuters) - France s competition watchdog is set to fine iPhone maker Apple Inc  next Monday over anti-competitive behaviour in its distribution and sales network, two sources close to the matter said on Thursday. 
One of the sources said the competition authority will give a decision on the matter on Monday, confirming an earlier report by online news website Politico Europe. 
The two sources did not elaborate further on the content or the size of the fine. The French competition authority declined to comment. 
From her appointment as the head of the French antitrust watchdog, Isabelle de Silva has set her sights on U.S. tech giants, including Alphabet Inc s  Google, fined 150 million euros ($167 million) for opaque advertising rules.
Apple mentioned in its latest annual report that France s competition authority was alleging that aspects of the its sales and distribution practices were violating French competition law, which it denies. 
The French consumer watchdog DGCCRF said earlier this year that the California-based company agreed to pay 25 million euros ($28 million) for failing to inform iPhone users that updates of the operating system could slow down the functioning of the device.

Nearly 20% of Broadcom s revenue in 2019 came from Apple Inc , which was the first big technology company to say the epidemic was hurting its production and demand in China.
Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan downplayed reports about one of its wireless chip units coming up for sale.
""We have come to the conclusion that continuing to invest in and operate our wireless assets will create the most value for our business and for our shareholders,"" Tan said on a conference call with analysts.
The Wall Street Journal had reported in December that Broadcom is working with  Credit Suisse   to sell its radio frequency segment in a process that is at an early stage.
Tan said the company will supply radio frequency components for next three generations of 5G phones for its top customer, which analysts believe to be Apple.
VIRUS IMPACT
Tan said Broadcom s supply chain was not impacted to any ""meaningful level"" due to the outbreak, but there was a slowdown in demand.
""There is no doubt COVID-19 has created a high level of uncertainty, which we can t help but think is going to have an impact on our semiconductor business, in particular, in the second half of the fiscal year,"" he said.
The chipmaker said it expects second-quarter revenue of $5.7 billion, plus or minus $150 million, below analysts  average estimate of $5.94 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net revenue rose 1.2% to $5.86 billion in the first quarter, below expectations of $6 billion.
Excluding items, Broadcom reported a profit of $5.25 per share, while analysts were expecting $5.33 per share.

Apple had announced the shuttering of its branded stores in early February.
China placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Lunar New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February.

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets bounced sharply at the opening on Friday as participants took heart from announcements of more emergency support measures out of Europe to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The bounce also reflected a more sanguine assessment of central bank measures to unblock markets that had shown signs of increasing stress and vanishing liquidity during Thursday’s rout.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1,317 points, or 6.2%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 6.0%.
In addition to the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a $1.5 trillion liquidity injection Thursday, the Chinese, Australian, Indonesian, Swedish and Norwegian central banks all announced further measures to stabilize local financial markets on Friday.
They were followed by even more dramatic announcements in Europe, as Germany pledged an unlimited credit facility through its state-owned development bank to companies that suffer cash-flow difficulties as a result of the outbreak. Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission signaled that it was ready to suspend its rules on fiscal deficits given the extraordinary circumstances.
In the U.S., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters late on Thursday that a deal with the Trump administration on a package of economic support measures was “near”. However, President Donald Trump’s Twitter feed indicated that there were still substantial differences between the administration and House Democrats over which measures should be deployed.
“If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31,” Trump said. “Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!”
Trump had pushed back earlier in the week against Democrat proposals for expanded sick pay and unemployment benefits to be included in the package.
Among individual companies, Apple  stock rebounded 6.5% after saying all its stores in China were now open again.

(Reuters) - Wall Street clawed back some losses on Friday after its biggest one-day decline in three decades, as investors set their hopes on more global fiscal stimulus to stem a coronavirus-driven global recession.
All three main indexes jumped more than 6% in early trading before paring gains on reports President Donald Trump was set to declare a national emergency to contain the spread of the deadly pathogen.
The indexes were still about 25% below record highs hit in mid-February, and were on track for their biggest weekly declines since October 2008, the height of the financial crisis.
The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will pass a coronavirus economic aid package on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, but it was unclear whether Trump and his fellow Republicans would support it.
Given the steep declines on Thursday - the biggest one-day percentage drop since ""Black Monday"" in October 1987 - investors were hoping for a stronger bounce-back in today s session. 
""We should have seen significantly more volume, significantly more positive price action, breadth in the market today given the sell-off that we saw specifically yesterday,"" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny’s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York.

All the main S&P 500 sub-indexes were trading higher, with financial stocks (SPSY) rising 6.94% as expectations of further liquidity measures by the Federal Reserve pushed up Treasury yields, in what has become a very thin market.
Oil also looked set to end the week with a silver lining, as both Brent  and WTI crude  settled higher after a near-collapse in prices on Monday due to a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) added 1.66%.
Travel stocks, hammered in the rout, were trading higher, with the S&P 1500 airlines index  up 3.66% 
Hotel operators Marriott International Inc ,  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings  and  Hyatt Hotels Corp   all gained at least 1%.
 Boeing Co   jumped 7.98% but was still on track for its biggest weekly drop in its history on rising concerns about the company s growing cash burn. 
Apple Inc  rose 4.97% and was among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow, as the iPhone maker said it would reopen all 42 of its branded stores in China.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

CHINA NEW INFECTIONS FALLING
While infections continue to climb around the world, in mainland China the number of new cases is falling.
The number of new coronavirus cases imported into mainland China from overseas surpassed the number of locally transmitted new infections for the first time on Friday, data released by the National Health Commission showed on Saturday.
Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those - all in the virus epicenter of Hubei province - were locally transmitted.
Hubei has now seen new infections fall for nine straight days. All four of the new cases on Friday, down from five a day earlier, were in provincial capital Wuhan.
The flu-like virus has infected 80,824 people in mainland China, the commission said.

DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) on Sunday said it plans to cut capital spending in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, and also posted a plunge in profit for last year, missing forecasts in its first earnings announcement as a listed company.
Saudi Arabia s decision last year to float shares in its state oil company - the most profitable company in the world - was one of the central elements in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman s program for economic and political reform.
The record-setting IPO was touted as making the world s biggest energy exporter more professional and transparent. 
The 21% decline in net profit for last year means it fell short of analysts  forecasts for the period that culminated in the share sale, months before the coronavirus pandemic became a factor for oil prices.
In recent weeks, Riyadh has announced that it is ramping up production in an oil price war with Russia that has sent global prices plunging and contributed to the coronavirus rout on international financial markets.
The company said it expects capital spending for 2020 to be between $25 billion and $30 billion in light of current market conditions and recent commodity price volatility, compared to $32.8 billion in 2019.
Aramco has already taken steps to ""rationalize"" its planned 2020 capital spending, CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement.
""The recent COVID-19 outbreak and its rapid spread illustrate the importance of agility and adaptability in an ever-changing global landscape,"" he said.
Aramco listed its shares in Riyadh in December in a record $29.4 billion initial public offering that valued it at $1.7 trillion. Its shares fell below the IPO price last week for the first time, as oil prices crashed after the collapse of an output deal between OPEC and non-OPEC members. Oil prices have fallen nearly 50% from highs reached in January and had their biggest one-day decline on March 9 since the 1991 Gulf War. 
Brent crude futures last traded at $33.85 per barrel on Friday, down from about $64 when Aramco listed its shares.
CASH FLOW
Saudi Arabia s strategy to gain market share by flooding the markets with cheap oil has revived investor concerns that the profitability of the company would come second to government-led strategies to influence oil markets.
""Foreign investors may view recent events as confirmation that the strategic direction of Aramco is driven by its majority shareholder, driven by national development and geopolitics, not simply value maximization of this company s returns,” said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer.
Despite a drop in income, Aramco said it paid a dividend of $73.2 billion in 2019 and intends to declare a cash dividend of $75 billion in 2020, paid quarterly. 
Aramco, which is 98% owned by the Gulf kingdom, reported a net profit of $88.2 billion in 2019, down from $111.1 in 2018. 
Analysts had expected Aramco to post a net profit of 346.6 billion riyals ($92.6 billion) in 2019, according to an estimate of 15 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Aramco said the drop in earnings was mainly due ""lower crude oil prices and production volumes, coupled with declining refining and chemical margins, and a $1.6 billion impairment associated with Sadara Chemical Co.""
""Assuming the price of $35 per barrel, Aramco s revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) could contract by 20-30% compared to our previous forecasts and to the company s performance in 2018-2019,"" said energy analyst Dmitry Marinchenko at Fitch Ratings. 
Biraj Borkhataria, a London-based energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said a $10 a barrel change in prices hits Aramco s cash flow from operations (CFFO) by $15 billion, while each 100,000 barrels change in output impacts CFFO by $1.1 billion, assuming a price of $60 per barrel. ""Lower price more than trumps higher production volumes,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia has long acted as the global oil market s swing producer, the only country capable of substantially and rapidly cutting or raising output to match demand and prop up prices.
Aramco could easily fund the dividend for minority shareholders, which own 1.7% of the company, even if oil prices slump to $10-$20 a barrel as the share of minorities is about $1.3 billion, said RBC s Borkhataria.
Aramco remains the world s most profitable company, beating Western oil majors such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp , and Apple Inc , which made $55 billion in its last financial year that ended in September.
Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital, said that despite the economic headwinds and low oil prices, Aramco will be able to maintain ""good dividends"" at a Brent crude price of $40 or even $20 per barrel.

Aramco said it had total hydrocarbon production of 13.2 million barrels per day of oil equivalent in 2019, compared to 13.6 million barrels per day of oil equivalent in 2018. Aramco shares were flat at 29 riyals at 0845 GMT, 9% below the IPO price if 32 riyals."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Major energy companies in the United States imposed work-from-home rules for office staff and began health checks for remote or critical workers as coronavirus spread and threatened an industry reeling from falling demand and profits. 
 BP  ,  Exxon Mobil  ,  Kinder Morgan , Motiva Enterprises and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) told most office staff to work from home starting Monday. Federal regulators on Friday were pressed by companies to ease work rules for pipeline operators and to limit visits to some sites. Shell and  Chevron   began health checks of workers and visitors at some key U.S. facilities, spokesmen said.
Offshore rigs, refineries and pipelines require on-site teams and group workers in close quarters, making them vulnerable in a Covid-19 outbreak. They cannot be run remotely and health checks could prevent forced shutdowns that could lead to big losses or local fuel shortages. 
The pandemic has infected more than 156,000 people worldwide including some 2,900 people in the United States, killed more than 5,800 globally and slashed fuel demand amid shuttered schools, churches, offices and some retail stores.
There is only one known case of Covid-19 to hit a U.S. refinery. Marathon Petroleum Corp , the nation s largest refiner by capacity, removed some staff at a California plant after an employee became ill. Norwegian oil firm Equinor halted a North Sea development project and removed staff after an offshore worker fell ill.
STORM-LIKE PREPARATIONS
Falling oil demand and a price-war that slashed crude prices by about 50% this year has put the industry in a tailspin. Many oil firms have abruptly cut spending and staff to cope with the downturn.
Work-at-home rules, fewer car and plane trips are expected to reduce U.S. petroleum demand by up to 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd). For the full year, it could cut motor fuel use by roughly 300,000 to 400,000 bpd. 
There have been no refining or chemical plant shut-ins caused by coronavirus. Still, companies are drafting plans similar to hurricane measures that keep plants running with minimal staff, said people familiar with operations. 
Shell asked salaried staff at its Louisiana refineries to begin shadowing hourly plant operators to prepare managers to run units if necessary, the people said. 
Exxon will allow only trained operators into control rooms at its Baytown plant, and they must remain at least six feet apart from one another, they added.
Pipeline regulators discussed work-rules for control room operators and visits by U.S. and state inspectors with trade group executives on Friday, said Suzanne Lemieux, an emergency expert at trade group American Petroleum Institute. 
SWEEPING PRECAUTIONS 
BP and Shell on Friday gave workers work-at-home assignments following similar social-distancing measures at Apple , Facebook , and Microsoft s Silicon Valley offices. The rules affect about 15,000 U.S. Shell workers. 
Shell has begun screening staff who travel to its U.S. Gulf of Mexico production rigs ""to ensure that we minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission"" to offshore workers, said spokesman Curtis Smith.
The sweeping precautions affect refinery, oil and gas export terminal and gas pipeline operations. Kinder Morgan Inc , one of the largest North American pipeline firms, asked most of its 11,000 employees to work from home beginning Monday. It will reevaluate the situation weekly, said spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz. 
Non-essential workers at BP s U.S. refineries, Exxon’s Baytown, Texas, refinery and Shell’s Convent and Norco, Louisiana, plants also will work from home beginning Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. BP may keep the measures through mid-April, one of the people said. 
Exxon would not comment on specific actions. It is focused ""on ensuring the safety and health of our entire workforce and to do our part to limit the spread,"" said spokesman Todd Spitler.
Marathon Petroleum launched ""business-continuity plans to accommodate staffing needs in the event of illness-related absenteeism,” spokesman Jamal Kheiry said. 
Among measures being weighed at refineries are assigning small crews to keep plants during an outbreak, the people said. Crews would not leave until the crisis passed. 
Most refineries can operate with about half their normal staff, the people said, but may have to scale back production.
Refiners  LyondellBasell Industries   and Chevron are considering health checks for employees as they begin their workday, said people familiar with the deliberations.
""We are taking precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure, including screening workers and visitors,"" Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said. Local offices will set their own rules with health officials, he added.

SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple is taking the temperature of customers at its China stores, Australian grocer Woolworths is providing dedicated shopping hours for the elderly and Samsung will use thermal imaging to vet shareholders at its annual meeting.
Companies across Asia are taking novel and sometimes drastic steps to implement ""social distancing"" measures to try slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 170,00 globally and killed more than 6,500.
Australian casino operators, and rivals,  Crown  Resorts  and Star Entertainment  announced plans to take half their electronic gaming machines and table offline to ensure their customers got some space.
As well as switching off every second machine, the pair are restricting the number of players at both sitting and stand-up table games.
The potential hit to revenues from the measure, following a downturn in high rollers from China, weighed heavily on their shares. Crown dropped 10.5%, while Star shed a fifth, outpacing a 7.4% fall in the broader market (AXJO).
The casino changes were in line with Australian government advice issued a day earlier that recommended no non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people be held. Australia has recorded more than 250 cases, including Hollywood star Tom Hanks.
Woolworths , one of the country s two major grocers, introduced a shopping hour for the elderly and those with disabilities.
""This temporary measure will give (the elderly), and those with a disability, the opportunity to shop before ​our stores officially open - helping them obtain the ​essential ​items they need most in a less crowded environment,"" Woolworths Supermarkets Managing Director Claire Peters said.
In South Korea, Samsung Electronics  (KS:005930) on Monday urged shareholders to vote electronically for its annual general meeting later this week, the first time the company has adopted this measure.
The tech giant said there would be thermal cameras and contactless thermometers for those attending the meeting in person and people with symptoms may be restricted from entering. Compatriot SK Hynix (KS:000660), which also holds its AGM this week, plans to seat shareholders about two meters away from each other, a spokesman told Reuters.
In the Philippines, Samuel Matunog, president of ICT Davao an umbrella organization for 56 call center companies, said it had asked agents ""not to hold hands and avoid cheek-to-cheek kisses.""
Community quarantine was implemented in Davao and some other areas in Philippines on Sunday, a move that suspended classes, imposed time-based curfews, and banned drinking in public places.
CHINA EASING
As many countries imposed tougher ""social distancing"" rules, China began easing its own curbs across stores, restaurants and offices after weeks of industry-wide shutdowns.
Apple Inc  reopened its 42 stores in mainland China while closing others elsewhere in the world, but required customers wear masks and have their temperatures taken upon entry.
An Apple store in one of Shanghai s busiest shopping streets was buzzing on Saturday despite the restrictions, following a slump in sales last month..
The company has also moved its annual developers conference in California in June entirely online.
Workplaces in China have limited lunchtime interactions for employees and restricted the number of people allowed in elevators. Chains including McDonald s  and Starbucks  ramped up ""contactless"" pickup and delivery services.
Several food delivery companies elsewhere in Asia are adopting the ""zero contact"" approach, including Domino s Pizza  in Australia and New Zealand, Tencent-backed (HK:0700) Swiggy, and in India, Zomato, backed by Alibaba s  Ant Financial."

Treasuries surged and U.S. equity futures tumbled at the start of what’s set to be another volatile week as investors respond to a rapidly escalating economic hit from the coronavirus and a massive emergency move by the Federal Reserve to ease policy.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank along with Asian shares, while futures on the S&P 500 Index hit trading limits with a decline of almost 5% following Friday’s huge rebound on Wall Street. Benchmark Treasury yields retreated more than 30 basis points at one point, though bonds in Europe were mixed.
While the Fed and other central banks strengthened efforts to stabilize capital markets and liquidity, investors are also reacting to a rapid deterioration in the global economic outlook.  Nike  Inc . and Apple Inc . announced mass store closings, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said growth next quarter will be weak.
Investors are struggling to manage a rapidly shifting scenario of companies shutting operations, countries sealing borders and central bankers responding with extraordinary moves. The Fed cut its key interest rate by a full percentage point to near zero and said it will boost its bond holdings by $700 billion. The Bank of Japan move to accelerate asset purchases, at least for a time, bringing forward its decision from later this week.
“In normal circumstances, a large policy response like this would put a floor under risk assets and support a recovery,” Jason Daw, a strategist at  Societe Generale  , wrote in a note. “However, the size of the growth shock is becoming exponential and markets are rightfully questioning what else monetary policy can do and discounting its effectiveness in mitigating coronavirus-induced downside risks.”

The yen rebounded from Friday’s plunge after the Fed and five counterparts also said they would deploy foreign-exchange swap lines. Australian equities fell almost 10%, the most since 1992 even after the Reserve Bank of Australia said it stood ready to buy bonds for the first time -- an announcement that sent yields tumbling. New Zealand’s currency slumped after an emergency rate cut there.

Meantime, China reported Monday that output and retail sales tumbled in the past two months. Oil resumed its trenchant decline."

At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 4.8% lower, futures for the Nasdaq 100 down 4.6%, while the DJI futures contract fell 4.6%. These contracts were suspended after plunging to hit their daily limits, suggesting the cash markets could open even lower.
The Federal Reserve held an emergency meeting Sunday, cutting short-term rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, announcing at least $700 billion in purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in coming weeks and offering cheap dollar financing to financial institutions around the world facing stress in credit markets.
These moves come as governments around the world sought to stem the spread of the virus that has infected over 169,000 people globally and killed more than 6,500.
In the U.S., there have been school closings, runs on grocery stores, shuttered restaurants and retailers, and ends to sports events. 
Shares in United Airlines  dropped over 16% in premarket trading after the company said it’s slashing its flight schedule by 50% for the next two months, seeing revenue in March down $1.5 billion from last year. Shares in American Airlines  and Delta Airlines  are also sharply lower.
Shares in Apple  fell over 11% in premarket trading after announcing it is closing all of its stores outside greater China until at least March 27. This matches the response of a number of retailers, including  Nike   and Urban Outfitters .
Shares in cruise operator Carnival  dropped over 20% premarket after it cancelled all its North American cruise lines for at least a month, amid a drop in global demand for holidays due to the spread of coronavirus.
Elsewhere, the oil market has been hammered by the combination of a hit to demand from the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the globe’s largest producers.

PARIS (Reuters) - France s competition watchdog on Monday fined iPhone maker Apple  1.1 billion euros ($ 1.23 billion), saying it was guilty of anti-competitive behavior towards its distribution and retail network. 
The fine, the biggest ever levied by the French antitrust body, comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on U.S. tech giants by European regulators, who have been delving into the firms  powerful market position, the tax they pay, and how they protect consumers  privacy.
Apple said it would appeal the watchdog s ruling, which it said was at odds with legal precedent in France. 
In its decision, the French regulator said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the Internet. 
The watchdog said Apple s two wholesalers in France fully followed the U.S. company s instructions on how to allocate its products to customers, instead of freely determining their commercial policy. 
""Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete with each other and to prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products,"" the watchdog said in a statement. 
The two wholesalers, Tech Data and Ingram Micro, were fined 76 million and 63 million euros respectively, the authority said. Tech Data had no immediate comment to make and Ingram Micro could not immediately be reached.
""The French competition authority’s decision is disheartening,"" Apple said in a statement announcing it planned to appeal. 
""It relates to practices from over a decade ago and discards 30 years of legal precedent that all companies in France rely on with an order that will cause chaos for companies across all industries.""

Since her nomination as the head of the French competition authority in 2016, Isabelle de Silva has set her sights on U.S. tech companies, including Alphabet  Inc s Google, which was fined 150 million euros ($167 million) for opaque advertising rules."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell the most since 1987 in early trading on Monday, having been suspended, limit down, almost immediately after trading started, as the shutdown of increasing swathes of public life in the U.S. brought home the scale of the coronavirus outbreak.
By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2,773 points or 12% at 20,393 points. The S&P 500 was indicated down 10.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 11.5%.
Investors weren’t reassured by the emergency measures taken on Sunday night by the Federal Reserve, which cut the target range for fed funds to near zero and signalled $700 billion in asset purchases to keep financial markets orderly.
The Fed also said it would extend the availability of dollars internationally through swap facilities with other central banks.
""The Fed has pulled out all the stops. But in the end the underlying driver of this crisis is very different from 2008/9, i.e. this is about COVID-19,"" said Robin Brooks, an economist with the Institute for International Finance in Washington, DC. ""That means the Fed can alleviate the symptoms, but it s unreasonable to expect the crisis to go away on Fed action.""
Earlier on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged investors to look beyond the short-term hit to the economy, telling CNBC that ""There will be a huge amount of pent up demand when this is done. And it will be done.”
However, Mnuchin also warned that ""the goal is not to bail out companies,” a line that appeared to raise the risk of near-term bankruptcies, especially in the transport and oil sectors.
Among the worst hit were airline stocks. United Airlines stock fell over 15% after saying it would slash capacity by 50%, while Delta Air Lines   stock and American Airlines  stock also fell heavily after the Trump administration expanded restrictions on arrivals from Europe to include the key routes serving London and Dublin.
Apple  stock fell as much as 13% before rebounding to be down only 9.7% after the company said it will shut all its stores outside China. It was also hit by a $1.2 billion antitrust fine in France.
Oil and gas stocks tumbled again as crude prices fell below $30 a barrel and U.S. gasoline prices fell to an all-time low of 69 cents a gallon.
Banks were also badly hit, as the Fed s action threatened to crush lending margins without, at least in the short term, supporting income from currency and securities markets. Bank of America  stock fell 14.6%, while JPMorgan  stock fell 15.1% and Citigroup   stock fell 19.7%.
Casino operators MGM Resorts  and Wynn Resorts   also both fell after the pair announced they would temporarily close their casinos in Las Vegas, essentially putting much of the famous strip under lockdown.

Investing.com – Wall Street moved off session lows on Monday as the Federal Reserve pumped more liquidity into the market just a day after slashing rates and reverting to its financial-crisis-era bond-buying program in an attempt to keep a lid on the economic damaged from the Covid-19 outbreak.  
The S&P 500 slipped 6.91%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 7.31% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.8%, or 1,800 points, though had fallen by as many as 2,800 points at the lows.
The New York Fed said midday Monday it would conduct a $500 billion repo operation this afternoon in a bid to shore up short-term funding markets and avert a liquidity squeeze.
The move comes a day after the Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate by 100 bps to a range of 0% to 0.25%.
The U.S. central bank also offered a number of liquidity-boosting measures, including currency swaps, along with its central banking peers like the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, to make it easier for financial institutions to trade currencies and receive U.S. dollars.
The wave of stimulus, however, did little calm investor jitters over the coronavirus-led impact on the economy as the trading was halted earlier in the day after the broader market plunged more than 7%.
The selloff on Wall Street comes at a time when health authorities raised concerns about the lack of testing for the virus in some nations.
""We have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response,"" the World Health Organization said."

Investing.com – The Dow suffered its biggest one-day points plunge ever on Monday and the second-biggest percentage drop as a wave of late selling hit Wall Street after President Donald Trump said the worst of the outbreak could last through the summer and that it was not currently under control.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.97%, or 2,997.10 points. The S&P 500 lost 11.98%, and Nasdaq Composite lost 12.32%.
In a blow to hopes the Covid-19 pandemic could be contained sooner rather than later, Trump suggested it could continue into July or August. The president also urged Americans to avoid traveling and gathering in public spaces.
Real Estate and energy led the sea of the red on Wall Street, with latter paced by a 9.5% drop in oil prices on fears of a prolonged slump in travel demand amid the virus outbreak.
Airlines, meanwhile, were given a boost after Trump vowed to ""backstop airlines 100%,"" at a time when the industry has come under siege as travel demand continues to drop.
United Airlines  and Delta Air Lines  fell 15% and 6.7% respectively, while American Airlines  surged 11.2%.
Financials were also among the biggest decliners, led by Wall Street banks, several of which detailed plans to scrap share buybacks in order to maintain sufficient capital to keep credit lines open to customers.

The cut would follow a rush by global central banks to loosen settings as policymakers scramble to shore up growth and financial stability as crumbling investor sentiment.
The majority of the 17 economists in a Reuters poll said they expected the central bank to cut the benchmark discount rate  by 12.5 basis points to 1.25% when its policy board meets on Thursday.
The expected move would be the first policy change since the second quarter of 2016 when the bank cut the discount rate.
One economist predicted Taiwan s central bank would cut rates by as much as 50 basis points to a record low of 0.875%, which was the low end of the range of poll estimates.
Six others predicted a 25-point cut that would lower the policy rate to 1.125%, while two economists predicted no change at 1.375%.
Taiwan s manufacturers are a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple  and some have been hit by factory disruptions in China and slowing electronics demand from the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan, whose largest trading partner is China, cut its estimate for 2020 economic growth to 2.37% last month, citing the threat from the outbreak.
The central bank warned last week the outbreak would have a longer impact than previously thought and a ""combination"" of both fiscal and monetary policy would be more effective in dealing with the virus impact.
The island is rolling out a T$60 billion ($2 billion) stimulus package to help soften the impact of the virus on the economy and President Tsai Ing-wen has said a further T$40 billion was available.
While Taiwan has only reported 67 cases of the virus, compared with more than 80,800 in neighboring China, it is on a war-footing to prevent its further spread, and has suspended visits to the island for most Chinese visitors."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, its latest move to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
The change does not mean Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or that sellers have to ship directly to consumers.
The move reflects how the global spread of the virus has created challenges for retailers, from supply chain to delivery.
In a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to ""quickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.""
Amazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well.
""We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,"" Amazon said in a statement.
The company said the new protocol applies to its retail inventory as well as to the products of third-party sellers on its platform.
The move follows Amazon s Monday announcement that it will hire 100,000 more workers, as the world s largest online retailer is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.
LESS AD REVENUE?
The news may hurt demand for lucrative services that Amazon offers to merchants, like advertising.
Amy Roskelley, owner of Utah-based Health Beet, said she pays Amazon around $1,000 a month to promote her flatware products that help consumers portion their meals. Now that she can’t add inventory to Amazon’s warehouses, she plans to cut ad spend in half.
“It’s hard for me to justify spending money if I don’t have enough inventory to fill” customers’ orders, she said.
Roskelley is considering other ways to reduce her dependence on Amazon, too, whether shipping directly to customers or driving traffic to her own website.
""I have been concerned that they ll shut down Amazon’s warehouses and won’t ship out at all, and that would just devastate me,"" she said.
Amazon has yet to indicate any such closures. Still, the months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the Seattle e-commerce company s operations.
Merchant Zengxie Pang said Amazon s change came just as the China-based seller s factories had resumed production.
""Now we can t ship to warehouses until April,"" Pang said. ""We are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies, and they will likely run out of stock.""
Chief executive of personal massager company LuLu, Michael Gawrychowski, said his supplier in China woke him in the middle of the night with news of Amazon s change.
""People are freaking out,"" he said. Gawrychowski immediately sent a request for a 25,000-unit shipment. That was rejected, but a second request went through, he said.
Amazon s two-day shipping guarantee has in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday s announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon s business.
""This change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay , Wish, Walmart , Facebook  Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,"" Sebastian said.
Customer searches for popular items including iPhone cases, AirPods and Apple  Watch bands have fallen from the week prior, an indication of shifting shopper interests, according to research from Helium 10, which provides tools to sellers.
Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses have been furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus, and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession.
For sellers, which account for over half of sales on Amazon, the new warehouse policy only adds to the economic uncertainty they are facing, said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As shops shut their doors across Europe and the United States, in China the sharp drop in new coronavirus cases has encouraged consumers to venture back into malls and restaurants - for the most part quite gingerly but occasionally in throngs.
Helping consumers return has been a loosening of quarantine and other restrictions on business and social activity. Restaurants that have satisfied authorities with plans for curbing the risk of infection are now allowed to serve groups of diners and most stores have reopened, though big brands like IKEA and Apple Inc  have restrictions on crowds.
After being mostly cooped up at home for weeks, Chen Jiayi, a 21-year-old college student in Shanghai, said it was like coming up for air when she went out on Saturday to buy coffee and cake.
""There were quite a lot of people in the city center, it was a completely different picture from the end of February. There were even queues at the bubble tea and biscuit shops,"" she said.
The epidemic, which has infected more than 80,000 in China and killed over 3,200, had kept hundreds of millions stuck at home since late January. Retail sales for the world s second-largest economy shrank by a fifth in the first two months of 2020 from a year earlier.
But new cases have dropped sharply of late. The number of daily new infections for mainland China fell below 100 for the first time on March 6 and on Tuesday, there were just 13, down from 21 a day earlier and almost all involving travelers from abroad.
Getting Chinese consumer spending back on its feet again soon is seen as imperative for the health of the domestic economy and the many people whose livelihoods depend on the retail and restaurant sectors.
It is also key for many international brands that have already seen first-quarter earnings dented by the outbreak in China and are bracing for tumbling sales in western markets.
For some big popular brands, the response to reopening has been encouraging.
Hundreds of shoppers thronged Apple s stores on two main shopping streets in Shanghai over the weekend. IKEA, which opened three of its Beijing stores on March 8, saw high visitor numbers and queues as it implemented new social distancing rules such as only four people per elevator, state media reported.
And hotpot restaurants in the central city of Chongqing, where the dish is much beloved, were inundated with customers after they were allowed to reopen, with reported waiting times of 6 to 8 hours, TV broadcasts showed.
A FRAGILE PSYCHE
That said, the appetite to get out and spend is far from robust and many shops are still quite empty while some restaurants remain shut.
At the upscale Jing an Kerry Centre mall in Shanghai this week, store assistants were arranging stock or looking at their phones amid a dearth of walk-in customers. And at the Gemdale Plaza mall in Beijing, only three of 10 restaurants on its top floor were open at Tuesday lunchtime.
Many Chinese say they remain worried about the possibility of new infections as more people return to work. They are also reluctant to spend much, fretting about job security and potential cuts to wages as the economy struggles.
""This has certainly been a fragile time in the psyche of Chinese consumers with all the fear and anxieties caused by uncertainty and information overflow,"" said Derek Deng, partner at consultancy firm Bain & Company in Shanghai.
To encourage spending, some businesses have embarked on promotions offering discounts or gifts to customers upon reopening. Haidilao (HK:6862), a popular hotpot restaurant chain, gave away bags of soup stock and snacks to diners.
Local authorities in several provinces are also asking Communist Party officials to set an example by spending on food and shopping, and encouraging their friends and family to do the same. Some provinces are handing out coupons to the public to spend on food and books.
A Bain report predicts a post-epidemic consumption recovery will ""largely follow patterns similar"" to the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. Then spending on food and cosmetics saw a quick return to normal while demand for clothing surged beyond pre-epidemic levels.
But just when a full recovery will happen remains unclear.
""Consumer sentiment is still in the process of returning from panic to normal or a new normal,"" said Deng.
It also remains to be seen whether the epidemic will have a long-lasting impact on how consumers shop with some analysts speculating that online ordering and deliveries will become even more entrenched.
Emma Wang, a film producer in Beijing, said she regularly goes outside to walk her dog but does not feel any pent-up need to go shopping amid uncertain economic times.
""Personally, I am not thinking of rushing to the malls now. I have Hema supermarket for all daily essentials delivered to my apartment,"" she said, referring to  Alibaba  Group Holding s  online grocery shopping service.

The purchase caps come just after the hardware maker closed all of its brick-and-mortar stores outside China, as the coronavirus spreads globally and forces lockdowns and limitations on public movement to contain it. 
Checks on Apple s website reveal that in numerous countries, a drop-down menu prevents customers from buying more than two of the same model iPhone, across all models. The last time it did so was in 2007, when the iPhone was first introduced, to stop people from reselling them.
In mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and Singapore, a message appears above iPhone listings informing customers that purchases will be limited to two devices per order.
Apple declined to comment. 
The purchase limits come as Apple braces for a blow due to the coronavirus  impact on sales, both due to supply chain disruptions and weak demand.
As the illness swept China, Apple closed all of its brick-and-mortar retail outlets in the country, only reopening all of them by March 13. Foxconn (TW:2317), its most important manufacturing partner, temporarily halted operations, though founder Terry Gou has said that production has now returned to normal.
In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote a letter warning investors the company would unlikely meet its initial revenue projections for the its calendar Q1 earnings guidance due to the virus.
Now, while China s factories have resumed operations, Apple and other hardware companies face weakening demand as the countries around the world shutter retail stores and enforce social distancing.
The coronavirus, which originated in China in late December, has since spread to 178 countries, infecting over 240,000 and killing about 10,000 globally.
On March 13, Apple announced that all of its Apple Stores outside of China would shut down to fight the spread of the virus.
According to Nicole Peng, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Canalys, Apple is likely limiting online orders to prevent scalpers from stockpiling devices and re-selling them on the grey market.
""This happened in the past in Asia when there is a new iPhone launch and scalpers saw an opportunity to sell to mainland China, where the new phones were harder to buy at the time,"" she said. 
""Now that stores all over the world are closed, online scalpers see a similar opportunity.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore launched a contact-tracing smartphone app to allow authorities to identify those who have been exposed to people infected with coronavirus as part of efforts to curb the spread of the disease.
Governments around the world have turned to technology to battle the virus.
The TraceTogether app will work by exchanging short distance Bluetooth signals between phones to detect other participating users in close proximity of 2 meters. 
Records of the encounters will be stored locally on each phone with the app, developed by Singapore s Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the health ministry.
Users will need to send their logs when requested by the health ministry, which will otherwise not have any knowledge of the data, according to an official statement. 
Singapore has won international praise for its fastidious approach in tackling the virus - which has included using police investigators and security cameras to help track suspect carriers. 
The data stored on users  phones will be encrypted and the app will not access other information, such as a user s location.
""The engineering has preserved the privacy of the users from each other,"" Janil Puthucheary, a senior minister of state, told reporters.
Singapore has stringent rules to deal with infectious diseases - last month it charged a Chinese couple with giving false information about their movements to authorities looking to trace their contacts.

Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is suspending operations until April 14, the company said in a text message to Bloomberg News. It intends to resume India production based on further government announcements. A Wistron representative said the company is also adhering to the order, while declining to comment on exactly what products are affected.
Foxconn and Wistron are key manufacturing partners to many of the world’s largest electronics names. While neither company said which products have been affected, their Indian facilities mainly crank out older iPhone models or produce gadgets primarily aimed at the domestic market.
Wistron’s Chairman Simon Lin said on an earnings call on Wednesday that he believes lockdowns in countries where the company operates, including India and Malaysia, will only be a “short-term” issue as Wistron doesn’t have labor-shortage problems there and production can be resumed quickly once restrictions are lifted.
Still, the closures underscore how Modi’s surprise announcement of a 21-day lockdown -- the most far-reaching measure undertaken by any government to curb the coronavirus pandemic -- may affect the operations of global technology giants in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets for devices.

Investing.com – The Dow notched its first back-to-back wins for the first time in more than two months, despite giving up lots of its gains in late selling Wednesday as lawmakers tussled on Capitol Hill over the U.S. $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, denting hopes of a speedy rollout.
The Dow rose 2.39%, or 495 points, marking its second-straight session of gains for the first time since Feb. 5-6. The Dow had been up more than 1,000 points intraday. The S&P 500 rose 1.15 %, but the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.45%.
Events of Capitol Hill continued to dominate direction as ongoing disagreements over the provisions included in the stimulus package threatens fast-track voting.
Three Republican U.S. Senators, Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham and Ben Sasse said in a joint statement that legislative language included in the bill encouraged layoffs and would need fixes, Reuters reported.
But Sen. Bernie Sanders reportedly has threatened to hold up the vote on the bill and demand new restrictions on companies receiving bailouts unless the three Republican Senators drop their objections to unemployment insurance expansions, Jeffrey Stein at the Washington Post reported.
Companies that take a loan through the stimulus package, however, will be restricted from buying back their stock until one year after the loan is repaid and also will not be allowed to pay any dividends if their loan is outstanding, CNBC reported.
The rally on Wall Street was led by a standout performance from Boeing , up 24%, as investors anticipate virus-hit sectors like aviation will be rescued by the government. Boeing s surge accounted for 210.6 points of the Dow s rally today.  
Energy, meanwhile, was also in demand, driven by a 2% rise in oil prices as U.S. stimulus hopes have helped to offset concerns about falling demand amid the outbreak.
In tech, meanwhile, chip stocks gave back some of their gains from a day earlier, falling 1.6%, paced by a slump in Qualcomm , Micron Technology  and Xilinx .
Micron jumped in after-hours trade, however, after the chipmaker topped second-quarter revenue and earnings estimates.
Apple  fell 1% amid reports the company is preparing for a potential delay of its 5G iPhone lineup expected to be launched this autumn, Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing sources."

(Reuters) - Chipmaker Micron Technology Inc  forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts  estimates on Wednesday and said the shift to work-from-home globally due to the coronavirus outbreak is fueling demand for notebooks and data center services.
Authorities around the world have locked down cities, enforced severe restrictions on travel and encouraged people to stay at home to contain the rapidly spreading virus.
Notebooks that support work-from-home and virtual learning are increasingly in demand, Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said on a post-earnings call with analysts. 
The jump in remote work is also powering a surge in demand for data center services.
Mehrotra said data center business in China was boosted by increased gaming, e-commerce and remote-work activities as the country locked down many cities and regions to combat the outbreak.
The company is moving supply from smartphone to service the strength in data center markets, Mehrotra said, adding the demand could lead to supply shortages. 
Last week,  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) said coronavirus would hurt sales of smartphones and consumer electronics this year, while demand from data centers would fuel a recovery in memory chip markets.
Micron said two of its factories in Malaysia were briefly shut down and is now running production on a limited basis, in compliance with the country s orders.
The company did not provide any updates about production at its U.S. plants, as states impose shut downs to counter the rapidly spreading virus.
Meanwhile, a group representing major semiconductor companies including  Intel Corp   and Micron said on Wednesday it was working with federal officials to make clear to state and local officials overseeing lockdowns that chip companies are essential businesses that should continue operations.
Micron said two of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus, and are receiving medical attention, without specifying the location details.
The Idaho-based company forecast third-quarter revenue in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, the midpoint of which was above analysts  estimates of $4.87 billion.

The company s shares rose 5% in extended trading as the estimate followed warning of sales hit by other semiconductor makers such as Apple  supplier  Skyworks Solutions Inc  . "

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Kat Volpe laid out an exercise mat and tried to sync her iPhone with her big screen TV for a fitness class webcast on Instagram last week during New York s coronavirus lockdown.
But the popular app is incompatible with Google s Chromecast TV-plugin device which is remote controlled with a smartphone or computer.
As stay-at-home orders push workouts, concerts and even happy hours online, Volpe and other consumers are finding that some of the most popular services do not work with products from rivals.
Apps with surging demand for live streaming such as  Zoom Video Communications  Inc  and  Facebook Inc  s  Instagram are among major holdouts in adopting the phone-to-TV casting technology from Alphabet Inc s  Google. Others lacking Chromecast support include Apple Inc s  Apple TV+ subscription video service,  Twitter Inc  s  video offering and Bytedance s video entertainment app TikTok.
""There s a lot of instances where the bigger tech companies don t want to integrate with products from other tech companies,"" said Nadia Gilani, who gave up on a workout when she could not get Instagram to cast to her TV.
Such narrow limits are a disservice to consumers, said Gilani, 26, a tech worker in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""It s a business-minded and not a socially minded way of operating.""
Facebook is exploring putting livestreams on a website which would work with Chromecast if accessed on Google s Chrome browser on a PC. TikTok is considering Chromecast support.
Zoom has no such plans but users who pay for its Zoom Rooms software can use its proprietary casting technology.
Apple declined to comment, but it partners with many TV makers directly to allow beaming video from iPhones. 
Online video services are fighting for subscribers and advertisers, and those not supporting Chromecast may want customers to buy additional products from them. Apple, for instance, sells a device that also makes apps viewable on TV. Reluctance to share more data with Google could be a factor as well.
Google said Chromecast usage rose in recent weeks versus a year ago and that the company continually encourages apps to adopt its free casting software.
Consumer outcry has forced some changes. A year ago, Google agreed to make YouTube available on Amazon.com Inc s  Fire devices, and Amazon s Prime Video app started working with Chromecast devices.
Volpe, the New Yorker live streaming a workout on Instagram from Barry s Bootcamp, said she ended up grabbing her iPhone every couple of minutes to learn each new exercise because it would not prop up anywhere.
""The set-up was a hot mess,"" she said.

Volpe has turned to recorded workouts on Google s YouTube ""just because that s so much easier,"" she said, as it works flawlessly with Google s Chromecast."

China, which saw sales drop 38% in February from a year earlier, is now showing signs of recovery with many stores re-opening in mid-March.
There are also signs of recovery in South Korea, but for other parts of the world, ""the worst is yet to come,"" said Jean Park, a senior analyst at Counterpoint.
Smartphone makers are facing new supply chain disruptions as more countries impose lockdown orders. On Tuesday, Foxconn (TW:2317), one of Apple s key suppliers, said it would suspend operations in India in compliance with government orders.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Thursday, with investors taking a cautious stance ahead of unemployment data which could vividly illustrate the economic damage caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 25 points, or 1.0%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 64 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow futures contract fell 135 points, or 0.6%. 
Following days of wrangling, the bipartisan Senate unanimously passed a stimulus package to the tune of $2 trillion late Wednesday. The fate of the bill now rests with the House of Representatives, and a vote there is not expected until Friday.
The need for this stimulus is likely to be placed into plain view with the release of the weekly jobless claims report, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). This is set to offer the clearest evidence yet of the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. economy. 
A huge number is expected, especially after California’s state governor Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that more than a million people from his state alone had filed for unemployment this month.
“We have already got a few regional initial jobless claims, which unsurprisingly suggest a sharp increase in unemployment, as companies are shutting down and letting people go,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“If jobless claims increase by the same percentage as in Ohio, national claims will increase to above 6 million.""
“Just to give another example, 11% of all employees work in the leisure and hospitality industry (including arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services) and all those jobs are in danger in the current situation,” the bank added.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on NBC television around 700 AM ET, in an unusual appearance, which may provide more information about policymakers  response to the outbreak.
In corporate news, Apple  is in the spotlight amid reports it is thinking of delaying the release of its latest iPhone model given the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Also of interest will be McDonald’s , as the fast-food restaurant chain has decided to pull its all-day breakfast menu as it looks to make things easier for staff during this difficult period.
Additionally, investors are likely to look at Ford  after S&P Global Ratings downgraded the car maker s debt to junk late Wednesday, saying the auto maker s credit metrics and ""competitive position"" were already borderline for an investment-grade rating before the coronavirus outbreak.
Oil headed lower Thursday, still under pressure as the pandemic continues to slow economic growth and oil demand, the latest blow to which came in the shape of India announcing a three-week lockdown earlier this week.
At 7:10  AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.8% lower at $23.80 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $27.07."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lily Reiche has lost nearly half of her dogwalking clients in Los Angeles because of California s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Of the 40 or so accounts at My Dog Spot, which dried up because people are either working from home or have lost income, just five clients are continuing to pay. 
""They all say,  You mean so much to us, this is something we need to do for you, "" Reiche said.
As state and federal governments work on macro solutions for sick pay, unemployment benefits and business bailouts tied to the economic meltdown resulting from the coronavirus, many Americans are faced with a tough financial - and very personal - decision: do you keep caregivers, housekeepers, dogwalkers, gardeners and other workers on the payroll if you do not need their services or if they cannot come to work right now?
There is not much guidance available other than the discussion on social media on figuring out the right thing to do. 
The general consensus is that if you are still getting paid, you keep paying the people in your life as long as you can, even if they are not able to come to work. 
However, the question that ominously remains to be answered: for how long? 
""I think it s pretty universal in terms of the nanny discussion, that if you re still getting paid, that you compensate them,"" said Roger Ma, a certified financial planner in New York. 
Ma has a newborn at home and had just hired a nanny before all of this started. Last week, he handed her four weeks pay in advance and sent her home. Ma is also paying his bi-weekly housekeeper and not having her come. 
But should the coronavirus crisis last for months, Ma has no idea how he will handle this financial conundrum. 
""Let s just take it day-by-day,"" Ma said. 
Some people are going to great lengths to get pay to workers they usually compensate in cash when they show up, using electronic payment services or even driving cash to the provider s house. 
Garrett Smallwood, chief executive of Wag!, an on-demand dog service app, has been using Apple  Pay more than ever before. Smallwood is also leaving cash in his mailbox in envelopes for people he needs to pay. 
""It s a time to be sensitive and thoughtful. To anyone involved in my life or my kids  life, we say:  Please take care of yourself. We re going to continue paying you, "" Smallwood said. 
Wag s usage is down about 50% across the country, with dog boarding the hardest hit because of the lack of travel, Smallwood said. Some work-from-home clients are still having their dogs walked because they cannot leave during the day, and others are leaving tips for regular walkers even though they are not booking. 
But not everyone is stepping up. Jack Thompson, co-owner of LA House Cleaning, which coordinates the services of about 10 independent contractors, only has enough business right now to keep about three cleaners going. Not a single customer who canceled has offered to keep paying. 
""It s pretty bad,"" Thompson said. ""If this goes on for a few months, I m not sure we ll still be in business.""
DECREASED HOURS
Child care services are also seeing a decrease in booking hours. At Care.com s division that handles payroll services for clients, 20% of employers reduced hours to zero, said Eva MacCleery, director of client services at Care.com.
Because those workers have been paid as domestic employees with proper taxes taken out, they should be eligible for unemployment benefits. Those who are still employed would be eligible for whatever sick pay and family leave benefits get approved.
Care.com also is working on help for workers who are paid in cash. 
""We know families would like to continue to pay, but some don’t know what will happen with their own jobs,"" MacCleery said.

By `10:25 AM ET (1425 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 870 points, or 4.1% at 22,071. The S&P 500 was up 3.9% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 3.2%.
The indices had posted their first back-to-back gains in six weeks on Wednesday in anticipation of the $2 trillion stimulus package drafted by the Senate coming into law by Friday. The bill, which earmarks some $540 billion for payments to households and $1 trillion in loans to businesses, state and local governments, passed 96-0 in the upper house, lifting hopes that there will be no further delay.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday that 3.283 million Americans filed for unemployment benefit last week, twice the expected 1.65 million, as companies across the country laid off workers due to the Covid-19 epidemic.
That’s over 1% of the entire U.S. population, over 2% of a workforce measured last month at 164.6 million. For comparison, 5.8 million people were registered as unemployed in February.
“Sadly, this isn t peak as many more layoffs occurred in recent days,” Greg Daco, U.S. economist with Oxford Economics, said via Twitter. He said unemployment was likely to surge well above 10% in April. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had said at the start of the week that the jobless rate could hit 30% in the second quarter as the virus peaks.
Among individual stocks, Boeing  stock was up 12.8% amid reports that up to $17 billion of government loan guarantees and other aid would be made available to it under the terms of the stimulus package.
CEO David Calhoun said earlier this week that Boeing doesn’t need the government to take an equity stake in the company, something that would dilute existing shareholders.
Apple  stock was up 1.9% despite a report by the Japanese newspaper Nikkei alleging that it was preparing to postpone the launch of its new 5G iPhones in the fall.
Among airline stocks, American , Delta  and United  were all up by between 4.6% and 11% as the prospect of government assistance drew nearer."

SEOUL (Reuters) - For  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were going to be its springboard to attain a long-held goal - making significant inroads into Japan s lucrative smartphone market where Apple Inc  dominates.
But after the Games were postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the long-time sponsor s marketing plans - centered on its new S20 smartphone now out too early - have gone awry.
The delay may also mean the South Korean tech giant has lost a crucial window of opportunity. It had been expected to tout its 5G capability in its Olympics ads, aiming to attract a population excited to watch the Games with cutting-edge technology before Apple had a 5G product on the market.
""Samsung was keen to use the Olympics opportunity to get it right in Japan. In that sense, it s a bad situation,"" a person familiar with Samsung s operations told Reuters, noting that Samsung and other sponsors would have to adjust plans.
""A lot of the momentum for smartphone demand in the lead-up to the Olympics will also be gone,"" said the person, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
Former Samsung officials and analysts said Samsung will likely go back to the drawing board to promote a new flagship phone due out next year.
When asked about the impact of the Olympics postponement on its strategy for the Japan market, Samsung declined to comment, saying only it would continue to provide innovative technology for Japanese customers regardless of when the Games commence.
Samsung may be the world s No. 1 smartphone maker by volume but it has just a fraction of the Japanese market.
In contrast, Apple which first began selling the iPhone in Japan in 2008, gained share thanks to an aggressive advertising and pricing campaign from SoftBank (T:9984) - at the time its sole distributor. Japan has since become a loyal premium market and key profit center for the U.S. firm.
Apple currently commands 53% of the Japanese market, Sharp Corp (T:6753) has 12% and Sony Corp (T:6758) has 7%, according to Counterpoint Research. Samsung, which has lost ground since 2013, has 4%.
HARAJUKU HOPES 
Indicative of Samsung s struggles was its 2015 decision to drop its name from smartphones sold in Japan and just go with Galaxy branding - the only market where it does so. It s a move some analysts attribute to historical tensions that often flare up between South Korea and its neighbor. 
""I believe they did so due to the growing number of Japanese consumers who take political factors into account in their purchase considerations,"" said Shengtao Jin, a research analyst at Canalys. 
In its run at Apple s stronghold, Samsung had laid the groundwork for a concerted campaign.
In March last year, it opened the world s biggest Galaxy store in Harajuku, Tokyo s popular shopping district for youth fashion and pop culture. Boasting eight floors, the glitzy building has an exterior decorated with more than 1,000 smartphones. Samsung s mobile and network division chief Koh Dong-jin, officials from the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organizers attended the opening ceremony to mark 500 days until the Games.
Then in May, Samsung s heir and de facto head, Jay. Y Lee traveled to Japan, meeting with executives from mobile carriers NTT DoCoMo Inc (T:9437) and KDDI Corp (T:9433) to discuss 5G cooperation.
DoCoMo and SoftBank Corp (T:9434), the domestic telecom arm of SoftBank Group, are currently rolling out 5G services. But the delay of the Games means 5G is not expected to gain momentum until Apple launches a 5G-capable iPhone, analysts said.
That phone is expected to arrive by end-2020, though some media reports have said it may be delayed by the pandemic.
""Samsung could have taken an early lead in 5G but the Games postponement is a setback,"" said Jeong Ok-hyun, a former LG mobile executive and a professor at Sogang University in Seoul.
""The virus could also lead to delays in the development of the 5G market, which will be a relief to Apple.""
For the time being, it remains to be seen if Samsung will proceed with plans to sell a special Olympics edition S20 phone with 5G capability. The phone to be sold by DoCoMo was due to be launched in June and Samsung began taking pre-orders this month.

Asked if the plan is on track, Samsung said details will be determined after discussions with the IOC and DoCoMo. "

That’s especially true for products used in the U.S. response to the pandemic that are in high demand but running short on supply, such as ventilators, surgical masks and hand sanitizers.
Gojo Industries, the inventor and manufacturer of Purell-branded products, builds its hand-sanitizer and soap dispensers in the U.S., but a key input that ensures the dispensers work is made in China and subject to a 25% duty.
In a tariff-exemption request last year, Akron, Ohio-based Gojo said it’s exploring third-country sourcing but added that unilaterally moving production would require reverse engineering of a key chip that’s manufactured by a Canadian company in China. “Such action would violate their intellectual property” and Gojo “does not control the ability to move that production,” the submission reads.
The U.S. Trade Representative denied Gojo’s request earlier this month, saying the company failed to show that the duties “would cause severe economic harm to you or other U.S. interests,” according to USTR General Counsel Joseph Barloon’s letter on March 5.
Three weeks later, the USTR issued exemptions for Apple s  watches and a range of other products that have no apparent link to Covid-19.
The USTR didn’t respond when asked if the Gojo denial would be reassessed as part of a new exclusion process to identify more products needed to treat the virus or limit its outbreak.
Publicly, American officials have doubled down on their tariff strategy and are calling for a rethink of supply chains, especially when it comes to key medical products."

The app, which will be available in the app store as “COVID-19,” will ask users questions about symptoms, location and risk factors and then provide the appropriate up-to-date guidance from the CDC, White House officials said. 
The app will also answer frequently asked questions about the coronavirus disease with official information from the CDC. The same information will be available at a website https://www.apple.com/covid19 that will be accessible to the users of Windows PCs, Android phones and other non-Apple devices.
Apple said that it will not collect the answers users give to the app and website s questions and that the answers will not be sent to either Apple or any government entity.

Based in northern California, Apple s headquarters have been under lockdown orders for more than a week.

(Reuters) - As China reopens its economy after months of lockdown, Apple Inc s  iPhone factories are largely up and running. But with the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the world, the urgent question for the company is how many buyers there will be both for current models and the new slate of phones expected in the fall.
A senior official at one of Apple s major contract assemblers said Apple s orders for the quarter ending in March are likely to drop 18% compared with the previous year. The production ramp-up for new phones that work with next-generation 5G networks has been postponed, this person said, though it is still possible the 5G phones could launch as scheduled in the fall.
""No one is talking about manpower or material shortage (in China) anymore. Now everyone is looking at whether demand from U.S. and Europe could keep up,"" said the person, who has direct knowledge of the matter. ""The focus now is the demand from consumers in the U.S. and Europe.""
One of Apple s key display suppliers is preparing for a similar level of contraction, according to a person familiar the matter. The company had anticipated shipping 70 million iPhone displays this year, but is now considering lowering that target by more than 17% to 58 million units.
The company is also planning to reduce the workforce at its Apple-designated production lines in its Vietnam factory, where displays are assembled before heading to China to be put into phones, this person said.
Apple declined to comment for this story.
Earlier this month, the company closed retail stores around the world even as it began to reopen outlets in China. With much of Europe and the United States on lockdown and unemployment soaring globally, there is little clarity on when demand might return.
The company could also yet face further supply chain problems as countries including Malaysia and Vietnam impose new restrictions to combat the coronavirus.
""Things are changing on a day by day basis due to supply chain disruptions, so it is difficult to craft any meaningful comment at the moment about both supply and demand,"" said an official at one supplier in Malaysia. 
FOGGY DEMAND OUTLOOK 
In February, Apple retracted its sales forecast for the quarter ended in March without giving a new one. Shares have dropped more than 15% since the start of the year.
""Our base case scenario assumes a shock to June quarter demand with steadily improving results"" in the second half of the year rather than a ""V-shaped"" recovery, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley wrote in a note to investors on March 18.
Taipei-based technology analyst Arthur Liao of Fubon Research cut iPhone shipment forecasts for this year s first quarter to 35 million units, down 17% from 41 million units a year ago. The firm lowered total iPhone shipment forecasts for 2020 to 198 million, down from an earlier forecast of 204 million. 
In the United States, at least, consumers themselves seem uncertain whether they will resume spending. In a survey of more than 2,600 U.S. adults by Civis Analytics conducted March 18-20, more than half of respondents said they planned to spend about the same on consumer electronics as before the virus outbreak if the situation is contained in the coming weeks. 
But if the situation worsens, the respondents were evenly split, with roughly one-third each saying they would spend less, the same or more on consumer electronics when conditions returned to normal.
Such ambiguity has made it hard for Apple suppliers to gauge how 2020 will play out. 
One maker of a sensor for the iPhone said the company continues to produce and ship parts for Apple devices and that this year s first quarter ending in March was better than last year, with the second quarter also likely be higher volume than the year before.
""We were given a forecast for this quarter before the pandemic, about a month ago,"" a person familiar with the situation at the sensor supplier said last week. ""And now we are still producing as per the forecast given to us.""

Investing.com - The ongoing measures from government worldwide to contain the Covid-19 pandemic has led Apple to shutter most of its stores, raising fears of a slump in iPhone sales, but the room for growth in its services and wearables continues to fill some on Wall Street with optimism.
Apple  rose 2%.
Apple s services and wearables units have room to grow, UBS said, after its survey of iPhone users across four geographies showed that 31% of iPhone owners are spending less than $1 each month on the App Store, underscoring the potential for spending to rise in the years ahead.
The number of respondents interested in Apple Arcade, Apple s monthly gaming subscription offering, jumped to 39% from 31%. While the percentage of iPhone owners who own Airpods or an Apple Watch remained low at 12% and 17%, respectively, UBS said.
With coronavirus disruptions to the global economy likely to continue to hurt demand and prompt Apple to delay its 5G iPhone launch, set for the Fall this year, UBS cut its expectations for iPhone sales by 16% to 162 million units.
But iPhone demand will return strongly in 2021, with UBS estimating a 30% increase in unit sales to about 210M million units.
Others on Wall Street are also betting on Apple delaying its 5G phone rollout until the holiday season."

Samsung Display, a unit of South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, said in October that it suspended one of its two LCD production lines at home amid falling demand for LCD panels and a supply glut.
""We will supply ordered LCDs to our customers by the end of this year without any issues,"" the company said in a statement. 
In October, the Apple Inc  supplier said it will invest 13.1 trillion won ($10.72 billion) in facilities and research to upgrade a production line, as it contends with oversupply amid weak global demand for smartphones and TVs.
The investment for the next five years will be focused on converting one of its South Korean LCD lines into a facility to mass produce more advanced ""quantum dot"" screens.
The company runs two LCD production lines at factories in South Korea and two LCD-only factories in China.
Samsung has not yet decided on the future operation of its factories in China, said the spokeswoman.

(Reuters) - Group video chat app Houseparty offered a reward of $1 million for evidence of what it said was a smear campaign against the company as it fought to quash claims that the app was stealing data from others installed on the same smartphone.
Hundreds of tweets have surfaced in the last two days, claiming that Spotify , Snapchat and other accounts on people s phones were hacked after they downloaded the Houseparty app, which was acquired by Fortnite-maker Epic Games last June.
""Our investigation found that many of the original tweets spreading this claim have been deleted and we ve noticed Twitter accounts suspended,"" said Nick Chester, spokesperson for Epic Games, after the company noticed the tweets on Monday morning.
Houseparty, which saw an average daily download of about 278,606 in March as per Reuters  calculations based on data from analytics firm Apptopia, has denied hacking claims.
""All Houseparty accounts are safe - the service is secure, has never been compromised, and doesn t collect passwords for other sites,"" Houseparty said in a tweet.
""We are investigating indications that the recent hacking rumors were spread by a paid commercial smear campaign to harm Houseparty. We are offering a $1,000,000 bounty for the first individual to provide proof of such a campaign to bounty@houseparty.com.""
The app was currently featured on the list of the most downloaded apps on Google  s Play store and Apple  s App store.
Due to lockdowns enforced in several countries to contain the spread of coronavirus, people working from home are using more video and chat apps such as Houseparty, Zoom and Microsoft  s Teams.
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley said no legitimate computer security firm had confirmed that there was a problem with Houseparty.

(Reuters) - Wall Street s slide deepened on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 was set for its worst first quarter since 1938 on growing evidence of a largescale corporate damage from the coronavirus pandemic as well as a near collapse in oil prices.
The benchmark index was tracking its biggest quarterly decline since the 2008 financial crisis, losing more than $5 trillion in market value, as the health crisis worsened in the United States and brought business activity to a standstill.
Real estate stocks , utilities (SPLRCU) and consumer staples (SPLRCS) were among the biggest decliners following a recent rally sparked by bargain hunters looking for stocks likely to weather an economic slump.
""The market is in the process of bottoming out, but this will probably be just a lot of back and forth as the market tries to consolidate around one price level,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
An unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus had helped equity markets stabilize following wild swings in the past month that saw the benchmark S&P 500 rise 9% and slump 12% in two consecutive sessions.
With economists slashing 2020 growth expectations, investors fear corporate defaults and more mass layoffs would lead to a deep and lasting global recession.
""Because the outbreak triggered the economic downturn and the swoon in stock prices, a sustained improvement in the outlook is dependent on the containment of the health crisis,"" said Mark Hamrick, economic analyst at Bankrate.com in Washington, DC. 
At 1:34 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 228.82 points, or 1.02%, at 22,098.66, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 28.67 points, or 1.09%, at 2,597.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 39.13 points, or 0.50%, at 7,735.03.
In one of the fastest turns into a bear market, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes are now set to end the quarter more than 18% below their levels at the start of the year.
The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set for its worst three months since 2018.
Technology stocks (SPLRCT), which have posted the smallest declines among the major S&P 500 sectors this quarter, bounced between gains and losses, partly as traders rebalanced their portfolios at the end of the quarter.
The energy index (SPNY) rose nearly 2%, boosted by a rebound in prices from 18-year lows after the United States and Russia agreed to discuss stabilizing energy markets. [O/R]
The sector has lost about half its value this year from the double whammy of the coronavirus and the Russia-Saudi Arabia price war, forcing refiners to cut production and join a slate of U.S. firms looking to raise cash as liquidity evaporated.
Declining issues nearly matched advancers on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 29 new lows."

Cook said in a post on Twitter last week that Apple donated 10 million masks for health professionals in the United States and Europe, which it sourced through its supply networks.
Supplies and donations have come in from wealthy executives and corporates around the world to fight the coronavirus, which has killed more than 42,000 people globally.
Chinese billionaire and  Alibaba   co-founder Jack Ma has pledged similar medical supply donations including masks and testing kits, as have other Chinese tech giants such as Baidu , Tencent (HK:0700), Huawei and ByteDance, according to Chinese media reports. 
Apple has already donated 20 million yuan of its promised amount through Beijing-based China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to support six hospitals in Hubei, including the makeshift Leishenshan hospital in Wuhan, Cook said.
Apple will contribute the rest of the money to support longer-term public health recovery efforts, he said.
""China has shown incredible spirit and resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak and we are grateful to our teams, partners and customers for their support during these challenging times,"" Cook said in a message on China s Twitter equivalent Weibo.
COVID-19 is the name of the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
Apple warned last month it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales guidance as the ramp-up of Chinese factories that produce iPhones was slower than expected after weeks of closures.

The flu-like virus originated in China last year and has since spread across 205 countries and territories. Globally it has infected more 850,000 people, according to a Reuters tally."

OAKLAND, California (Reuters) - As the coronavirus outbreak forced classes online, Boston Public Schools ordered 20,000 laptops and had them in hand in four days - an unusually fast turnaround made possible by a build-up of inventory prompted by the U.S.-China trade war.
Computer companies including Boston school vendor  Acer  Inc (TW:2353) ordered extra laptops for import in early December ahead of scheduled U.S. tariffs on products from China, where 90% of the world s laptops and monitors are made. 
While the tariff plans have since been canceled as part of a ""phase one"" trade deal, the build is letting companies meet a surge in demand from U.S. students and workers stuck at home due to lockdowns, even as customers in Japan, India and Britain face weeks-long delays and ""out of stock"" signs.
""We re going to be able to fulfill everything for everybody"" in the United States, said Richard Black, a vice president of marketing at Acer, which sold about as many laptops worldwide as Apple Inc  last year. 
""It turned out to be an excellent call to order early."" 
Other products sought after by families on lockdown, including toys and computer monitors, are also relatively plentiful in the United States. They too had been scheduled to fall under a 15% tariff starting last Dec. 15. 
California-based MGA Entertainment, which sells Little Tikes backyard toys and LOL Surprise collectible dolls, in December placed an import order for 15% more than normal from China, or slightly under $10 million in goods, CEO Isaac Larian said.
It has been able to fulfill about 60% of U.S. demand as consumers seek ways to entertain their children at home.
Fulfillment rates are lower in Europe, where MGA did not bring in extra products, Larian said.
""It did work out a little but the supply chain is still disrupted majorly,"" he said.
The virus closed many factories in China for a month or more, delaying spring-time deliveries to warehouses globally.
The coronavirus originated in China last year and has since spread across 205 countries and territories. Globally it has infected more than 850,000 people and killed over 42,000, according to a Reuters tally.

DEMAND IS BUZZING
Some popular computer monitors now are out of stock even in the United States as a result of the work-from-home rush, said Linn Huang, an analyst at technology market tracker IDC.
On Amazon.com , merchants have raised prices on top-rated consumer laptops by $50 to $100, according to tracking on price comparison tool CamelCamelCamel. 
However, businesses purchasing from commercial sellers have not seen price jumps, according to industry analysts.
Boston schools paid $5 million, or about the usual $250 each, for the 20,000 Chromebooks sent by Acer on two trucks each from warehouses in Los Angeles and Chicago.
""Now is not the time when dealing with children and education environments to try to jack up prices and have some short-term profitability,"" Acer s Black said. 
Analysts expect laptop demand to slow if the global economy sputters further and widespread layoffs continue due to the impact of the virus. 
But with many still tuning their work-from-home set-ups, demand is buzzing. Computer exports from South Korea surged 82% in March over last year.
Some computer makers are even weighing the expensive move of transporting devices by plane versus boat, said Jeff Lin, a Tapei-based researcher at Omdia.

The goal, he said, is to gain market share by being first to get devices in stock."

The smart-tracker maker was one of four companies that testified against the big tech platforms - Tile focused on Apple - in a January hearing in Colorado of a panel of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
At the time, Tile s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that the company had initially had a mutually beneficial relationship with Apple which deteriorated last year amid signs that Apple planned to bring out a similar product.
""Unfortunately, since that hearing, Apple’s anti-competitive behaviors have gotten worse, not better,"" Tile said in a statement to the committee posted online on Wednesday.
Tile had objected to Apple requiring its users to repeatedly agree to allow Tile to operate in the background, which is crucial to Tile s service. Without background location access, Tile s app can only detect when a user loses keys or a wallet if they happen to lose it while the app is open.
""Despite Apple’s multiple promises to reinstate  Always Allow  background permissions option for third party apps  geolocation services, Apple has not yet done so,"" Tile said.
Tile also said that there were indications that Apple planned to update its Find My product, adding hardware, so it would be a competitor to Tile.
Apple declined comment but pointed to a response it made to the committee in February which said that iOS 13 was aimed at strengthening privacy practices by reminding users that a third-party app is potentially using their location data.
Apple s Find My app enables background location tracking, Tile said, without these reminders.
Reuters reported in February that the U.S. Justice Department has reached out to app developers as part of its investigation into Apple.
The committee is one of several investigations underway into the big tech platforms, which also include Alphabet  s Google, Facebook  and Amazon . The investigations are being carried out by the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and two groups of attorneys general from dozens of states."

To make purchases inside apps on its App Store, Apple requires the use of Apple s own payment systems and takes a commission of between 15% and 30% before passing on the rest to the third-party app developer. 
Many of Apple s rivals in streaming music and video, such as Netflix Inc  and Spotify  Technology SA, avoid paying those commissions by asking users to sign up with a credit card outside the App Store. That leaves those rivals  apps serving as log-in screens for existing customers.
Spotify said Apple s practices hurt its business by making it harder for iPhone users to sign up for Spotify instead of Apple Music and filed an antitrust complaint last year in the European Union. Spotify has also raised the issue with the U.S. Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee, both of which have antitrust probes pending regarding Apple.
But Apple lifted the practice on Wednesday for some purchases. In an emailed statement, Apple said that for ""qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Altice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.” Apple also said the services will function better with Apple devices and apps, for example by letting users ask its voice assistant, Siri, to find shows on the third-party services.

Apple did not say when it began the program, how video apps could qualify, or whether Netflix and Spotify are or will be included. Apple launched its own streaming television service called Apple TV+ last year."

545,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/coronavirus-punishes-warren-buffetts-equity-holdings-2129571,2020-04-02,Coronavirus punishes Warren Buffett's equity holdings By Reuters,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic may have erased around $64 billion of value from Warren Buffett s equity portfolio at  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), setting up the conglomerate for one of the largest quarterly losses ever by an American company.
""The headline number will be ugly,"" said James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst with a ""buy"" rating on Berkshire, referring to net results. 
Berkshire s portfolio of U.S.-listed stocks, including Kraft Heinz Co , may have shrunk by 26% in the first quarter if Berkshire did no buying and selling, according to Refinitiv data and regulatory filings. 
By contrast, the Standard & Poor s 500 (SPX) fell just 20%, and Berkshire s own stock fell about the same.
Buffett urges investors to think long-term, focusing on Berkshire s operating results and the intrinsic value of its stock holdings, some of which it has owned for decades.
In his Feb. 22 shareholder letter, Buffett said he expects the stocks to deliver ""major gains,"" albeit irregularly.
Still, the declines reflect challenges the pandemic poses even for Buffett, the world s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine and among its most esteemed investors.
They also followed Buffett s prediction in a Feb. 24 interview on CNBC, five days after the S&P 500 set an all-time high, that Berkshire would outperform in down markets, and over the long term perform ""in a very, very safe manner.""
The 89-year-old Buffett had prostate cancer in 2012, and last month began working at his Omaha, Nebraska, home rather than Berkshire s office two miles away. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his assistant.
Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, its namesake energy company and smaller businesses such as See s candies and Borsheims jewelry. AIRLINES STAGGER Since 2018, an accounting rule has required Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stocks with earnings, resulting in huge gyrations.
For example, annual net income swelled to $81.42 billion in 2019 from $4.02 billion in 2018, a down year for stocks, while operating profit fell 3% to $23.97 billion.
After taxes are factored in, Berkshire s first-quarter net loss could rival quarterly losses of $44.9 billion posted by AOL Time Warner in 2002, or $42.5 billion by General Motors  in 2007. Berkshire s loss could grow further if it wrote down its 26.6% Kraft Heinz stake, which some analysts call overdue. But it would likely fall short of American International Group Inc s  $61.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008. Much of the weakness likely came in financials, where the value of Berkshire s disclosed stakes in Bank of America Corp ,  Wells Fargo  & Co  and  American Express  Co  fell about $27 billion in the quarter. Berkshire s stake in Apple Inc , its largest holding, may have fallen nearly $9 billion. Another $5 billion may have disappeared from stakes in the four biggest U.S. carriers:  American Airlines Group  Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co  and United Airlines Holdings Inc . And Occidental Petroleum Co  sank 72%, stung by plunging oil prices and leverage after it bought Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which Berkshire helped fund with $10 billion of preferred stock throwing off $800 million of annual dividends. FOOD NOURISHES
Quarterly results are expected around May 2 when Berkshire holds its annual meeting, though the pandemic forced Buffett to cancel the surrounding ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" a weekend of events that normally draw more than 40,000 people to Omaha.
At least four Berkshire-owned stocks rose last quarter. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all are associated with consumer staples or healthcare, sectors that many investors expect to outperform in down markets.
They included retailer Amazon.com Inc , biotechnology company Biogen Inc , kidney dialysis provider  DaVita Inc   and grocer  Kroger Co  .
Another grocer in Berkshire s portfolio, Costco Wholesale Corp , fell just 3%. It remains unclear how the pandemic might let Buffett whittle Berkshire s $128 billion cash pile. Buffett prefers buying whole companies to stocks, but has not made an ""elephant"" sized acquisition since 2016. He could also offer lifelines to companies, as he did during the 2008-2009 financial crisis for  General Electric  Co ,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  and even Harley-Davidson Inc . Shanahan said Buffett could find many new places to invest.
""I would be super-disappointed if he didn t put tens of billions of dollars of his capital to work in the first half of this year,"" he said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Infectious disease researchers are using  Facebook Inc   mobile location data to provide daily updates to U.S. cities and states evaluating the effectiveness of social distancing orders aimed at slowing the novel coronavirus.
The COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a group of 40 health researchers from universities including Harvard, Princeton and Johns Hopkins, said that since mid-March its members have been sharing insights gleaned from the social media giant s data with California, Massachusetts and New York City.
Using mobile location data in the coronavirus fight comes amid intense scrutiny of the privacy practices of tech companies, which collect detailed information about people s interests on apps and websites, often to target ads.
Facebook and the researchers leading the project say they have overcome those concerns by aggregating the data several times over and funneling it through academics. The researchers share broad findings with state and local health departments, which do not receive any raw data.
Facebook confirmed it was sharing the data as part of its nearly year-old Disease Prevention Maps program, which has also aided efforts to increase vaccination rates in Malawi and track cholera outbreaks in Mozambique.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters last month that he would not consider sharing Facebook s data directly with governments. 
The Mobility Data Network has become one of the first initiatives to harness mobile data for the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, an approach deployed early in places like China, South Korea and much of Europe but scarcely used so far in the United States.
With the virus already spread widely throughout the country, the research focuses on the success of measures designed to get people to stay home, as almost 40 U.S. states have ordered.
Using the data, which is stripped of identifying information, researchers provide insights like the average distance of trips users have taken in a city and the proportion of residents in each county that have stayed within their 600 square meter home ""tiles.""
In New York, for example, researchers found mobility dropped significantly on the weekends but crept back up on weekdays, when many people - particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods - are still required to work.
The data can also show ""if at first people stop moving but then begin to travel further once fatigue sets in,"" said Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard s School of Public Health who is among those leading the network.
Measuring changes in mobility and correlating them with later hospitalizations can also eventually help determine how to roll back social distancing orders, said Buckee, who previously studied the spread of malaria and dengue using mobile data.
GRABBING LOCATION DATA
About half of the apps on Alphabet  Inc s Google s Play Store and a quarter on Apple Inc  s App Store use at least one service capable of grabbing location data, according to industry research firm Appfigures.
Smaller location tracking services including Cuebiq and Camber Systems are queued up to provide inputs to the research network, too.
Others in talks to receive location analyses include Maryland, Washington and the District of Columbia, along with Los Angeles, San Jose, Santa Clara and Kansas City.
Kansas City confirmed that it was considering taking part in the project, while the other government agencies did not respond to requests for comment.
Facebook is in touch with the White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a spokeswoman said, but added that no analyses have been delivered to any U.S. federal entities so far.
Another coronavirus data initiative, the Data and Research Technology Task Force, is liaising with Vice President Mike Pence s coronavirus task force and includes employees from Alphabet Inc s Google,  Microsoft Corp   and Amazon.com Inc , said Josh Mendelsohn, who worked on disaster aid programs at Google a decade ago.
The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Although other countries have successfully used location data to warn contacts of those with infections, neither officials nor researchers in the United States have asked for such personal information, said Mendelsohn.

""Contact tracing is something that we were beyond weeks ago,"" said Mendelsohn. ""They need something that shows how we are doing vis-a-vis social distancing, which statistically models what we are about to be in for, so as to predict patient load."""

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - China s recovery from the coronavirus outbreak may hold investable lessons for the rest of the globe, according to fund managers who are closely watching - and have begun cautiously buying - in the world s second-biggest economy.
With the worst of the outbreak yet to come in many countries, including the United States, new infections appear to be trailing off in China and businesses are gradually getting back to work.
Money managers are studying everything from subway patronage to noodle consumption - to understand the society and economy that is emerging from lockdown, as both a portent of what may be to come in the West and as a proving ground for new trades.
""What happens in China is incredibly important to how global markets react over the next few months, both in terms of the progress of the virus and how quickly the economy is bouncing back,"" said Sydney-based fund manager Geoff Wilson, who runs A$3 billion ($2 billion) in assets.
After observing that even as lockdowns lift in China, people are staying in and going online for entertainment, his fund has raised its stake in Chinese internet juggernaut Tencent, and increased exposure to similar stocks elsewhere.
Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) shares have rallied nearly 17% from a three-month low touched two weeks ago.
Some see opportunities in construction or commodities, while others are staying on the sidelines. 
""Everything is up in the air,"" said Chi Lo, Greater China economist at  BNP Paribas   Asset Management in Hong Kong. 
""From the usual industrial output to high-frequency data, to even travel by train or air traffic, we have to look at it now just to make sure we are kept abreast of what s happening.""
(Graphic: Recovery hopes? Equity fund flows to China png link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/dgkpldmepbx/eikon.png)
FROM CHINA WITH HOPE
The virus itself is the main focus, with palpable fear of a second wave of infections, as occurred in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, stymieing the recovery at home and abroad. 
China now accounts for less than a tenth of worldwide coronavirus infections, 7% of deaths and barely any of the new daily cases. Yet the re-introduction of some restrictions on movement this week underscores the fragility of that position. Companies and consumers remain on edge.
There are also worries about the impact of a global demand shock on China s exporters, even if factory activity unexpectedly expanded last month, albeit marginally, after a collapse in February.
Which is why most investors are seeking out longer term bets and seem to be relying more on their own contacts and intuition to assess the strength of the recovery.
""We ve spoken to Tencent, we ve spoken to (fast food firm) Yum China, we ve spoken to a Taiwanese consumer company that sells noodles in China,"" said Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Janus Henderson. ""We understand what s happening on the ground...people are returning to work.""
He has increased exposure to China in the $3 billion in funds he manages, and, while he cautioned against drawing too many parallels, said the trend of rising internet use that had buoyed holdings in Tencent and  Alibaba  would probably travel.
Tencent is an online conglomerate comprising online gaming, e-commerce and social media arms, while Alibaba is primarily an online retailer. U.S. firms such as Facebook , Apple  and Google  are likely beneficiaries of the same trends, Gillan said.
Catriona Burns, global portfolio manager at Geoff Wilson s Sydney fund, raised bets on Tencent, online retailer Amazon.com Inc  and gaming firm Activision Blizzard Inc  for similar reasons.
""The feedback from China...is that people are going back to work, but they re not necessarily going out on the town. So they re staying home and they need entertainment - gaming should be a key beneficiary of that trend,"" she said.
""That confirmed a thesis we were thinking about anyway, that we might see some permanent changes in behaviour.""

EARLY DAYS
Price movements have put such bets in the black, but cash flow data paints a more complex and cautious picture.
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  (HK:9988) is up about 10% from lows a few weeks ago, while Amazon and Activision have seen similar rallies.
Some $7 billion in funds flowed in to Chinese equities through the second half of March, according to EPFR Global, the biggest two-week surge in five years.
Yet that came with exchange data showing record outflows for the month as a whole, and with analysts ringing alarm bells that China s economy likely shrank in the first quarter for the first time in 30 years.
Bank of America  on Thursday cut its full-year growth forecast for China from 1.5% to 1.2% - compared with 6.1% for 2019 - forecasting a deeper and longer slump in global demand.
""You can say China is operating back to normal but it doesn t operate in self-isolation,"" said Kunjal Gala co-portfolio manager, Federated Hermes, who has added a little to positions in China and South Korea, but cautiously.
""Both of these countries are not safe, as both have bet on exports, and with the U.S. and Europe slowing down because of this lockdown, demand is going to be fairly subdued.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday threw out a lawsuit seeking to hold Major League Baseball, the Houston Astros and the Boston Red Sox liable to DraftKings fantasy baseball bettors for the sport s sign-stealing scandal.
Although both teams ""shamelessly"" used electronic devices to steal signs, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said statements by the teams and baseball commissioner Rob Manfred about the sport s integrity did not make them liable to DraftKings participants who wagered on tainted games.
Rakoff also found no legal obligation for the defendants to disclose the practice, and that supposed denials by now-fired Astros manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow that the team stole signs did not justify letting the lawsuit proceed.
The Astros and Red Sox ""broke the hearts of all true baseball fans,"" Rakoff wrote. ""But did the initial efforts of those teams, and supposedly Major League Baseball itself, to conceal these foul deeds from the simple sports bettors who wagered on fantasy baseball create a cognizable legal claim? On the allegations here made, the answer is no.""
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Major League Baseball, the Astros and their lawyers had no immediate comment or could not immediately be reached. A Red Sox spokeswoman declined to comment.
In January, Major League Baseball found that the Astros improperly used technology to decode signs between opposing pitchers and catchers and relayed the information to batters so they would know what pitches were coming.
Manfred fined the Red Sox in September 2017 for using an Apple  Watch to capture signs from the New York Yankees.
The lawsuit covered alleged sign-stealing from 2017, when the Astros won the World Series, through 2019.

The Astros have also faced lawsuits by season ticket holders who said sign-stealing enabled the team to raise ticket prices, and by former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Mike Bolsinger, who said a bad August 2017 outing against the team derailed his career. "

Winfrey, one of America s richest and most influential women, made the announcement on her social media platforms.
""I am donating $10 million overall to help Americans during this pandemic in cities across the country and in areas where I grew up,"" she said. Winfrey, 66, was born into poverty in Mississippi and raised in Milwaukee and Tennessee.
Part of the money will go towards the new initiative called America s Food Fund, launched in conjunction with Apple Inc , the Ford Foundation, Laurene Powell Jobs and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
It will help feed those most impacted by the coronavirus epidemic in America, including children who rely on school lunch programs, low-income families, the elderly, and individuals facing job disruptions.
""I still remember growing up with my mother in Milwaukee when we were all out of welfare and sometimes we needed assistance for our family just to survive. At times like this, so many more people are vulnerable,"" Winfrey said.
She did not say where she would direct the bulk of her $10 million donation.
Winfrey made her announcement the same day as U.S. data showed that a record 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week.
Winfrey last month launched a weekly series on Apple s new streaming service, Apple TV+, called ""Oprah Talks COVID-19,"" in which she speaks over video platforms with spiritual leaders and others about how to get through the crisis.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is struggling to retain its lead in global next-generation 5G telecom services, as the coronavirus pandemic further cools sentiment of consumers whose interest in the technology has waned due to cost and quality concerns.
The Asian nation s telecom operators, led by SK Telecom and KT Corp, launched the world s first 5G services exactly a year ago. And Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), its dominant mobile phone manufacturer, stole a march on equipment makers globally by launching the first 5G phone around the same time.
But after an early growth spurt driven by generous subsidies for 5G smartphones, the hype has almost vanished as customers question the value of pricier handsets and sometimes-spotty 5G services. Now the coronavirus crisis is hitting demand hard.
Sales of Samsung s new 5G-ready Galaxy S20 phones, which were launched at the end of February with prices as high as 1,595,000 won ($1,308.81), are down about 30% in South Korea compared with early sales of its previous model S10 series, an official at a South Korean operator told Reuters. 
The weak reception came even though sales of new phones usually surge right after the product launch, the person said.
The 5G slowdown in South Korea shows how the coronavirus could hobble the takeoff of the technology globally. Smartphone makers, including Apple Inc , which is currently scheduled to launch 5G phones in the fall, had been counting on 5G for a sales boost after two years of industry-wide contraction. 
Plans for futuristic services such as self-driving cars and fully automated factories and cities could also be affected by 5G delays. Spain, Italy, France and Austria have postponed auctions for 5G spectrum because of the coronavirus.
China s 5G sales, by contrast, are expected to recover in the second quarter, boosting Chinese companies including Huawei [HWT.UL], said Tom Kang, an analyst at research firm Counterpoint.
Xiaomi Corp, which recently unveiled a new flagship 5G smartphone, said it is seeing signs of a sales recovery in China as the country starts to return to normal following the coronavirus lockdown. 
Samsung has only a small presence in China and sells most of its premium 5G phones in other markets. 
IMPACT ON BOTTOMLINE
South Korean carriers added about 400,000 new 5G customers in February, government data showed, an increase from 290,000 in the preceding month. But analysts saw that as a subdued number given the launch of Samsung s S20. And it was less than half the 880,000 recorded in August.
The 5G market started slowing in November as telecom operators curtailed marketing spending and customer complaints grew about choppy network connections and a lack of differentiated content.
(Graphic: South Korea s monthly 5G subscriber growth link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/yzdpxnkgpxe/eikon.png)
Analysts said operators and handset makers have to rely on fresh subsidies to revive demand, eroding their bottom lines. 
Samsung had counted on South Korea to take an early lead in the 5G phone market last year. It was expected to expand 5G phone sales in other major markets like the United States and Europe, ahead of Apple s iPhone launch, but the coronavirus is setting back such plans, analysts say.
U.S. retailers are already offering about 20% discount for online sales of the S20, which was launched in America just a month ago. Samsung s unlocked S20 devices are being sold at $799.99 on Best Buy and Amazon.com Inc , about $200 discounts from its original $999.99 price. 
Samsung declined to comment for the story. A Samsung Electronics chief executive told shareholders in mid-March 5G smartphone demand was expected to rise this year.
In an effort to boost volume, Samsung plans to launch more affordable 5G smartphones such as the A71 series in Korea in the first half of this year, a telecom source said. 
""Consumers are cautious about buying new phones, because of little perceived differences between 4G and 5G phones and price hike from 4G phones, especially with the virus dampening consumer sentiment,"" said Kim Hoi-jae, an analyst at Daeshin Securities.
""Therefore, handset makers are expected to launch budget 5G phones faster.""
South Korea reported on Friday 86 new coronavirus infections that raised the national tally to 10,062. While the daily infections have eased from their peaks, consumers are seen wary of buying handsets.
""In times like this, changing your phone is not just a priority,"" said a manager at a phone retail store in Seoul.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Infectious disease researchers are using  Facebook Inc   mobile location data to provide daily updates to U.S. cities and states evaluating the effectiveness of social distancing orders aimed at slowing the novel coronavirus.
The COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a group of 40 health researchers from universities including Harvard, Princeton and Johns Hopkins, said that since mid-March its members have been sharing insights gleaned from the social media giant s data with California, Massachusetts and New York City.
Using mobile location data in the coronavirus fight comes amid intense scrutiny of the privacy practices of tech companies, which collect detailed information about people s interests on apps and websites, often to target ads.
Facebook and the researchers leading the project say they have overcome those concerns by aggregating the data several times over and funneling it through academics. The researchers share broad findings with state and local health departments, which do not receive any raw data.
Facebook confirmed it was sharing the data as part of its nearly year-old Disease Prevention Maps program, which has also aided efforts to increase vaccination rates in Malawi and track cholera outbreaks in Mozambique.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters last month that he would not consider sharing Facebook s data directly with governments. 
The Mobility Data Network has become one of the first initiatives to harness mobile data for the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, an approach deployed early in places like China, South Korea and much of Europe but scarcely used so far in the United States.
With the virus already spread widely throughout the country, the research focuses on the success of measures designed to get people to stay home, as almost 40 U.S. states have ordered.
Using the data, which is stripped of identifying information, researchers provide insights like the average distance of trips users have taken in a city and the proportion of residents in each county that have stayed within their 600 square meter home ""tiles.""
In New York, for example, researchers found mobility dropped significantly on the weekends but crept back up on weekdays, when many people - particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods - are still required to work.
The data can also show ""if at first people stop moving but then begin to travel further once fatigue sets in,"" said Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard s School of Public Health who is among those leading the network.
Measuring changes in mobility and correlating them with later hospitalizations can also eventually help determine how to roll back social distancing orders, said Buckee, who previously studied the spread of malaria and dengue using mobile data.
GRABBING LOCATION DATA
About half of the apps on Alphabet  Inc s Google s Play Store and a quarter on Apple Inc  s App Store use at least one service capable of grabbing location data, according to industry research firm Appfigures.
Smaller location tracking services including Cuebiq and Camber Systems are queued up to provide inputs to the research network, too.
Others in talks to receive location analyses include Maryland, Washington and the District of Columbia, along with Los Angeles, San Jose, Santa Clara and Kansas City.
Kansas City confirmed that it was considering taking part in the project, while the other government agencies did not respond to requests for comment.
Facebook is in touch with the White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a spokeswoman said, but added that no analyses have been delivered to any U.S. federal entities so far.
Another coronavirus data initiative, the Data and Research Technology Task Force, is liaising with Vice President Mike Pence s coronavirus task force and includes employees from Alphabet Inc s Google,  Microsoft Corp   and Amazon.com Inc , said Josh Mendelsohn, who worked on disaster aid programs at Google a decade ago.
The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Although other countries have successfully used location data to warn contacts of those with infections, neither officials nor researchers in the United States have asked for such personal information, said Mendelsohn.

""Contact tracing is something that we were beyond weeks ago,"" said Mendelsohn. ""They need something that shows how we are doing vis-a-vis social distancing, which statistically models what we are about to be in for, so as to predict patient load."""

SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus-driven global shift to working from home is set to have boosted demand for Samsung Electronics (KS:005930)  memory chips from laptop makers and data centres, but first-quarter profits are likely to remain flat as the outbreak weakened consumer electronics sales.
The South Korean tech giant is the world s largest memory chip maker, and its Galaxy smartphones are a major rival of Apple Inc  s products. 
Samsung, which also makes home appliances and displays, on Tuesday releases guidance for the January-March quarter profit which is widely expected to be unchanged, and come under pressure in the next few quarters as the impact of coronavirus-related factory and retail stores shutdowns bites.
""The visibility for Samsung s earnings is low for the second quarter,"" said Lee Do-hoon, an analyst at CIMB Research.
For the quarter which just ended, Samsung is likely to estimate its operating profit at 6.2 trillion won ($5.05 billion), unchanged from the same period a year ago, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, weighted towards more consistently accurate analysts.
However, the company already warned last month that the pandemic would hurt sales of smartphones and consumer electronics goods this year, and analysts said a prolonged virus outbreak could put higher demand for memory chips at risk.
""If COVID-19 continues into 2H20, the memory market outlook could change for the worse,"" CW Chung, head of research at Nomura in Korea, said in a recent report.
When the outbreak first started in China last year, Samsung s strategy of spreading out its production base to countries including Vietnam and India seemed to pay off: rivals such as Apple were hit by supply disruptions as China shut down factories and locked down cities to control the coronavirus.
Apple rescinded its profit forecast earlier this year due to production halts and retail store shutdowns in China.
But as the virus spread across the globe, Samsung too has had to close factories and retail stores in Europe, India and the United States, further unnerving investors: Samsung Electronics shares have slumped 15% so far this year, but outperformed the wider market s 22% fall.
Prospects for Samsung s flagship Galaxy S20 premium smartphones, launched more than one month ago, look dim. Its 5G-enabled S20 phones are already selling at a third of their launch price of $1,308 in South Korea, an official at a local carrier told Reuters.
Brokerage Hanwha Investment & Securities estimates Samsung smartphone sales fell 17% in the first quarter from a year earlier. Last year, a slump in profits at the smartphone and chip businesses more than halved Samsung s full-year earnings.
Its display business, which counts Apple and China s Huawei Technologies as customers, is likely to have swung back to a loss after three consecutive quarterly profit due to sluggish demand from its clients, analysts said.

Samsung only provides its estimates for its first-quarter revenue and operating profit on Tuesday, with details likely to be released later this month."

Taiwan is one of Asia s major exporters, especially of technology goods, and its export trend is a key gauge of global demand for technology gadgets worldwide. 
Forecasts ranged widely from a decline of 20% to growth of 1.8% amid uncertainties over the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted global supply chains and led to closure of factories by tech manufacturers including Apple  s main supplier, Foxconn.
Taiwan s exports unexpectedly leapt 24.9% in February from a year earlier, on strong sales of chips and telecommunication equipment, and off a low base, as the traditional week-long Lunar New Year holiday fell in February last year, meaning there were fewer working days.
But the government has repeatedly warned of uncertainty for the trade outlook due to the pandemic, and said last month that Taiwan s March exports were expected to decline 2% to 5% compared with the year-ago period.
The government is rolling out an economic stimulus package that it expects to eventually be worth T$1.05 trillion ($34.71 billion).
The central bank in Taiwan, whose largest trading partner is China, last month cut its full-year growth outlook to 1.92% from a December forecast of 2.57%, though some banks expect the economy to shrink in 2020.
Inflation in March was seen at 0.13% from a year earlier, the poll found, sharply down from 1.85% in January - the highest in 21 months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Governors of New York, New Jersey and Louisiana pointed to tentative signs on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak may be starting to plateau but warned against complacency as the death toll nationwide topped 10,000 and the number of known infections surpassed 360,000. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said statewide fatalities from COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus, were up 599 from Sunday, on par with an increase of 594 during the previous 24 hours and 630 on Friday.
The state s overall tally of confirmed cases grew by 7% from the previous day to 130,680. But hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units and the number of patients put on ventilator machines to keep them breathing had all declined - signs the crisis may be leveling off, Cuomo said
""While none of this is good news, the possible flattening of the curve is better than the increases that we have seen,"" Cuomo told a daily briefing, referring to the trend line formed when infections, deaths and other data are plotted on a graph. ""If we are plateauing, we are plateauing at a high level.""
The tentative signs of progress sent U.S. stocks up sharply, with all major indexes closing at least 7% higher on the day. Despite Monday s bounce, the broad-based S&P 500 (SPX) remained down more than 21% from its Feb. 19 peak, compared with its March low, when it was off 30 percent from its apex. 
In neighboring New Jersey, the state with the second-highest number of cases and deaths, Governor Phil Murphy told reporters, ""Our efforts to flatten the curve are starting to pay off."" He cited a 12 percent day-to-day growth rate in confirmed positive cases on Monday, half the rate from March 30.
All told, New Jersey has confirmed more than 41,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths from COVID-19. And Murphy warned that a relaxation of social-distancing and hand-washing guidelines would trigger a renewed surge in cases that could yet overwhelm the healthcare system.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards likewise expressed cautious optimism that efforts to contain transmission of the virus were working in his state, also among those hardest hit by the pandemic.
""New hospital admissions are trending downward,"" he told an afternoon news conference. ""But this will only become a trend if we keep mitigation efforts up.""
The rates of increase also appeared to be slowing in the New York-adjacent state of Connecticut, where Governor Ned Lamont said, ""Our healthcare system is bending but not breaking."" 
To keep his state from back-sliding, Cuomo extended until April 29 an order to keep non-essential businesses and schools closed, and doubled the maximum fine for ignoring social distancing rules to $1,000.
At least one key analysis offered hope that the death rate was slowing in the United States. The University of Washington s research model - one of several cited by leading health authorities - now projects 81,766 U.S. coronavirus fatalities by Aug. 4, down about 12,000 from a projection over the weekend.
White House medical experts have forecast that between 100,000 to 240,000 American lives may be lost in the pandemic, even if sweeping orders to stay home are followed.
 PEAK DEATH WEEK 
Despite the upbeat signs, a national U.S. health official said the country was entering what is likely to be its most lethal week of the pandemic.
U.S. fatalities, numbering 10,600 on Monday, were rapidly closing in on Italy and Spain, the countries with the greatest loss of life to date at more than 16,000 and over 13,000, respectively, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
""It s going to be the peak hospitalization, peak ICU week and unfortunately, peak death week,"" Admiral Brett Giroir, a physician and member of the White House coronavirus task force, told ABC s ""Good Morning America"" on Monday.
More than 90% of Americans were under stay-at-home orders issued by state governors in recent weeks, with South Carolina joining on Monday. Eight states have yet to impose such restrictions.
Political leaders and medical professionals have voiced alarm for weeks over crippling scarcities of personal protective gear for first-responders and front-line healthcare workers, as well as shortages of ventilators, drugs and other supplies. 
Citing the dire needs of New York and other states, California Governor Gavin Newsom said his state would loan 500 of its ventilators to the largely depleted Strategic National Stockpile of medical equipment.
Deaths in New York reached 4,758 as of Monday - 45 % of the national total.
California still faces a projected ventilator shortage of its own next month. Newsom said California was in the process of procuring additional machines but had enough to spare for the time being.
 NEED HEROES  
In Michigan, the governor said three major health systems are expected to exhaust their supplies of face shields in less than three days, and surgical gowns in less than six.
Medications administered to patients on ventilators are also running low, said John Fox, president of Beaumont Health, one of Michigan’s largest healthcare systems.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said a shortage of medical professionals was replacing a lack of equipment as the city’s main difficulty, with an additional 45,000 clinical personnel needed to get through April.
New York City alone accounts for two-thirds of all coronavirus-related deaths in the state, the U.S. epicenter of the epidemic.
""More and more, the challenge is going to be personnel,"" de Blasio told reporters outside a surgical gown manufacturing facility. ""We need these supplies, but we also need heroes to wear them.""
The city has reported more than 3,100 deaths, and it may resort to temporarily burying the dead in a park, said Mark Levine, chair of the New York City Council health committee.

""Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line,"" Levine wrote on Twitter. ""It will be done in a dignified, orderly - and temporary - manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take."""

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit likely managed to rise slightly from a slump a year earlier, as solid chip sales helped cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic on smartphones and TVs.
The global leader in semiconductors is benefiting from higher demand for chips from laptop makers and data centres amid the coronavirus-driven shift to working from home, even as its mobile and consumer electronics businesses suffer.
Samsung said operating profit was expected to be 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) in the quarter ended March, compared with 6.2 trillion won a year ago and the 6.2 trillion won estimate from analysts according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate. 
Revenue likely rose 5% to 55 trillion won from a year ago, in line with the 55.6 trillion won estimate. 
Samsung Electronics shares were 2.3% higher while the broader market (KS11) was up 1.9%. 
The maker of smartphones, TVs, appliances, memory chips and displays is the first global tech company to report its January-to-March quarter earnings estimates. 
Samsung Electronics said last month the coronavirus would hurt sales of smartphones - which accounted for about 47% of its revenue last year - and consumer electronics in 2020, while demand from data centres would fuel a recovery in memory chip markets. 
""Even though Samsung’s mobile business was hit by the coronavirus outbreak this quarter, it will likely face bigger challenges in the second quarter - now that the United States and Europe have become the hardest-hit countries,"" Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Securities, said.
When the coronavirus outbreak started in China last year, Samsung’s strategy of spreading its production base to countries including Vietnam and India seemed to pay off as supply disruptions in China hit rivals such as Apple .
But as the virus spread across the globe, Samsung too has had to close factories and retail stores in Europe, India and the United States. 
NH Investment & Securities said on Tuesday it expected sales of Samsung s premium Galaxy 20 smartphone to reach 20 million units this year, far short of the 32 million it had forecast earlier.
LG Electronics (KS:066570), Samsung s crosstown rival in TVs, phones and appliances, meanwhile said its first-quarter operating profit likely rose 21% to 1 trillion won. Analysts expect the coronavirus to affect LG this quarter. 
CHIP BUFFER 
Samsung Electronics did not provide a breakdown of earnings for each division in its guidance released on Tuesday.
Analysts say the company s memory chip business, which generated more than 50% of its operating profit in 2019, would likely report better-than-expected results in the first half of this year. 
Memory chip prices are rising as work-from-home requirements boost demand from the data centres that support internet services such as streaming and cloud computing, analysts have said. 
Prices for DRAM memory chips are up more than 3.5% since January, according to industry tracker DRAMeXchange. 
""If the coronavirus outbreak doesn’t die down in the third quarter, demand for memory chips might face a bump,"" said Song Myeong-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.

BEIJING / HONG KONG (Reuters) - Luckin Coffee s app has rocketed to become the second most popular in China as consumers rushed to claim a free drink that it has long offered for downloading, worried the chain might collapse after it said much of its sales last year were fabricated.
""I heard that if you download the app, you will get free coffee,"" said Beijing-based Gan Lin, 35, who downloaded the app on Friday.
""I m not that into coffee but it would be a pity to lose the chance for a free drink. After all, you don t know how much longer Luckin can hold on.""
The coffee chain s app usually ranks between the 70th and 100th most popular free app downloads for users of Apple  s iOS operating system in China, according to app performance tracker App Annie. Apple s App Store is one of the biggest in China.
Luckin s shock announcement last Thursday that its chief operating officer and other employees had fabricated sales sent its shares plunging more than 80% and wiped more than $5 billion off the company s market capitalisation.
The  Starbucks Corp   rival only went public last year, positioning itself as a tech version of a retail business, where users ordered coffee via its app for delivery to their offices and homes. 
It has relied heavily on discounted sales to drive its fast growth and capture market share. The loss-making company began operations in January 2018 and by December 2019, had over 4,500 stores - overtaking Starbucks, with 4,100, in the process.
Luckin on Sunday said its business would continue to operate as normal and apologised to its customers.
The company did not respond on Tuesday to a request for comment on the surge in demand for its app. 
The newfound Luckin coffee frenzy has been strong enough to freeze the app in many Chinese cities, leaving customers unable to place orders for several hours.
On Luckin’s Weibo social media account, thousands of users have expressed hope the coffee chain will continue to operate because they haven’t used up their vouchers. 
Some were more genuine fans. One said on Weibo that if Luckin survived the scandal, he would drink Luckin ""even if there is no discount"". His comment gained 66,000 likes on Weibo.

SHANGHAI/SEOUL (Reuters) - Smartphone sales in China are rising again as COVID-19 cases there decline and global demand for chips used in work-from-home networks is surging, positioning Asian tech firms for a slow but steady recovery, their early quarterly report cards showed.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) guided on Tuesday to a better-than-expected first-quarter profit, as data centres stacked up on memory chips to deal with a rise in virtual meetings.
And Apple Inc  supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) reported on Monday a drop in March-quarter sales that was slightly smaller than it had first estimated.
As well, news that the number of new COVID-19 cases were receding in Europe and starting to plateau in some parts of the United States - big markets for Asian tech companies - fuelled gains in Asian shares on Tuesday. Mainland China reported a drop in new cases as well.
""Within Asia, developing signs of industry returning to work tell us that production in China will be the first part of the economy to lift off,"" Stephen Innes, global chief market strategist at forex trader Axicorp, said in a note.
Shares in Samsung, also a maker of smartphones and TVs, rose 2% on Tuesday. Foxconn stock rose 1.4%.
LG Electronics (KS:066570) shares jumped nearly 7% after the South Korean TV and phonemaker said operating profit likely soared 21% in the March quarter.
The pandemic, that has killed more than 74,000 people globally and infected over 1.32 million, has forced countries to curb travel and movement, pushed airlines to the brink and disrupted global supply chains.
But as work from home has surged, boosting demand for cloud services, so has the requirement for memory chips. This has allowed chipmakers such as Samsung to lower their high stockpile that squeezed prices for many quarters.
""The memory chip market is on the verge of a rebound ... especially the server DRAM memory chip market is rebounding faster than expected following a downturn as data center customers are buying up memory chips to build up their infrastructures,"" said Song Myeong-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities. 
CHINA DEMAND
Smartphone sales in China are also expected to edge up in the coming months as stores have reopened, and companies are hopeful of strong demand for 5G-enabled phones.
Chinese smartphone maker  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) said last week it expects to see signs of a recovery in May.
Still, global demand for smartphones is likely to remain weak as countries reel from the economic impact of the virus, which could include millions of job losses.
In China, demand had begun to return in late February, but there were some supply problems, said Mo Jia who tracks the global smartphone sector at UK-based research firm Canalys.
""And then when the supply side was back up, overseas markets like Europe began to suffer,"" he said.
Counterpoint Research estimates global smartphone sales fell 14% in February, and expects a steeper decline after that.
Samsung, which will report January-March results later this month, is expected a post a bigger hit to its mobile and consumer electronics sales.
Foxconn, which said last month it expected to resume normal production in China by the end of March, warned it does not expect to see any revenue growth in the first half of this year.
But the company, formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry, told investors last week it can still get the latest 5G-enabled iPhones ready for an autumn launch, according to Bloomberg https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/foxconn-assures-investors-5g-iphone-can-still-launch-this-fall.
""Although we believe Hon Hai is not immune to the COVID-19 impact in the near term, we remain positive for its long-term margin uptrends,"" Daiwa Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note, adding they expect the company s margins to rise from the second half of 2020.

The Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer had to shut factories in China where it assembles iPhones, leading Apple to say it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales guidance."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s public health authority launched a smartwatch app on Tuesday in partnership with healthtech startup Thryve to help monitor the spread of COVID-19 and analyse whether measures to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic are working.
The Corona-Datenspende https://corona-datenspende.de (Corona Data Donation) app gathers vital signs from volunteers wearing smartwatches or fitness trackers - including pulse, temperature and sleep - to analyse whether they are symptomatic of the flu-like illness.
Results will be represented in an interactive online map that would make it possible - together with other data inputs - for the health authorities and the general public to assess the prevalence of infections down to postcode level.
""If the sample is big enough to capture enough symptomatic patients, that would help us to draw conclusions on how infections are spreading and whether containment measures are working,"" said Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute that is coordinating Germany s coronavirus response.
Germany has the fourth highest COVID-19 caseload behind the United States, Spain and Italy at nearly 100,000 but has kept fatalities down to a relatively low 1,600 thanks to early and extensive testing.
The German authorities have been more cautious than some Asian countries in using digital technology to fight the coronavirus, restrained by Europe s strict data privacy laws and mindful of public scepticism towards any surveillance reminiscent of Nazi- or communist-era rule.
But a similar approach has been used here to model the spread of influenza while, in the United States, connected  smart  thermometers distributed by Kinsa Health have offered early insights into how quickly COVID-19 is spreading, the New York Times reported https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-fever-thermometers.html last month.
READY TO GO
The Corona Data Donation app, available for download in the Google  Play Store and Apple  App Store, is voluntary and data would be processed anonymously. To register, users should enter their postcode, age, sex, height and weight.
Data shared by their connected devices would be monitored on an ongoing basis, with telltale readings such as a high temperature or disturbed sleep indicating whether an individual may have come down with COVID-19.
Project leader Dirk Brockmann said he hoped 100,000 people - or 10% of Germany s smartwatch and fitness tracker users - would sign up. Even 10,000 would be analytically useful, he added.
The Corona Data Donation app was developed in four weeks in partnership with Berlin-based startup Thryve https://thryve.health, a data-driven  wearable health  startup which realised earlier this year that its approach could be adapted to detect COVID-19.
Thryve approached the Robert Koch Institute with its findings, said spokesman Sebastian Wochnik. ""Their epidemiologists really liked this unique solution. With more data, their models obviously work better,"" he said.
Thryve was founded in 2017 as a commercial spin-off from the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research, one of 72 applied research groups under the umbrella of Germany s Fraunhofer Society.

Another branch of the Fraunhofer Society is involved in developing a European technology platform to support smartphone apps that would use Bluetooth connections between devices to help trace and warn those at risk."

The app is currently available only on Apple  s App Store in the United States and Canada, according to data from industry site Sensor Tower.
The Information, which first reported the news, said the product was made by a small team inside Facebook called New Product Experimentation (NPE) team, which is tasked with building new social media products from scratch. 
NPE describes the app as ""a private space where you and your significant other can just be yourselves"".

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California s Santa Clara County, the technology hub hit hard by some of the first American cases of the coronavirus, dramatically slowed the illness with early and aggressive shelter-at-home rules, public health officer Sara Cody said on Tuesday.
The county of about 2 million people, located south of San Francisco, was initially on track to develop an estimated 50,000 cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus ravaging communities across the globe, by May 1. It now may have just 2,500 to 12,000, Cody told a meeting of the Santa Clara Board of Supervisors. 
The number of cases has gone from doubling every three days in early March, to now doubling approximately every two weeks, she said.
""The trend is exactly what we want to see,"" Cody said. ""We are slowing things down.""
Pushed by Cody, six San Francisco Bay Area counties on March 16 ordered residents to stay home for all but essential needs. Three days later, California Governor Gavin Newsom imposed a similar order statewide.
Those actions, the most restrictive clamp-down up to that point in the United States, helped slow the virus  progress in the most populous U.S. state, giving hospitals and medical teams time to prepare for an expected onslaught of sick patients needing hospital beds, intensive care and ventilators to help them breathe.
CURVE RISING MORE SLOWLY
The few extra days that residents of Santa Clara -- which is home to the headquarters of Apple , Google  and Facebook , among others -- and the other San Francisco Bay Area counties had to shelter in place may help explain why the virus  onslaught in the heavily populated region appears to have slowed earlier than in hard-hit Los Angeles County in Southern  California.
By Tuesday morning, Santa Clara, San Francisco and the four other Bay Area counties reported 3,532 cases of COVID-19 in a population of about 6.7 million, or about one in every 1,900 people. In Los Angeles County, with a population of about 10 million, 6,391 people have tested positive for the disease, about one in every 1,600 people. 
The disease has progressed more slowly in California than in New York state, where 140,086 infections have been confirmed even as the steep rise in cases appeared to plateau on Tuesday.
In California, 15,865 people had tested positive for COVID-19 by Tuesday morning, a 10.7% increase over the previous day. But the number of people who were hospitalized increased just 4.1% from the prior day to 2,611, and the number in intensive care increased just 2.1% to 1,108.
“The curve continues to rise but now it is slower,"" Newsom said.
Cody said it would take more than an apparent slowing of cases to persuade public health officials it was time to ease social restrictions.

Before that can happen, hospitals across the county would need to have enough beds and ventilators for all patients. Testing and public health tracking needs to be broadly available. And the number of new cases has to decline steadily over a period of at least two weeks, she said."

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is best known for assembling Apple  s iPhones at factories in China.
In a statement released through company founder Terry Gou s office, Foxconn said it was currently cooperating with Medtronic to design and develop ventilators, and medical and technical personnel from both firms were working closely on this.
The companies hope to speed up production time so the ventilators can be put to work as soon as possible, it added.
Medtronic Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak told CNBC that Foxconn s Wisconsin plant would be used to make the ventilators.
Other companies in the United States are also rushing to make ventilators as the coronavirus spreads rapidly there.

Ford Motor  Co said last week it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with  General Electric   s healthcare unit, and can then build 30,000 per month as needed to treat patients infected by the coronavirus. "

NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies laying off workers in response to the coronavirus pandemic but still paying dividends and buying back shares are drawing criticism from labor unions, pension fund advisers, lawmakers and corporate governance experts.
While most U.S. companies are scaling back payouts after a decade in which the amount of money paid to investors through buybacks and dividends more than tripled, some are maintaining their policies despite the economic pain.
 Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd ,  Halliburton Co  , General Motors Co  and McDonald s Corp  have all laid off staff, cut their hours, or slashed salaries while maintaining payouts, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings, company announcements and company officials.
""This is the time for large companies to try to help, for systemic reasons, to keep things flowing,"" said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors. The council s members include public pension funds and endowments that manage assets worth about $4 trillion.
Royal Caribbean, which has halted its cruises in response to the pandemic and borrowed to boost its liquidity to more than $3.6 billion, said it began laying off contract workers in mid-March, though the moves did not affect its full-time employees.
The company has not suspended its remaining $600 million share buyback program, which expires in May, or its dividend, which totaled $602 million last year and is set quarterly.
""We continue to take decisive actions to protect (our) financial and liquidity positions,"" Royal Caribbean spokesman Jonathon Fishman said. He declined to comment specifically on the layoffs or shareholder payouts.
While Royal Caribbean s rival Carnival Corp  has also laid off contract workers, it has suspended dividends and buybacks as it raised more than $6 billion in capital markets to weather the coronavirus storm.
UNEMPLOYMENT SURGE
Goldman Sachs  analysts forecast this week that S&P 500 companies would cut dividends in 2020 by an average of 50% because of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

While there has been criticism of companies maintaining investor payouts, only those receiving financial support from the U.S. government under a $2.3 trillion stimulus package are obliged to suspend share buybacks.
Layoffs contributed to U.S. unemployment skyrocketing last month. Jobless claims topped 6.6 million in the week ended March 28 - double the record set the prior week and far above the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
Companies say job cuts are necessary to offset a plunge in revenue but their critics say they should consider turning off the spigots to shareholders before letting employees go.
""If companies are paying dividends and doing buybacks, they do not have to lay off workers,"" said William Lazonick, a corporate governance expert at the University of Massachusetts.
Workers at franchised McDonald s restaurants say they are getting fewer shifts since dining areas were closed in March, leaving only carry-out and drive-through services open.
Alma Ceballos, 31, who has worked at a franchised McDonald s near San Francisco for 14 years, said she could not pay her rent after her schedule was cut to 16 hours from 40 and her husband, a janitor at Apple Inc s  Cupertino, California, campus was laid off.
McDonald s, which has suspended buybacks but maintained its annual dividend, worth $3.6 billion in 2019, told Reuters its staffing and opening hours were not related to ""making a choice between employees and dividends"".
About 95% of its U.S. restaurants are run by franchisees who decide staffing. McDonald s said it was offering rent deferrals and other help to keep franchises open and employing workers.
""McDonald s could commit to 30 days of income for all workers,"" Mary Kay Henry, president of the labor union SEIU which has 2 million members, said in an interview with Reuters. ""Corporations need to pay their fair share here.""
 IT S JUST WRONG 
General Motors has halted normal production in North America and temporarily reduced cash pay for salaried workers by 20%. It paid its first-quarter dividend on March 20 and has a month before declaring its next dividend, a spokeswoman said, adding that GM would assess economic conditions before deciding.
""Our focus in the near term is to protect the health of our employees and customers, ensure we have ample liquidity for a very wide range of scenarios, and implement austerity measures to preserve cash,"" spokeswoman Lauren Langille said.
Oilfield services firm Halliburton furloughed about 3,500 workers in its Houston office starting on March 23, according to a letter sent to the Texas Workforce Commission obtained by Reuters. It has also cut 350 positions in Oklahoma.
Halliburton cited disruption from the coronavirus as well as plunging oil prices as the reason for the furlough. In March, it paid its first-quarter dividend to shareholders as planned.
A Halliburton spokeswoman declined to comment on the furlough and the company s dividend policy. 
Some of the companies laying off workers while still paying out shareholders, such as General Motors, signed an initiative last year from the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives, pledging to make business decisions in the interest of employees and other stakeholders, not just shareholders.
Large asset managers such as BlackRock  and Vanguard have cited managing ""human capital"" as a priority for companies in which they invest. Yet they have been reluctant to publicly press companies to avoid layoffs during the crisis.
Vanguard told Reuters it ""recognizes the need for companies to exercise judgment and flexibility as they balance short- and long-term business considerations"". 
BlackRock did not respond with a statement when contacted for comment.
""Profits should be shared with the workers who actually create them,"" U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, a long-standing critic of share buybacks, told Reuters in an email.

""It s just wrong for big corporations to reward the wealthy or top executives with more stock buybacks, while closing facilities and laying off workers."""
569,https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/chinese-online-retailers-offer-discounts-on-iphone-11-as-country-recovers-from-coronavirus-2135738,2020-04-09,Chinese online retailers offer discounts on iPhone 11 as country recovers from coronavirus By Reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Several Chinese online retailers have offered discounts on Apple Inc  s iPhone 11, Reuters checks on Thursday revealed.
The price drops come as the hardware company braces for an uncertain year for the smartphone sector, as the global spread of the coronavirus dampens demand while Chinese rivals rush out 5G models.
The online store for Suning, a popular Chinese electronics vendor, offers the 64GB version of the iPhone 11 for 4999 yuan ($707.54), a discount of 500 yuan from the price listed on Apple s official China Website.
The 64GB version of the iPhone 11 Pro Max, meanwhile, sells for 7499 yuan ($1,061.38), a discount of 1600 yuan from the price on Apple s China website.
Other e-commerce vendors, including JD.com, Gome, and Dangdang, as well as several authorised Apple resellers on Tmall, the popular site run by  Alibaba   Group Holding Ltd, offer similar price cuts.
For a time, Apple granted little leeway for its Chinese third-party sellers to lower prices. 
But in early 2019, several Chinese e-commerce cites dropped prices on number of iPhone models. The cuts arrived as the company faced weak demand in China, in part because of competition from domestic rivals.
Apple s Tim Cook later said the cuts played a role in helping the company recover sales in China.
The latest round of price cuts comes as Apple prepares for the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
In February, as the virus peaked in China, Cook warned investors that the company would not meet its revenue guidance for the coming quarter amid disruption of both the Chinese supply chain and consumer demand there.
Data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a branch of the Chinese government, revealed that Apple shipped fewer than 500,000 phones in China that month.
Mo Jia, who tracks the global smartphone industry at research firm Canalys, said that although some smartphone brands have seen sales in China recover as the virus subsides in the country, Apple is not yet one of them.
He attributes the delayed uptake to Chinese brands  swift rollout of 5G devices, as consumers who are ready to purchase new phones want models compatible with the country s upgraded telecommunications networks.

""Apple only offers 4G phones and they are expensive compared to their counterparts,"" Jia said. "

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Nintendo Switch video game has been pulled off China s grey market e-commerce platforms, Reuters  checks show, after Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong used the game to protest against Beijing’s rule of the Chinese territory.
The game, ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"", is a colourful social simulator in which players can decorate their own island and invite others to visit. It became an instant hit after its launch last month and has been used by many players to interact and simulate real-life scenarios while they are stuck at home because of measures to curb the coronavirus outbreak.
Joshua Wong, a Hong Kong democracy activist, took his protests to the game last week and on Twitter posted a screenshot of his island decorated with a banner saying: ""Free Hong Kong, revolution now.""
China has stringent rules on content from everything from video games to movies and music, censoring anything it believes violates core socialist values. Gaming companies must also seek licences for the games they want to publish.
Nintendo launched console sales in China with tech giant Tencent in December, but players in China can only access multiplayer connections for games such as Animal Crossing via foreign editions available on the grey market via platforms such as Pinduoduo and Taobao.
However, since Joshua Wong s Twitter post, searches for ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" have showed no results on Pinduoduo. On  Alibaba   s Taobao, some vendors are trying to circumvent the crackdown by directing potential buyers towards listings that sell the game without using its title in the description.
Some Animal Crossing players in China have created scenarios that mirror the real world, with temperature check points and avatars wearing face masks.
Joshua Wong has since shared pictures of his island showing portraits of Chinese President Xi Jinping and World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom at a funeral simulation with a sign saying ""Wuhan pneumonia"".
""This is what we do in #AnimalCrossing ... maybe it s why these people are so anxious to go back to the game!!"" he said on Twitter.
It is not clear whether the pulling of the game is a directive from China s content regulator or a voluntary act by politically sensitive e-commerce platforms. 
Alibaba and Pinduoduo representatives were not immediately available for comment on Friday afternoon.
In February video game ""Plague Inc"", where players create a pathogen to destroy the world, was removed from Apple  s Chinese app store after regulators said it contained illegal content.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As American Christians began Easter weekend under threat of the coronavirus, political leaders and health experts on Friday cautioned the faithful not to gather in churches or relax social distancing practices.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government s top infectious disease expert and other health officials pointed to declining rates of coronavirus hospitalizations and need for intensive care - particularly in hardest-hit New York - as signs that social distancing measures are paying off.
""Now is no time to back off,"" Fauci told CNN on Friday. ""The virus will decide"" when the country can reopen, he added.
Those measures continue to take an enormous toll on the economy - some economists are forecasting job losses of up to 20 million in April - raising questions about how long business closures and travel restrictions can be sustained.
However, were U.S. officials to lift shelter-in-place orders after 30 days, the nation s death total could reach 200,000, the New York Times reported, citing new projections from the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. An influential university model this week had lowered the U.S. death projection to 60,000 if social distancing continued. 
The United States has by far the world s most confirmed coronavirus cases, at more than 485,000, with over 18,100 deaths. Only Italy has had more fatalities.
After three days of record daily death rates, New York state s COVID-19 tally was 777 on April 9, down from 799 deaths a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported on Friday. But New York s intensive care unit admissions declined ""for the first time since we started this journey,"" he said.
In Michigan, more than 200 people died from COVID-19 in the last day. ""We are not out of the woods yet,"" Governor Gretchen Whitmer said.
At his daily White House briefing, however, President Donald Trump said he was getting fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.
Meanwhile, with more than 90% of the country under stay-at-home orders, the holiest weekend on the Christian calendar began with services livestreamed or broadcast. Many churches sat empty on Good Friday, when they would typically be overflowing with worshippers.
""We gather normally at Easter to worship. We gather for children s Easter egg hunts, for family meals, with friends. We can t do any of that this year,"" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy at his daily coronavirus briefing.
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, on CNN, also urged people not to attend church. ""You can express your faith in lots of different ways, but it can t be by congregating.""
Churches are devising different ways to reach the faithful. One megachurch in South Carolina is turning to the model of once popular drive-in movies, with services shown on a big screen and broadcast via radio to worshippers in their cars. 
A handful of holdout U.S. churches plan to hold in-person services on Easter Sunday, saying their right to worship in person outweighs public health officials  warnings that they may be spreading more than just the Gospel by holding large gatherings.
""Satan and a virus will not stop us,"" said the Reverend Tony Spell, pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He expects more than 2,000 to gather at his megachurch on Sunday.
FOOD DRIVE DRAWS THOUSANDS
Friday also ends another week of missed paychecks for millions of Americans, with restaurants, businesses, entertainment venues and schools shuttered across the nation.
In Los Angeles, some 5,000 families waited at the city s Forum arena to pick up food in a Good Friday donation drive.
“This is slated to be our biggest distribution to date,” said Michael Flood, head of the LA Regional Food Bank. ""It s continuing to demonstrate just how many families and individuals the current economic conditions have hit.""
New York plans to open coronavirus testing sites in five minority neighborhoods to improve testing in a population that has been hit disproportionately hard. Several U.S. states have reported COVID-19 deaths among blacks and Hispanics far higher than their portion of the population.
""African Americans comprise 70% of the deaths but only comprise about 33% of the state s population,"" said Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state has reported 755 deaths.
Google  said it would work with Apple  to create contact tracing technology that alerts people when they have been in close proximity with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, the sometimes deadly respiratory illness caused by the virus.
Another group pummeled by the virus are prison inmates with hundreds of infections and several deaths reported among inmates in Chicago, New York and Louisiana.
New Jersey s Murphy said he signed an executive order to expedite parole for inmates who pose a low public risk.
Despite some reasons for optimism, healthcare workers in New York and other coronavirus hotspots have seen a wave of demoralizing deaths this week. 
Emily Muzyka, a nurse at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, has held patients  hands through final breaths in the past, but things have changed.
""If I have to do that now,"" she said, ""it will be through gloves.""

572,https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/apple-google-to-create-contact-tracing-technology-to-fight-coronavirus-spread-2137339,2020-04-11,"Apple, Google plan software to slow virus, joining global debate on tracking By Reuters","By Stephen Nellis and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Apple Inc  and Alphabet Inc s  Google said on Friday that they will work together to create contact tracing technology that aims to slow the spread of the coronavirus by allowing users to opt into logging other phones they have been near. 
The rare collaboration between the two Silicon Valley companies, whose operating systems power 99% of the world s smartphones, could accelerate usage of apps that aim to get potentially infected individuals into testing or quarantine more quickly and reliably than existing systems in much of the world. Such tracing will play a vital role in managing the virus once lockdown orders end, health experts say. 
The planned technology also throws the weight of the tech leaders into a global conflict between privacy advocates who favor a decentralized system to trace contacts and governments in Europe and Asia pushing centralized approaches that have technical weaknesses and potentially let governments know with whom people associate. 
""With Apple and Google, you get all the public health functions you need with a decentralized and privacy-friendly app,"" said Michael Veale, University College London legal lecturer involved in European contact tracing system DP3T. Centralized solutions such as those proposed in Britain and Germany would no longer work under the new technology, he said.
To be effective, the Silicon Valley system would require millions of people to opt in the system, trusting the technology companies’ safeguards, as well as smooth oversight by public health systems. 
The companies said they started developing the technology two weeks ago to streamline technical differences between Apple s iPhones and Google s Android that had stymied the interoperation of some existing contact tracing apps. 
Under the plan, users  phones with the technology will emit unique Bluetooth signals. Phones within about six feet can record anonymous information about encounters. 
People who test positive for the virus can opt to send an encrypted list of phones they came near to Apple and Google, which will trigger alerts to potentially exposed users to seek more information. Public health authorities would need to sign off that an individual has tested positive before they can send on the data. 
The logs will be scrambled to keep infected individuals  data anonymous, even to Apple, Google and contact tracing app makers, the companies said. Apple and Google said their contact tracing system will not track GPS location.
""To their credit, Apple and Google have announced an approach that appears to mitigate the worst privacy and centralization risks,"" Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said.
She added that the companies could have more safeguards such as specifying that contract tracing features would not be used beyond the current pandemic.
NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR TESTING
Apple and Google plan to release software tools in mid-May to contact tracing apps that they and public health authorities approve. Apps including Private Kit and CoEpi, which had contacted Apple and Google for help a month ago, said the new tools would enable them to drop potentially unreliable workarounds. 
Apps will be able to focus on developing a simple interface for users and healthcare workers, with Apple and Google handling Bluetooth and privacy issues, said Dana Lewis, a lead developer of contact tracing app CoEpi. 
However, Apple and Google plan to release software updates in the coming months so that users do not need a separate app to log nearby phones. 
Google said the tools and updates would not be available where its services are blocked, such as in China or on unofficial Android devices. Apple will distribute the technology as an update to its iPhone operating system. 
A median of 76% of people in United States and other advanced economies have smartphones, according to a Pew Research Center study last year, compared with a median of 45% in emerging economies. 
Governments worldwide have been scrambling to adopt software meant to improve the normally labor-intensive process of contact tracing, in which health officials go to recent contacts of an infected person and ask them to self-quarantine or get tested. 
""It s very interesting, but a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person s freedom. We re going to take a look at that, a very strong look at that,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing when asked about Apple and Google s efforts. 
Health experts have credited extensive testing and contact tracing with slowing the spread of the virus in nations such as South Korea, but limited testing has held back contact tracing in the United States. 
For instance, New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told Reuters on Friday that tracing will not be helpful until the virus is controlled, with apps potentially proving expedient when someone has crossed paths with many people. 

""This isn t a substitute for testing - you need to know who has it - but it produces actionable results so people can act responsibly, self-isolate and reduce anxiety in the community as a whole,"" said Al Gidari, a Stanford University law school lecturer and previously long-time external counsel to Google."

Smartphone companies are hoping for a strong recovery in demand in China, where the deadly coronavirus is subsiding, just as it spreads overseas and looks set to trigger a global recession.
Mobile phone shipments in China in March totalled 21 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a government think tank. 
That was a more than three-fold increase from February, yet still down roughly 20% compared with March 2019.
Chinese retailers largely resumed operations by early March, with brick-and-mortar outlets re-opening and e-commerce logistics getting back in gear after the virus and tough containment measures brought much of the economy to a standstill in the first two months.
Apple shipped roughly 500,000 phones in China in February, according to the CAICT.
Many smartphone makers are now hoping that sales in China can cushion declines in overseas markets in coming months.
In its quarterly earnings call, the then-CFO of  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) said that the Chinese market had recovered to roughly 80% of its normal levels.
The company later wrote a letter to the government of India, one of its largest markets, requesting that it consider smartphones an essential commodity and therefore exempt from shipping restrictions.
Earlier this month several Chinese online retailers slashed prices on iPhone 11 models. Apple has let third-party sellers in China offer discounts in the past in order to spur demand.
The company announces its quarterly earnings results on April 30.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe should not cede its sovereignty to Silicon Valley when it comes to using technology to help trace those at risk of coronavirus infection, the German developers of a smartphone app said on Tuesday.
Apple  and Google  said last week that they would collaborate on technology to track electronic  handshakes  between devices that come into close proximity as a way to follow the risk of infection.
While any steps to improve the technology are welcome, maintaining control over data in ecosystems that already run 99% of the world s smartphone isn t, said Julian Teicke, a leader of Germany s Healthy Together https://gesund-zusammen.de/en startup initiative.
""We do not think it is the best solution that Google and Apple own the server on which all the contacts plus the medical status of citizens around the world are uploaded,"" Teicke, founder and chief executive of insurance tech firm Wefox Group, told Reuters.
""What we need is an independent party that allows governments some kind of control over what happens with this medical and contact data.""
The rare collaboration between the two Silicon Valley giants comes as attempts are being made to repurpose Bluetooth wireless technology to support smartphone apps that could measure whether individuals have been in close enough contact to transmit coronavirus.
Such apps could help enable a shift away from economically disruptive lockdowns and towards issuing more targeted warnings to those at risk to see a doctor or self-isolate.
Doing so in a way that meets the European Union s strict privacy laws poses great challenges and debate is raging over the merits of the  decentralized  approach backed by Apple and Google, and the centralised modes favoured by many governments in which data is hosted on dedicated servers.
Apple and Google reiterated on Monday that they will not be storing any data online. Instead, their servers would relay scrambled messages between smartphones and only the phones themselves could unscramble them. The companies added that they plan to allow health authorities to control the relay servers if desired.
One centralized platform in development - the German-led Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT https://www.pepp-pt.org) - would support national contact tracing apps that could  talk  to each other across borders.
Healthy Together is racing to complete work on a PEPP-PT compliant app that it hopes would be downloaded by 50 million Germans. The alliance is in touch with Chancellor Angela Merkel s government but no decision has been made on which would become the  official  national app, Teicke said.
He welcomed plans by Apple and Google to release standardized plug-ins in May to enable interoperability between iOS and Android devices, even if this would come late for those apps seeking to make an earlier start.

Teicke was more concerned, however, about the two U.S. companies  move to subsequently build Bluetooth contact-tracing into their core operating systems. ""Data needs to be sent to a neutral place - not to Apple and Google,"" he said."

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - A global race is on to develop smartphone apps and other types of mobile phone surveillance systems to track and contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The process known as ""contact tracing,"" which is used to control the spread of infectious diseases, was boosted last week when the top two smartphone software makers, Alphabet Inc s Google  and Apple Inc , said they were collaborating on apps that can identify people who have crossed paths with a contagious patient and alert them.
HOW CAN MOBILE PHONES HELP COMBAT THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?
Smartphones and some less-sophisticated mobile phones keep track of their location via cell-tower signals, Wi-Fi signals and the satellite-based global positioning system, known as GPS. Smartphones also use so-called Bluetooth technology to connect with nearby devices. 
The location data can be used to monitor whether people, either individually or in aggregate, are obeying orders to stay inside their homes. It can also be used for contact tracing: determining whether people have been in contact with others who have the virus, so they can get tested or quarantined.
Smartphones can also be used to take surveys of people about their health via messaging, record their health histories via various forms of data entry and even produce a health ""score"" based on a combination of location information and health data.
HOW CAN PHONES HELP WITH CONTACT TRACING?
Using Bluetooth, smartphones can log other phones they have been near. If someone becomes infected, there is a ready list of their prior encounters. Phones on the list would get push notifications urging them to get tested or self-isolate.
In principle, this system is more efficient than traditional contact tracing methods that require large staffs to interview patients about their travels and then call or knock on the doors of contacts.
The Bluetooth solution is far from perfect. Phones can log one another even when 15 feet apart or on separate sides of a wall, even though a cough from an infected person likely would not be problematic in those cases. But developers have been working on ways to better define ""contacts"" based on the length and strength of so-called handshakes between devices.
Bluetooth also remains more accurate than GPS or cell tower location data, which can wrongly associate everyone on a busy city block as contacts.
ARE ANY OF THESE METHODS CURRENTLY IN USE?
Singapore pioneered contact tracing via Bluetooth with an app called ""TraceTogether."" Israel, which made headlines by employing its powerful government surveillance system to track cases, has also rolled out an app called The Shield. India also has an app.
South Korea is using mobile phone location data for contact tracing, while Taiwan uses it for quarantine enforcement and is also developing an app. China is employing a range of app-based tracking systems.
Meanwhile, dozens of efforts to develop contact tracing apps are underway around the world, many led by government research institutes and health authorities. In Europe, for example, a German-led effort is aiming to rally other European countries behind a technology platform that could support contact tracing apps across the 27-member EU. But several other European countries are pursuing their own apps. An effort is also underway in the United Kingdom.
The United States government has yet to promote an app, but at least two university research groups and one ad-hoc software development team are trying to gain endorsements from state and local bodies. 
HOW DO APPLE AND GOOGLE FIT IN?
The two companies said they were concerned about competing approaches and agreed to develop tools, to be released in May, that will enable apps to ""handshake"" with one other. They also address battery drain and other issues that have limited the utility of some early apps.
Apple and Google also plan to go a step further later this year by integrating logging functionality directly into their phone software nearly worldwide. 
People who catch the virus would still need to download an app to initiate contact notifications, but even those without apps could receive notifications.
ARE THERE PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONCERNS?
Yes. The most sensitive issue is who can view a phone s list of devices it has crossed. Nearly everyone agrees on deleting logs after about one month.
The tools coming from Google and Apple keep names off contact lists and leave the lists secret to everyone involved, which has drawn plaudits from privacy experts. Only governments, which must verify that people who say they tested positive for coronavirus actually did so, would know the identity of disease carriers, and even they would not have access to the contact lists.
But some governments and technologists favor collecting a central database of all ""handshakes"" between phones because it is an easier system to design and manage. Privacy advocates worry that such a database would be a hackers  goldmine and prone to governmental abuse.
Some researchers have suggested apps also track GPS information to better map the spread of the coronavirus. But GPS data could undermine people s privacy and leave places visited by people who test positive ostracized, activists said.
WILL PEOPLE BE REQUIRED TO TURN ON CONTACT TRACING?
No country is known to have required an app, but workplaces or other facilities could end up mandating usage. Apple and Google said that apps seeking to use its tools would need to be voluntary.
But the apps won t achieve their purpose unless they are widely used. Some epidemiologists have said at least 60% of a country needs to activate digital contact tracing for it make an impact.

Investing.com – Wall Street traded near session highs on Tuesday as investors seemingly upped bets on large-cap tech stocks that are well equipped to benefit from an eventual economic restart, even as the first wave of quarterly earnings indicated there is plenty of coronavirus-led uncertainty ahead.
The Dow jumped 2.23%, or 521 points, theS&P 500 gained 3.01% and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.94%.
The recent wave of optimism on the economy reopening sooner rather than later appears to have drummed up investor appetite for technology stocks that had led the previous bull market, with FAANG names, in particular, up sharply.
Facebook , Apple , Amazon , Netflix  and Google parent Alphabet  rallied more than 4%, with investors appearing to favor companies with strong liquidity at a time when the current pandemic has many firms scrambling to save cash.
""A weak balance sheet means going out of business,"" Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures told The Telegraph in March. ""The FAANG companies are all huge cash producers.""
Consumer discretionaries also contributed to the wave of green across Wall Street, led by Tesla.
Tesla  surged 12% after  Credit Suisse   upgraded its rating on the stock to outperform from neutral and hiked its price target on the stock to $580 from $415.
Financials, however, lagged the broader market rally, as quarterly results from banking stocks flagged further economic pain ahead.
JPMorgan Chase  and  Wells Fargo  NYSE:WFC) reported a widely-expected slump in first-quarter profits as they put aside billions of dollars for a potential flurry of loan defaults from customers. Johnson & Johnson , meanwhile, surged 4.6% after reported a jump in profit, led by increased demand for over-the-counter medicine.
Earnings aside, investor optimism on an economic restart sooner rather later has also supported sentiment, with governors across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island expressing a willingness to work together on reopening plans.
Calls for the economy to restart have been underpinned by signs of slowing infections in hotspots like New York, which is the epicenter of the global pandemic, with gross new daily hospitalizations in the state slowing to 1,649 from 1,958 a day earlier, the lowest since March 24.
Against the backdrop of recent optimism, however, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday that a May 1 target date for reopening the economy was ""a bit overly optimistic,"" Reuters reported."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  said on Tuesday it would release data that could help inform public health authorities on whether people are driving less during lockdown orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The data is gathered by counting the number of routing requests from Apple Maps, which is installed on all iPhones, and comparing it with past usage to detect changes in the volume of people driving, walking or taking public transit around the world, Apple said.
The information is being updated daily and compared with a date in mid-January, before most U.S. lockdown measures were in place, Apple said. More than 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders and various lockdowns are underway in other countries around the globe.
The data would be aggregated so that requests from individual users would not be shown, and it does not track individual users or their locations, the company said.
The information, available on a public website https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility , will show changes for major cities and 63 countries or regions, Apple said.
In the San Francisco Bay area, requests for driving directions as of April 12 were down 70% versus Jan. 13, and requests for transit directions plunged 84%, the data showed. In New York City, driving direction requests were down 69% and transit requests were down 89%.
Public health officials in California said April 11 they were using data to track the effectiveness of the state s lockdown order, although they did not say whether they were using Apple data.
Apple does not provide the absolute number of requests or a specific number of people moving, instead expressing the data as a percentage of requests compared with its mid-January baseline. 
Aggregate data helps to protect identity and still identifies individual travel patterns thus avoiding some of the mistakes of countries like South Korea, criticized for privacy violations, said Jason Farley, professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing. 
Farley, who is an infectious disease-trained nurse epidemiologist, said the data from the app offers insights into movement right now, yet its impact on maintaining social distancing and making public health decision remains unclear. 
Apple s data is more limited than what Alphabet Inc s  Google has made available to public health officials.
Google nearly two weeks ago released data on more than 131 countries, comparing trips in recent weeks to recreational venues, train and bus stations, grocery stores and workplaces with a five-week period earlier this year. 
For several countries, Google offers county-level data, which is helpful in countries such as the United States where lockdown orders are issued by county officials.
The Apple data, by contrast, shows only data for some cities, regions and countries and does not show results for entire U.S. states, including those without lockdown orders such as North and South Dakota.
The Apple data also does not capture trips where the user has not asked for directions from the Maps.

Apple said it is continuing to work with public health officials to identify what other data types or trends may be helpful. "

Investing.com – The Dow racked up gains on Tuesday, as investors weighed up the prospect of an eventual economic restart against earnings from banks that point toward further coronavirus-induced pain for the economy.
The Dow jumped 2.39%, or 559 points, theS&P 500 gained 3.06% and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.95%.
Growing signs that some of the Covid-19 hotspots in the country like New York appear to be winning the battle to slow the pandemic have increased calls for the economy to reopen, boosting investor sentiment on risk.
Gross new daily hospitalizations in New York state fell to 1,649 from 1,958 a day earlier, the lowest since March 24, with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently suggesting the worst of the pandemic was over.
Governors across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island said they would work together on reopening plans.
But the reopening of the U.S. is unlikely to avert a widely-expected slump in global growth.
The International Monetary Fund said it now expects the global economy to contract by 3% in 2020, compared with a previous estimate for global GDP to expand 3.3% for this year.
Earnings from JPMorgan  and  Wells Fargo   underscored the expected economic damage that lies ahead as both banks reported a steep contraction in earnings on loan loss provisions and warned they may need to sock away more money to offset anticipated loan defaults from customers.
Bucking the trend of weaker earnings, Johnson & Johnson  rasied its dividend and reported a jump in profit, led by increased demand for over-the-counter medicine.
The rally on Wall Street was led by technology, with FAANG and chip stocks catching a strong bid.
Facebook , Apple , Amazon , Netflix  and Google parent Alphabet  rallied more than 3%."

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government should seek every mechanism to prevent the removal of the technology base of Imagination Technologies to China, including seeking a Western buyer for the company, British lawmaker David Davis said on Tuesday.
Imagination Technologies licenses its semiconductor chip designs that are the basic units powering everything from smartphones to computer game consoles. They are also used in artificial intelligence and data transfer.
The company, which like larger rival ARM Holdings  was a jewel in Britain s technological crown, was bought by private equity firm Canyon Bridge in 2017.
Canyon Bridge is in turn backed by Chinese state-owned China Reform holdings, which had tried to wrest control of the group by seeking to appoint board members who will support them.
A board meeting due to take place last Tuesday was delayed after the British government intervened, the government said. 
Ron Black stepped down as chief executive on Friday, the company said.
""What we think is going on is the Chinese are trying to export the technology base from here to China and that s inappropriate,"" Davis, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Boris Johnson s Conservative Party, told Reuters.
An Imagination Technologies spokesman declined to comment.
Davis said Imagination, a supplier of semiconductor intellectual property to groups like Apple  , was a strategic asset and that the government should make it absolutely plain that it does not view the export of such important British technology with equanimity.
""It should probably try to bring about a purchase of it by somebody else in a Western country,"" Davis said. ""The government should be seeking every mechanism available to them to prevent this removal of our technology - full stop.""
The sale of Imagination Technologies, founded in 1985, was approved by the government of then-Prime Minister Theresa May on the basis that Canyon Bridge would be subject to U.S. law. 
Canyon Bridge was originally incorporated in the United States but has since moved to the Cayman Islands, a spokesman said.
The sale of Imagination in 2017 came after its biggest customer Apple said it would stop using its graphics technology.
Just before the 550-million-pound deal was agreed, Canyon Bridge was blocked from buying chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp for $1.3 billion by U.S. President Donald Trump, amid concerns the deal posed a threat to national security.
The move foreshadowed the battle between the Trump administration and Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], which escalated in 2018.
British government officials met Canyon Bridge during the 2017 takeover talks, and it pledged to invest in Imagination s research and development capabilities in Britain when the deal was approved in November of that year.
Imagination s former chief executive, Hossein Yossaie, has warned the government that China Reform was trying to seize control of the company using the coronavirus crisis as cover, Sky News said on Tuesday. 
Yossaie could not immediately be contacted for comment.
Imagination, which has 550 staff in the United Kingdom, said on April 10 chief executive Black would be replaced by Ray Bingham, executive chairman and partner at Canyon Bridge.

""Since acquiring Imagination Technologies in 2017, we ve made great progress in transforming the company and we remain fully committed to the UK and to supporting our customers around the world,"" Bingham said in an April 10 statement. "

BERLIN (Reuters) - An Apple collaboration with Google will make it quicker to get systems for tracing coronavirus infections up and running, the prime mover behind a European effort to support the smartphone technology says.
Technologists are racing to use Bluetooth short-range communications between devices as a proxy for measuring the risk that a person infected with the coronavirus can pass it on.

""We need to worry less about operating system stability and device calibration,"" Boos, the founder of German business process automation startup Arago, said in written answers to Reuters.
PEPP-PT plans a progress update on Friday.
CHAIN OF INFECTION
The coronavirus can be spread by people who show no symptoms, increasing the urgency of efforts once an individual tests positive to break the chain of infection.
Digital technology can help give people targeted warnings to see their doctors or self-isolate, its backers say, reducing the need for lockdowns that have caused huge economic disruption.
Bluetooth advocates say it would be a more accurate and less intrusive way of logging the closeness and duration of personal contacts than location tracking based on networks or satellites.
But a divide has opened up between supporters of decentralized systems - including Apple and Google - and advocates of a centralised approach in which sensitive data is held on a server. The latter includes some governments, raising concerns that they could put citizens under surveillance.
PEPP-PT, being developed in partnership with Germany s Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute and technologists from other European countries, would support both models.
""A centralized model offers such much better pandemic management potential without infringing privacy,"" Boos said.
""But it should be a country s choice. You can gather the same data on top of a decentralized model - it just means more people have to move data on infected people.""
PEPP-PT is undergoing certification by Germany s cybersecurity watchdog and has drawn support from some leaders in Chancellor Angela Merkel s government. 

No decision has yet been made, however, to endorse an official contact-tracing app to run on PEPP-PT that experts say https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/09/science.abb6936 would need to be downloaded by at least 60% of the population to help achieve so-called digital herd immunity."

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc s  quarterly profit nearly halved, as it set aside more money to cover for corporate loans expected to go bust in the coming months and booked heavy losses on its debt and equity investments.
The Wall Street trading powerhouse on Wednesday also warned that it expects reduced revenue in its asset and wealth management businesses and a higher rate of client defaults in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.
While total net revenue was flat at $8.74 billion, three out of the bank s four business lines reported higher numbers. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $7.92 billion.
""Our quarterly profitability was inevitably affected by the economic dislocation,"" said Chief Executive Officer David Solomon. ""As public policy measures to stem the pandemic take root, I am firmly convinced that our firm will emerge well-positioned.""
Under Solomon, Goldman has been attempting to reduce its reliance on its flagship trading business and build out its consumer bank, although trading made a comeback in the quarter on that back wild swings in financial markets and accounted for nearly 60% of overall revenue.
Even as Goldman, under Solomon, has been trying to rework its business for the long term, this unusual period proved to be a lucky one for a bank without a major consumer lending arm.
""GS has less NII & credit risk than the big banks and it was good to see incremental profitability shine thru in the global markets and investment banking segments on the better volumes this quarter,"" Evercore ISI Glenn Schorr said in a note.
Solomon has made growing Goldman s consumer bank, Marcus, a top priority, and this quarter the division reported a $12-billion increase in deposits. He hopes to get Marcus deposits reach $125 billion in the next five years.
The bank s net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell to $1.12 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 from $2.18 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share tumbled to $3.11 from $5.71.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.35 per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.
On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co  said its profit plunged by more than two-thirds in the first quarter as the largest U.S. bank put aside nearly $7 billion in reserves to protect it from a wave of potential loan defaults in the months ahead.
 Wells Fargo   also reported dismal numbers due to loan loss provisions.

TRADING COMEBACK
The bank s bond trading business had its best quarter in nearly five years. Fixed income revenue surged 33%, while equities trading revenue jumped 22%.
The strong performance in trading, however, was offset by weakness in its asset management reporting line, where it booked losses of $868 million from lending and debt investments.
Provision for credit losses was $937 million for the first quarter, compared with $224 million a year earlier and $336 million in the fourth quarter.
Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the first quarter of 2020 were $184 million, compared with $37 million in the year-ago quarter.
Goldman also saw a 10% rise in operating expenses from a year earlier, primarily due to significantly higher expenses related to brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. 
In January, Solomon also set goals that the bank achieve a 13% return on equity (ROE), over 14% return on tangible equity (ROTE) and a 60% efficiency ratio within the next three years. 
The bank fell far short of those return targets this quarter, reporting an annualized ROE of 5.7% and ROTE of 6%.
Most brokerages tracking the investment bank had factored in a slump in macroeconomic conditions as the fallout of the coronavirus crisis whipsawed the broader economy, and expectations were muted on key financial metrics. 
Goldman s main rival  Morgan Stanley   will report quarterly results on Thursday.

Goldman s shares were down over 3% in premarket trade. "
588,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/automakers-will-need-months-to-get-factories-back-up-and-running-2140890,2020-04-15,Automakers Will Need Months to Get Factories Back Up and Running By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Automakers are anxious to get their assembly lines rolling again, especially since leaving factories idle is costing them billions of dollars by the week.
But the experience many of them have had in China illustrates just how long a slog it’s going to be before plants are producing at anywhere near pre-shutdown levels. It took almost two months for most of China’s industry to return to some semblance of normalcy -- and that was with the benefit of mobile apps the government installed on citizens’ cell phones to track their movements and potential exposure to Covid-19 infected people.
North American factories may have the benefit of Apple Inc . and Google  trying to start a similar contract-tracing effort, but participation will be voluntary. And the tensions brewing already between President Donald Trump and state governors indicate U.S. government efforts won’t be nearly as centralized as China’s was, suggesting that already cash-strapped suppliers may also have to deal with a patchwork of state-by-state orders dictating when businesses can reopen.
“Discipline is the key to success,” Jim Tobin, the president of Asia operations at auto-parts maker Magna International Inc., said last week. “In China, there’s mandates that come out. Here, there are requests.”
Magna and other companies implemented dozens of protocols -- including worker-temperature screenings and physical distance barriers -- to open factories on single shifts, Tobin said during a webinar hosted by the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many vehicle and parts plants in North America had been running multiple shifts to meet demand that’s held steady near all-time highs for years. Now, sales have cratered and are unlikely to recover quickly.
Tesla  Inc. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  both are planning to begin reopening U.S. plants on May 4 after idling them in mid-March. General Motors Co . and Ford Motor  Co. have refrained from scheduling restart dates for their facilities, while  Toyota  Motor Corp.  and  Honda  Motor Co   have said theirs will be down through at least May 1.
While setting dates to reopen sends a signal to suppliers to start getting their parts inventories ready, doing so won’t be simple, with new layers of precautions and complications that didn’t exist before shelter-in-place orders came into effect nearly a month ago.
Here’s a rundown of what the industry is grappling with as it prepares for a restart:
Patchwork of Orders
A typical vehicle has thousands of parts, and as automakers survey their supply chains, they now have to look not just at inventories, but at health orders across the country. What the virus curve looks like in Illinois compared with Michigan or Ohio could determine whether or not a vehicle will have all the components needed to resume production.
“What the manufacturers need to do is be able to map out state by state, county by county, where manufacturers are with regards to local lockdown stay-at-home orders,” said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group’s U.S. automotive practice.
Even in states where people are allowed back to work, auto companies will likely use staggered shifts to increase social distancing and allow for more frequent deep cleaning. They’ll also likely deal with high rates of absenteeism, especially among older workers who fear getting infected, Collie said.
Supply Chain
Suppliers typically need a week or two of advance work to support an automaker’s ability to start running their assembly lines again, said Anne Marie Uetz, a Detroit-based partner at the law firm Foley and Lardner LLP, which represents parts manufacturers. And there are at least two major impediments the supply chain will be dealing with: kids and cash.
With many school systems closed until the end of the year, parents within the workforce will have to find some form of child care before reporting back to plants. Many will be wary of bringing the virus home to their families.
The other problem is cash flow. With production already having been shut down for roughly a month, suppliers’ coffers are starting to run dry and many need help with the expenditures necessary to restart, Uetz said. Some are getting assistance from the federal government, but automakers also are negotiating ways to help.
The dire financial straits many suppliers are in doesn’t leave much room for error in deciding on when to resume output, Magna’s Tobin said.
“Start-stop does not help liquidity, because we start buying material, employing people, then they say, ‘We’re going to push it out another two weeks,’” Tobin said, referring to supplier-carmaker relationships.
PPE Needs
Much of the auto industry has pivoted to supporting the health-care industry by making ventilators, masks, face shields and medical gowns. Some of those efforts to make personal protection equipment -- or PPE -- will come in handy for their own workforce, which pushed back against keeping factories open last month.
Social distancing and barriers will be go-to tools, but for workers who can’t avoid close interaction, they’ll need face shields, said Aaron McCarthy, Magna’s chief of human resources. Companies may be unable to provide them until front-line health care workers have enough.
Ford is already tallying up the equipment needs for its workplaces, Jim Farley, the automaker’s chief operating officer, said in a podcast interview with Automotive News last week.
“We’re identifying all the PPE requirements, which is millions and millions and millions of equipment we’re going to need to bring people back,” Farley said. “We’re not going to bring anyone back or even think about it before we have the sufficient supplies.”

589,https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/apple-releases-budget-iphone-se-priced-at-399-as-coronavirus-stalls-economy-2141015,2020-04-15,Apple has a $399 iPhone SE for the budget-conscious as coronavirus stalls economy By Reuters,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Wednesday released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, cutting the starting price for the company s smartphone line in a move to broaden its appeal to budget-conscious customers as the coronavirus hobbles the global economy.
The lower-cost model could also attract more consumers to Apple services, a growing driver of revenue. Shares of Apple fell 0.8%, less than the 2.1% decline of the S&P 500 index.
Apple will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with delivery of devices expected to start April 24.
The iPhone SE will start at $50 less than what was previously the cheapest iPhone available, the iPhone 8, which will be retired. The SE comes with a 4.7-inch display and the same processor chip as Apple s most advanced phone, the 11 Pro. The SE lacks Apple s facial recognition system to unlock the device, instead relying on a fingerprint sensor similar to older models. While the new iPhone adds features such as wireless charging and a high-end camera, it lacks connectivity for 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks.
The announcement comes as the United States and much of the world is reeling from the novel coronavirus, although U.S. political leaders have begun to talk about ending stay-at-home orders and restarting the economy, hoping record deaths and falling hospitalizations represent a peak.
Previous iPhones have been unveiled in a polished presentation in front of fans, but large events remain banned in Apple s home base of Santa Clara County, California, where public officials ordered the first lockdowns in the United States to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Apple s cheaper phone reflects the coronavirus-driven economic downturn and job loss.
Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies, said that Apple likely realized many customers were buying older models such as the iPhone 8 rather than the newer iPhone 11 Pro at $999, ""and a big part of that is probably price."" Those budget-minded iPhone buyers may have been turned off by the iPhone 8 s aging chips and camera.
Apple is ""addressing that head-on with a device and price that can still get people on the latest technology,"" he said. ""Having a device you re sure is going to last a long time is exactly what (consumers) want.""
The new aluminum-and-glass SE - which comes in black, white and red, looks much like an iPhone 8.
The cheaper phone enters a cut-throat market for value phones, especially in China, where Apple derives about 17% of sales. In China, rivals such as  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) last month announced models with 5G features starting at about $425.
But Bajarin said buyers interested in 5G may gravitate toward flagship phones, while budget buyers “are not people that would give a hoot about 5G.”
With wavering hardware sales, Apple has been investing in subscription services such as its Apple TV+ streaming television service, Apple Music and iCloud. The new SE will come bundled with a one free year of the streaming television service, similar to Apple s flagship devices released last fall.
""Given its price tag, (the iPhone SE) is unlikely to be that impactful for Apple’s financials, but could help widen the installed base, which will be helpful long term for Apple’s services revenue,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst with Atlantic Equities.
Horace Dediu, an analyst with Asymco, said that budget-minded phone buyers may not pay attention to whether a device has Apple s latest chips, but third-party app developers do. If more iPhone users have powerful hardware, he said, it could encourage developers to create apps with augmented reality and artificial intelligence that could help the devices stand out against competitors.
The coronavirus has created a volatile start to the year. Sales in China, the first nation hit by the virus, plunged, then rebounded as the country began to reopen. Sales of 500,000 phones in February rose to 2.5 million phones in March, according to government sales data there.
Apple will begin selling the new model online while its stores around the world are closed, except those within its greater China sales region.
Apple gets about 31% of its sales from its elegant stores and website, with 69% coming from partners such as mobile carriers and other retailers.
Apple said partners would decide whether to sell the phones in their physical stores. Many of Apple s resellers are trying to guide customers toward online sales. Major partners such as  Best Buy  Inc  have reduced their hours, and AT&T Inc  has closed about 40% of its U.S. retail stores.

Best Buy said customers would be able to pre-order the new iPhone on its website and either have it shipped to their home or use the company s curbside pickup option.  Verizon Communications  Inc , which has stopped selling any phones in physical stores, told Reuters on Wednesday that it will not sell the iPhone SE in stores. T-Mobile US Inc  did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

""Apple and Google have a lot of work to do to convince a rightfully skeptical public that they are fully serious about the privacy and security of their contact tracing efforts,"" he said in a statement. 
A critical factor in re-opening economies shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic is the ability to identify who has come into contact with carriers so that public health officials can control a resurgence of the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus.
This contact tracing effort got a boost recently when Google and Apple said they were collaborating on technology to help identify people who have crossed paths with a contagious person and alert them.
""I urgently want to know how Apple and Google will assure that consumers’ privacy interests are strongly balanced with the legitimate needs of public health officials during the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Blumenthal, who has been outspoken about privacy issues raised by the powerful tech companies.
""A public health crisis cannot be a pretense to pave over our privacy laws or legitimize tech companies  intrusive data collection about American’s personal lives,"" he said.
Apple and Google had no comment on Blumenthal s remarks but pointed to a joint release which said that ""privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance.""
The companies said they started developing the technology in March to streamline technical differences between Apple s iPhones and Google s Android that had stymied the interoperation of some existing contact tracing apps.
The companies said that the technology - planned to be released in mid-May - would not track users  locations but their interactions, that the interactions would be anonymized and that nothing would be monetized.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, told Snapchat s ""Good Luck America"" that he had not spoken with Google or Apple but believed that the public would accept contact tracing apps more easily if they were not run by the federal government.
""I think they d feel better about it if it s private,"" he said.
Apple and Google have taken many positive steps to protect privacy, said Sara Collins, policy counsel at the advocacy group Public Knowledge.

""While this is a promising first step, there are other controls that will need to be put in place to make this truly privacy protective,"" she said, including limits on sharing data and deleting data once it is no longer needed."

Investing.com - Wall Street s first-quarter earnings season kicked off this week, with banks taking center stage, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to hammer the economy.
 
JPMorgan , Bank of America ,  Citigroup  ,  Wells Fargo   and Goldman Sachs  all reported alarming plunges in their respective Q1 profit. The nation’s largest banks also increased their loan-loss reserves by billions of dollars amid expectations for a jump in defaults from customers in the coming months.
 
Looking ahead, next week marks the first busy week of the first-quarter earnings season, with many of the big-name U.S. technology stocks, such as Netflix ,  IBM   and Intel  set to report.
 
The week after that then sees high-profile companies such as Apple , Microsoft , Facebook , Advanced Micro Devices , Tesla , Boeing ,  Caterpillar  , and McDonalds release their quarterly results.
 
We re bracing for one of the worst earnings seasons in recent history. Analysts expect Q1 S&P 500 earnings to have fallen 12.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as the pandemic brought much of the global economy to a screeching halt.
 
U.S. stocks have recovered from their March lows, boosted by a raft of U.S. monetary and fiscal stimulus.
 
The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions to support the economy during the coronavirus crisis in recent weeks.
 
There have been rate cuts and a slew of credit and lending programs that could inject more than $6 trillion into the economy.
 
Congress has passed $2 trillion in rescue efforts but continues to squabble over how much more should be allocated and how it should be distributed.
 
The S&P 500 is still down about 18% from its Feb. 19 record closing high, as the path to an economic re-start and the effectiveness of gigantic stimulus packages around the world remain unclear.
 
In the United States, the hardest-hit nation, the coronavirus death toll topped 30,000 on Wednesday and set a record single-day increase for the second day running.
 
President Donald Trump said he would announce guidelines for reopening the economy on Thursday, however, state governors - especially on the East Coast - seem to be pushing for a cautious approach.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc s  new iPhone SE for the budget-conscious is unlikely to be a major driver of sales in China, a Weibo survey suggested, with analysts noting its lacks of 5G capability.
In a poll conducted on social media site Weibo, 60% of roughly 350,000 respondents said they would not buy the new $399 model, the cheapest iPhone available.
But roughly a fifth said they would buy it, while the rest said they would consider a purchase. Though respondents were not asked for reasons for their choices in the poll, many commented that they would be interested if the price drops further.
""If you don t buy it and I don t buy it, tomorrow the price will drop another 200 yuan ($28),"" said one Weibo user whose comment got more than 10,000 likes.
Apple s market share in China - its third-biggest market, accounting for roughly 15% of its sales - has shrunk over the past several years as Chinese Android brands increasingly release higher-end phones. 
The reception for the iPhone SE was similarly muted in Europe, where almost 1 million people have caught the coronavirus and many countries have closed shops or ordered people to stay at home.
Despite the inauspicious backdrop, the new Apple device will offer owners of the ageing iPhone 6 an affordable way to get onto the latest and most secure version of Apple s iOS smartphone operating system, one industry analyst said.
""These are people who keep their phones for four or five years, until they either break or the battery dies,"" said Annette Zimmermann at consultancy Gartner.
5G RACE
Competition has intensified in China as rivals are now releasing 5G devices compatible with the country s upgraded telecoms networks while Apple has yet to launch an iPhone with 5G capability.
Last week several Chinese online retailers reduced iPhone 11 prices by as much as 17%. Apple occasionally lets its Chinese seller partners cut prices to spur demand, though it seldom allows pricing leeway for vendors overseas.
Three China-based analysts said the iPhone SE would mainly appeal to Apple brand loyalists who don t want to spend about $700 for the high-end iPhone 11.
""The new iPhone SE will, for sure, attract mid-range users who don t take 5G connectivity as a necessity,"" said Mo Jia, who tracks the global smartphone industry at research firm Canalys.
Tech investors will nevertheless be watching its reception in China to gauge how demand for consumer devices may rebound once the coronavirus pandemic subsides and whether iPhone sales in China can soften the blow of lost purchases elsewhere.
China is the only major market where Apple s stores have reopened as the spread of the virus prompts governments around the world to impose lockdowns and other social distancing measures.
Government data showed that Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to Chinese vendors in March, nearly a fifth higher than the same month a year earlier and a sharp jump from only 500,000 in February, when the virus outbreak was at its peak in China.

The company will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with deliveries expected from April 24."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apps to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus should not collect user location data, the European Commission said on Thursday, as Apple Inc  and Google weighed whether to work with virus apps that use location tracking.
The EU executive s recommendation came as part of a unified European approach for using technology to combat COVID-19 and after several EU countries rolled out a variety of apps, prompting criticism from data privacy activists.
Doctors want to be able to identify recent encounters of people diagnosed with the virus to quarantine those potentially infected contacts, and a major question is how to do so while respecting privacy rights. Apple and Alphabet  s Google have proposed one system and are considering how to work with other groups that have overlapping goals and methods.
To date, 28 countries around the world have launched contact tracing apps, including 11 European countries, while another 11 are developing apps based on GPS or Bluetooth data, according to an analysis by law firm Linklaters.
The European Commission said in a statement that app use should be voluntary and not involve any type of data that pinpoints people s location. 
""Location data is not necessary nor recommended for the purpose of contact tracing apps, as their goal is not to follow the movements of individuals or to enforce prescriptions,"" the Commission document said, citing security and privacy risks.
Privacy rights group American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that rather than tracking where a person has gone, apps should use Bluetooth signals exchanged between phones to track encounters.
Apple and Google last week said they would help public health authorities and others develop apps for such Bluetooth-based contact tracing. The two companies will have to grant permission to app developers and health authorities to access the technology.
While Apple and Google s contact tracing technology itself does not rely on location information, both Google and Apple generally allow app developers to collect location information with the user s permission.
The two companies told Reuters that they still are developing policies on whether to allow contact tracing apps using its new technology to also gather location data.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, told the news arm of  Snap Inc   in an interview this week that users likely would reject contact tracing apps that collect location data.
Apple and Google declined to comment on Fauci s remarks.
Americans in an early April Pew Research Center survey were sharply divided over government tracking of locations of people who test positive for the virus, with 52% saying it would be acceptable and 48% saying it would be unacceptable. 
About two-thirds of a country s population would need to be involved for contact tracing to be effective, a study by researchers at Oxford University s Big Data Institute said.
The European Commission further said mobile apps should be based on anonymized data and work with other apps in other EU countries.
It said public health authorities will assess the effectiveness of such apps by the end of the month, with EU countries expected to share the feedback in May and the EU executive to put out a progress report in June.
""Strong privacy safeguards are a prerequisite for the uptake of these apps, and therefore their usefulness,"" European digital chief Thierry Breton said in a statement.
Breton said he had held a video conference with Google chief Sundar Pichai and Youtube CEO Susan Wojcicki on Wednesday to discuss their cooperation with Apple to create contact tracing technology.

Google said it was a good meeting and that the joint effort with Apple was designed to be opt-in and to comply with privacy and security standards."

Companies in the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index are expected to release figures showing a 22% plunge in first quarter earnings, Refinitiv data show, after estimates at the start of the year had initially forecast a 10.5% rise.
Amid deepening uncertainty for the global economy, many European firms have scrapped their outlooks. The Refinitiv data based on analyst forecasts show earnings down 34.2% in the second quarter and 25.5% in the third.
""Fasten your seatbelt,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  . ""The final numbers will likely be worse as the global economy has come to a standstill, which might not be fully factored into consensus.""
Barclays and Citi expect a 40% to 50% slide in profits and dividends by the end of the year.
Yet, market moves suggest some risks have been put to one side. The STOXX 600 has bounced 22% from lows in mid-March, when the virus was spreading fast in Europe and lockdowns were being put in place, although the index is still down 26% this year.
""I suspect that after the bounce we had in the market in the past couple of weeks we could see a reality check with earnings forcing the market to focus more on fundamentals,"" Cau said.
As companies report dire first quarter figures, investors will scrutinise balance sheets and comments by executives on their plans for restructuring or for any temporary or permanent layoffs to see how well firms can cope with what some analysts say could be the deepest recession since World War II.
Investors will be asking whether cost cuts are realistic, looking for signs of life in April sales and checking the size of inventories, said Maximilian Anderl, head of Concentrated Alpha Equity at UBS Asset Management.
Headline numbers won t move share prices, he said, ""because I think investors like us just see through this and we don t go for goodwill, we go for free cash-flow generation.""
Investors would be watching for ""anything that gives you the feeling that the company is still growing slowly and we are going through this,"" he added.
It marks a dramatic reversal for corporate Europe, which had expected a recovery at the start of 2020 as the fog of uncertainty began lifting over Britain s departure from the European Union and a U.S.-Chinese trade dispute started to cool down.
But, instead of working to boost profits, most companies have scrapped existing plans and some are struggling to survive.
""The big question is whether investors will get outlooks from companies in order to navigate the equity market as expectations are important for valuation and thus future returns,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy, Saxo Bank.

LOSSES CLIMB
ASML , among the first few blue chips to report, said it could not issue a formal full-year outlook, and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) withdrew its outlook for 2020 after reporting an 81% drop in first-quarter operating profit.
Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  , Apple  component supplier STMicroelectronics , Sanofi  and Volvo (ST:VOLVb) are some of the major companies expected to report in the week starting April 20.
Cyclical sectors, such as airlines, restaurants, pub operators, cruise ship operators and other leisure firms, will be hit hardest as governments tell people to stay home.
Estimated global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, data from the International Air Transport Association showed. 
But airline stocks have steadied with the help of state aid. Shares in easyJet  climbed this week after the firm said it had enough cash reserves to survive a nine-month shutdown.
Others are still being hammered. Energy firms are grappling with oil prices (LCOc1) at less than half the level they were at the end of 2019, while carmakers are struggling to find buyers for their vehicles.
Financial stocks in the euro zone have underperformed other sectors on worries about a spike in bad loans.
U.S. banks kicked off the earnings season, with JPMorgan Chase & Co  and  Wells Fargo  & Co  reporting sharp drops in profits after setting aside billions of dollars to protect them from potential loan defaults.
Anderl at UBS said state stimulus packages had stabilised economies for now, but another wave of shutdowns in autumn, if the coronavirus outbreak accelerated again, remained a threat.
""That would mean this is dragging on further,"" he said.

599,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/take-five-euro-zone-earnings-economy-2143584,2020-04-17,"Take Five: Euro zone, earnings, economy By Reuters","(Reuters) - 1/TESTING TIMES
It s going to be a big week for the euro zone. Italy s bond yields are drifting higher, concerns are growing about its debt ratios and anti-euro sentiment is rising in bloc s third-biggest economy.
The European Central Bank calmed markets a month ago with a 750 billion-euro emergency bond-buying scheme. But politicians  failure to come through with coronabonds undid much of the benefit, meaning markets are again testing policymakers  resolve by pushing out the Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap.
A key gauge of Italian credit risk, that yield spread is back near levels seen before the ECB announcement. Essentially, the ECB will now have to work harder on capping Italian borrowing costs and preventing the spread from blowing out. It s probably already front-loading Italian bond buying, but markets have started watching for the ECB to announce another rise in debt purchases.
Could euro zone finance ministers ease the burden? They meet on April 23 to have another stab at pooling euro zone risk, but the chances of success are slim. A S&P ratings review the next day could see Italy downgraded to BBB-. Beyond that, a ""junk"" rating looms -- and even higher borrowing costs.

2/EUROPE INC: DO WE CARE?
Even the world s largest financial market regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions, doesn t care about first-quarter corporate earnings, so why should Europe?
Europe begins reporting results next week with the likes of  Credit Suisse  , Apple  component supplier STMicroelectronics , Sanofi  and Volvo (ST:VOLVb) all due to report and focus is on the second-half and 2021 outlook.
European companies are expected to report a 22% earnings decline in the first quarter and 34% drop in the second, Refinitiv data show. That would be the sharpest decline in annual profits since at least the global financial crisis.
With the STOXX index down 25% year-to-date, much of that s already priced in. Those seeking detailed commentary on where companies stand might be disappointed. So far, ASML and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have failed to provide outlooks. Given uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and lockdowns, more companies may follow suit.

3/US EARNINGS ALSO HEAT UP
If big banks were the appetiser for the U.S. corporate reporting season, investors are preparing to dig into the main course, with around 100 S&P 500 companies due to post first-quarter results in the coming week.
They include Netflix  and airlines such as Delta  and Southwest , after major carriers agreed in principle to a $25 billion U.S. rescue package.
Others include consumer giant Coca-Cola , chip stalwart Intel , defence company  Lockheed Martin   and wireless carrier Verizon .
Investors are bracing for brutal first-quarter earnings as well as for a big profit swoon in 2020 overall. But they will also look for signs of how soon business can get back on track, with Wall Street factoring in a profit rebound in 2021.

4/PMI PAIN
We ll soon get a glimpse of how economies fared in April as the full effects of coronavirus lockdowns appeared. And the advance readings of purchasing manager surveys (PMI) are likely to be harsh.
Composite euro zone PMIs, comprising services and manufacturing, plummeted last month to a record low of 29.7 versus February s 51.6 - the biggest monthly drop since the survey began in July 1998. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction. What s more, the difference between final composite PMIs between February and March was 21.876, four times the fall seen in November 2008, during the global financial crisis.
U.S. PMIs will also drop further in April, after record-low March readings showed the economy may be already in recession.
Flash PMIs may not drop that dramatically in April, but it won t be the end of the pain. Consumption may recover only gradually after lockdowns end and unemployment may rise further -- putting pressure on central banks to deliver more stimulus.

5/BELLWETHER RECKONING
South Korea, a trailblazer in the battle against COVID-19, on Thursday releases first-quarter economic growth data. That should provide some idea of how Asia s fourth-biggest economy has held up.
It has seemingly tamed the outbreak with rigorous testing rather than blanket lockdowns. New cases this week held under 50 daily, a level the authorities say is crucial to keep the coronavirus under control.
The first-quarter GDP numbers will offer a glimpse of what a model virus response looks like in economic terms and a reading on world trade during some of the darkest days. Forecasts vary between a slowdown to a contraction as severe as 2%.
Markets may find an ugly growth number in Asia s bellwether economy harder to shake off than China s 6.8% contraction, putting pressure on nascent confidence. Cash has poured into bonds and the benchmark Kospi (KS11) stock index has gained 33% since last month s trough - leading the region and second only to a 38% rally in Argentina.

Apple shares  fell 1.6% to $282.13 on Friday morning, bucking a 1.5% rise for the benchmark S&P 500.
The Goldman analysts also lowered their price target for the stock by 7% to $233 in its report forecasting the drop in iPhone demand for the quarter ending in June, Apple s fiscal third quarter. 
The brokerage noted that average selling prices for consumer devices are likely to decline during a recession and remain weak well beyond the point when units recover.
""We do not assume that this downturn results in Apple losing users from its installed base. We simply assume that existing users will keep devices longer and choose less expensive Apple options when they do buy a new device,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, which holds Apple shares, said he expects a significant drop in iPhone sales, but 36% seemed ""extreme.""
“I view some of that as deferred demand...I think some of that will come back in succeeding quarters,” Tuz said.
A Goldman ""sell"" rating is relatively rare. Of the stocks in the investment bank s global equity coverage universe, 15% have sell ratings, compared with 46% ""buy"" and 39% ""hold.""
Of the 40 analysts covering Apple shares, 30 have ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings, seven have ""hold"" ratings, and three have ""sell"", according to Refinitiv.
Earlier this week, Apple released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, lowering the starting price for the company s smartphone line to broaden its appeal among budget-conscious customers.
Goldman said it does not expect the company to launch the upcoming iPhone models until early November, as limited global travel could impede Apple s final engineering and production process.

Since the S&P 500 hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, Apple shares are down about 13% against a 16% decline for the overall index."
601,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-chinesebacked-owners-commit-to-uk-hq-for-imagination-tech--source-2143610,2020-04-17,Exclusive: Chinese-backed owners commit to British HQ for Imagination Tech By Reuters,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - The Chinese-backed owners of Imagination Technologies told the British government on Friday the chip designer would remain headquartered in the United Kingdom and they would consult over any board changes.
Confirming an earlier Reuters source-based report, private equity firm Canyon Bridge, which is backed by Chinese state-owned China Reform holdings, said it had a constructive meeting with the British government.
British lawmakers recently became concerned that Imagination Technologies, which supplies intellectual property in areas including graphics and video processing to groups like Apple , could end up being moved out of the United Kingdom. 
Canyon Bridge representatives had a conference call with Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden on Friday.
""Imagination Technologies and its owners Canyon Bridge had a constructive meeting,"" a spokesman for Canyon Bridge and Imagination Technologies said in an emailed statement.
""We discussed our ongoing commitment to Imagination Technologies as a UK-headquartered business and have agreed to maintain dialogue with the Secretary of State as we further build out our senior management team,"" the spokesman said.
A British government source also confirmed the meeting had taken place. 
""The government will continue to monitor the situation closely and take the appropriate steps as necessary to make sure it protects UK interests,"" the source said. 
Once a jewel in Britain s technological crown, Imagination was bought by Canyon Bridge in 2017.
British lawmakers became concerned that the company could end up being moved out of the United Kingdom when Canyon Bridge tried to appoint its board members, though the crucial board meeting earlier this month was cancelled at the request of the government.
A source with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity said Canyon committed to the majority of Imagination Technologies  staff remaining in the United Kingdom and to continue investment in research and development and intellectual property development.
""They want to maintain their commitment to the UK economy,"" said the source.
Spokesmen for the British government declined immediate comment.
British lawmaker David Davis told Reuters on Tuesday that the government should seek every mechanism to prevent the removal of the technology base of Imagination Technologies to China, including seeking a Western buyer for the company.
Davis said Imagination was a strategic asset and the government should make it absolutely plain that it does not view the export of such important British technology with equanimity.
The sale of Imagination Technologies, founded in 1985, was approved by the government of then-Prime Minister Theresa May on the basis that Canyon Bridge would be subject to U.S. law. 
Canyon Bridge was originally incorporated in the United States but has since moved to the Cayman Islands, a spokesman said.
The sale of Imagination in 2017 came after its biggest customer Apple said it would develop more of its own graphics technology, sending the British company s shares down 70%.
British government officials met Canyon Bridge during the 2017 takeover talks, and it pledged to invest in Imagination s research and development capabilities in Britain when the deal was approved in November of that year.

Apple continued to use Imagination s technology, and Imagination announced a new multi-year, multi-use license agreement with the iPhone maker in January."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With expectations higher than the skyscrapers of Manhattan, the WNBA s number-one overall draft pick Sabrina Ionescu is poised to transform the New York Liberty and ready to torch the competition with the national spotlight pointed on her.
Already dubbed ""Lady Liberty"" in the pages of the New York Post, the Big Apple  is ready to roll out the red carpet for the University of Oregon guard, who was the first NCAA player to score 2,000 career points, 1,000 rebounds and 1,000 assists. 
Now, she is ready to embrace the super-sized ""platform"" and ""voice"" that comes with the league s biggest media market.
""Obviously, it starts with basketball, hoping to get people to buy into the team and show up to games,"" said Ionescu. ""But just using our platform as a women s basketball player to do more than just that. 
""I m excited to stand for something more than just being a basketball player in that city.""
It is not yet clear when Ionescu s professional career will officially take off, with the WNBA season - originally scheduled to begin May 15 - on hold amid the coronavirus lockdown.
Regardless, she will find herself on a team in transition: Moving into Brooklyn s  Barclays   Center with new head coach Walt Hopkins and the arguable face of the franchise, Tina Charles, headed to Washington, D.C. in a trade with the Mystics.
New York Liberty claimed five of the first 15 picks in Friday s draft, with an eye toward revitalizing its roster after two back-to-back seasons of lackluster performance. 
""Being a part of a younger team and just trying to learn from them and seeing where I fit in, what role I m going to play, is exciting,"" said Ionescu, who sees similarities in the Liberty program and the one she came to know at Oregon.

""They have great guards there, with their ability to shoot and spread the floor out, but also run in transition,"" the 22-year-old said. ""Being able to enter an offense where it s been really similar to what I ve been playing with the last four years is exciting."" "
604,https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/trumps-coronavirus-reopening-plan-has-big-holes-health-experts-say-2143914,2020-04-18,"Trump's coronavirus reopening plan has big holes, health experts say By Reuters","By Ann Saphir
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. economy has imploded in the past month amid aggressive measures to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, with 22 million people filing for unemployment benefits and most factories, stores and other businesses at a virtual standstill.
The governors of Michigan, Florida and other states outlined tentative steps on Friday to reopen their economies, a day after the White House issued guidelines to help states decide when to lift lockdown orders and allow firms to restart and workers to return to their jobs.
President Donald Trump, a Republican who is running for re-election in November, touted the guidelines as a blueprint for a reawakening of the economy, saying growth would soar like a ""rocket ship"" after the restart. 
But the guidelines, and the ways in which experts say they fall short, suggest that revving activity back up to pre-pandemic levels will be anything but smooth or speedy.
States may be ready to end lockdowns once infections have declined for 14 straight days, availability of tests to detect the virus is stable or rising, and if there is enough hospital capacity to treat everyone who gets sick, the guidelines say. 
They also call on states to be ready to test all healthcare workers and anybody with symptoms, as well as to be able to trace contacts for people who test positive for the virus. 
How many states are ready for that? 
None, according to Harvard epidemiologist Bill Hanage, who was among the many experts who took to Twitter on Thursday to criticize the guidelines. Hanage says inadequate testing capacity is the main problem.
The United States has reported more coronavirus infections than any other country, with about 680,000 cases and more than 34,000 deaths. (To track infections by state, see here https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html.)
U.S. testing has been delayed https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-coronavirus-hospital-test and chaotic largely due to bureaucratic roadblocks and mistakes at the federal level. Trump, who initially downplayed the threat of the coronavirus outbreak to the country, has pledged to ramp up testing.
States are ""far from being able to do enough tests to enable us to move to the next phase of responding to the pandemic,"" says https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-policy-watch/what-testing-capacity-do-we-need Jen Kates of the Kaiser Family Foundation. She says there are no details in the guidelines on how much testing is needed. 
State governments also need more people to track new infections through phone calls and visits. Alphabet  s Google and Apple Inc  are working together on software to make contact tracing easier. The software is expected to be available https://www.reuters.com/article/ul-health-coronavirus-apple-alphabet/apple-google-to-create-contact-tracing-technology-to-fight-coronavirus-spread-idUSKCN21S1UF in mid-May.
""Not one of the 50 U.S. states currently has surveillance capabilities sufficient to enable case-based interventions at the necessary scale,"" Duke University researchers wrote in an extensive look https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/sites/default/files/atoms/files/covid-19_surveillance_roadmap_final.pdf at testing needs. 
The White House guidelines don t provide any information on how to get there. 
Charmaine Yoest of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank said the White House was right to leave decisions on reopening economies to state leaders. ""It has to be done based on the data that applies to their communities and their workforce,"" she said. 
But data on infections, and the means to deal with them, may be hard to come by. 
""There is no - zero, zip, zilch - way to upscale testing, PPE (personal protective equipment) production, hospital readiness, the public health workforce ... without robust federal leadership,"" tweeted Jeremy Konyndyk, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""States don t have the capacity or resources to achieve these things on their own.""
 FALSE START  FEARS 
The White House guidelines call for a staged reopening, which is consistent with recommendations from many experts. 
A study https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/how-to-restart-national-economies-during-the-coronavirus-crisis from McKinsey & Company, which is advising New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as he battles the nation s worst coronavirus outbreak, recommends opening a few sectors at a time, based on ""both the risk of transmission and the relative importance"" of each sector, as defined by number of jobs and contribution to the economy.
The guidelines also call for schools, factories, shops and restaurants to function differently than before the pandemic, again broadly consistent with a wide range of experts who say that maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, and frequent hand-washing and cleaning are critical to keeping the public safe. But those practices will slow commerce. 
As for reopening gyms and entertainment venues, which the White House plan suggests is possible in ""Phase 1"" of a restart, former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottleib urged caution.
""Those may not be permitted until we have seen that work can safely return without a resurgence,"" tweeted Gottleib, who was FDA commissioner from 2017 to 2019 and was otherwise generally supportive of the guidelines.
Assuming the country weathers the first stage of a restart without a resurgence of coronavirus, it is not clear, based on the guidelines, how quickly states could move to the next phases - that is key to gauging how quickly the economy can rebound. 
If each of the three phases in the guidelines lasts just two weeks, that s ""too fast,"" tweeted Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. 
It also may not be smooth. Economists warn that a ""false start"" - where the economy reopens, infections surge, and the economy needs to shut down again - could prolong the downturn. 

But governors of some states, including California and Idaho, say that s exactly what they d do. And that would likely further slow economic recovery."

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Caution recaptured world markets on Monday as another drubbing for U.S. crude oil futures kicked off a week of data and earnings that will drive home the damage being inflicted by global coronavirus lockdowns.
European stocks made a choppy start, with the pan-regional EUROSTOXX 600 (STOXX) swinging in and out of positive territory in early trading. London s FTSE (FTSE) and Germany s DAX (GDAXI) were up 0.2%.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) slipped nearly 0.5% too, after Wall Street enjoyed a strong end to last week, though it barely seemed to reflect the latest violent turbulence in oil markets.
With some global storage facilities nearly full to capacity, the  front-month  May benchmark U.S. crude contract (CLc1) was down $3.40, or 18%, to $14.87 a barrel, having at one point dived as low as $14.47 a barrel - the lowest since March 1999.
European benchmark Brent was down a more manageable 3% (LCOc1) at $27.30 a barrel, but it all points to the same problem - too much supply, not enough demand.
""For oil there is a bit of a technical story (with storage), but still, if energy consumption is down 30% and OPEC reduces supply by 10%, there is still a large gap,"" said Rabobank s head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot. 
The equity and other major markets however were still trading largely on the newsflow of the European virus numbers gradually coming down, he added.
MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) eased 0.2% in slow trade, pausing after five straight weeks of gains.
Japan s Nikkei (N225) fell 1.2%, but Chinese shares (SSEC) edged up 0.4% as a benchmark lending rate was lowered to shore up the coronavirus-hit economy after it contracted for the first time in decades.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Republicans were ""close"" to getting a deal with Democrats on a support package for small business.
The United States has by far the world s largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 750,000 infections and over 40,500 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has still rallied 30% from its March low, thanks in part to the extreme easing steps taken by the Federal Reserve. The Fed has bought nearly $1.3 trillion of Treasuries alone, and many billions of non-sovereign debt it would historically have never gone near.
""The question is, are markets underestimating this in terms of the long-term impact on the economy. There will be damage and there will be damage in terms of the consumer psyche,"" Rabobank s de Groot said. 
That damage should become all more clear this week with April global purchasing manager data - seen as some of the most forward-looking economic gauges - being published on Thursday.
A taster on Monday was that Japan reported its exports down almost 12% in March from a year earlier, with shipments to the United States down over 16%.
TESTING TIMES
In the currency markets, the dollar gained broadly as the concerns about global growth boosted the safe-haven appeal of the greenback and weighed on risk-oriented currencies such as the Australian dollar.
Against a basket of its rivals (=USD), the U.S. currency rose 0.2% to 99.90 and edged closer towards a three-year high of near 103 hit last month.
It gained about 0.1% on the euro and British pound and 0.2% on the Japanese yen. It last bought 107.80 yen  and traded at $1.2478 per pound GBP= and $1.0870 per euro (EUR=EBS).
The dollar s gains were despite the latest trader positioning data showing investors have been ramping up their short positions or bets against the greenback.
Bond markets also suggested investors expected tough economic times ahead, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) steady at 0.63%, from 1.91% at the start of the year.
""We are dealing with scales of declining economic activity that nobody has seen before. The potential hit to GDP in the second quarter this year will probably far exceed what we saw at the worst point of the financial crisis,"" Capital Group s economist Robert Lind said in a note. 
Italy s borrowing costs rose meanwhile, heading back towards last week s one-month highs, reflecting unease before a European Union summit later this week over how to tackle the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. 
Selling pressure on Italian government bonds has returned in the past week, undoing some of the benefits of the European Central Bank s massive bond-buying scheme, after euro zone politicians failed to agree to common debt issuance as a means of addressing the crisis.
Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte used an interview with Germany s Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday to repeat calls for the EU to issue common euro zone bonds to demonstrate the bloc s solidarity in the face of the pandemic.

""Thursday is the key day this week with the EU leaders summit a potentially big event for the future of Europe as they discuss how close the region can get to joint issuance in the near future,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid."

BERLIN (Reuters) - A rift has opened up over the design of smartphone apps to trace people in Europe at risk of coronavirus infection, potentially hindering efforts to curb the pandemic and ease crippling travel restrictions.
Scientists and researchers from more than 25 countries published an open letter on Monday urging governments not to abuse such technology to spy on their people and warning of risks in an approach championed by Germany.
""We are concerned that some  solutions  to the crisis may, via mission creep, result in systems which would allow unprecedented surveillance of society at large,"" said the letter that gathered more than 300 signatures.
Tech experts are rushing to develop digital methods to fight COVID-19, a flu-like disease caused by the novel coronavirus that has infected 2.4 million people worldwide and been linked to 165,000 deaths.
Automating the assessment of who is at risk and telling them to see a doctor, get tested or self-isolate, is seen by advocates as a way to speed up a task that typically entails phone calls and house calls.
Contact tracing apps are already in use in Asia, but copying their approach by using location data to would violate Europe s privacy laws. Instead, Bluetooth chatter between devices is seen as a better way to measure person-to-person contacts.
The apps should be voluntary, and would need to be downloaded by at least 60% of the population to achieve the so-called ""digital herd immunity"" needed to suppress COVID-19, say researchers from Oxford University s Big Data Institute.
Yet controversy over the best way forward could delay the rollout of apps to help governments, once they have brought the pandemic under control, to contain any new outbreaks.
MISSION CREEP 
The rift has opened up over a German-led initiative, called Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT https://www.pepp-pt.org), which has been criticised for being too centralised and thus prone to governmental mission creep.
Its critics back a decentralised contact tracing protocol called DP-3T https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/DP3T%20White%20Paper.pdf, pioneered by Swiss researchers, that is aligned with a technology alliance between Apple  and Alphabet  s Google.
The details are highly technical, but revolve around whether sensitive data would be kept safely on devices or stored on a central server in a way that might allow a bad actor to reconstruct a person s ""social graph"" - a record of where and when they meet other people.
""Solutions which allow reconstructing invasive information about the population should be rejected without further discussion,"" the scientists said in their letter.
Among the signatories was Michael Backes, head of Germany s CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, which pulled out of PEPP-PT at the weekend. Swiss researchers have also publicly dissociated themselves from PEPP-PT, citing concerns over centralisation and privacy.
Critics have also questioned PEPP-PT s assertion that seven European countries - Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland - had come on board. Spain and Switzerland now back rival DP-3T, government and research sources said. 
PEPP-PT said it was committed to guaranteeing the privacy of users and data protection at all times.
PEPP-PT also asserted its commitment to privacy in a 25-page document https://github.com/pepp-pt/pepp-pt-documentation/blob/master/10-data-protection/PEPP-PT-data-protection-information-security-architecture-Germany.pdf it released at the end of last week on GitHub, a software developers platform.
""If the system would leak information about personal behaviour, identities, or even reveal who has been infected with Sars-CoV-19, users would quite rightfully refuse to adopt the system,"" the document stated.
Germany plans to release a contact tracing app within weeks based on the PEPP-PT platform, government sources said last week. The head of France s INRIA digital research institute has also backed the initiative.
The PEPP-PT platform is designed to support national apps that could ""talk"" to each other across borders - a goal that could become harder to achieve if other European countries back a different standard.

""The debate is turning away the focus from what really matters: to build an app that traces the virus, not the human, and to do this as fast as possible,"" said Julian Teicke, CEO of Berlin insurance tech firm WeFox who is involved in a German-based coronavirus app tracing project called Healthy Together."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Tuesday said it would expand its App Store, Apple Music and other services to dozens of new markets in Africa, the Middle East and beyond in the biggest geographical expansion of its services in almost a decade.
Apple said it would expand the App Store to 20 countries, eight of them in Africa, and will offer its streaming Apple Music service in 52 additional countries and regions. The expansion is the largest since Apple grew what was then called the iTunes Store to India, Russia and more than 50 other countries in 2012.
Apple has focused on growing sales from its services segment, which totaled 17.8% of its $260.1 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year, as consumers have slowed in upgrading their smart phones. Apple executives said in January that the company had an installed base of 1.5 billion active devices and aimed to reach 600 million subscribers to either its own or third-party services by the end of this year.
Apple s biggest services revenue generator is the App Store, where it keeps a cut of between 15% and 30% of sales. In Africa, the store will expand to Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Libya, Morocco, Rwanda and Zambia. It will also become available in the Maldives and Myanmar in the Asia-Pacific region, Afghanistan and Iraq in the Middle East, and several nations in the Balkans and Oceania, for a total of 175 countries.
The company is also expanding its Apple Music service, bringing the total to 167 markets. Apple s top streaming rival,  Spotify Technology  SA , operates in 79 countries.

Apple will have different terms and pricing for streaming music in the new markets. In the United States, Apple offers a three-month free trial and charges individual users $9.99 a month thereafter. In the new markets, Apple will offer a six-month trial period and adjust monthly prices Ivory Coast and Myanmar, and $4.99 in markets such as Iraq and Kuwait."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are once again crowding into a narrow range of technology and internet stocks, heightening concerns that the market s dramatic bounce from last month s lows is becoming increasingly vulnerable to sharp reversals as the coronavirus outbreak continues to batter the economy. 
Just five stocks - Microsoft , Apple , Amazon , Google parent Alphabet  and Facebook  - account for more than 20% of the market cap of the entire S&P 500 index, according to BofA Global Research. That s a greater concentration in the top stocks than was seen during the dotcom bubble of 2000, analysts at the bank wrote.
The information technology sector carried a 25.4% weighting in the S&P 500 as of Friday, far more than the other 10 major sectors and slightly more than its weighting on Feb. 19, when the benchmark index hit its all-time high.
Strong balance sheets and business models that appear likely to weather the fallout from the outbreak have made these companies appealing destinations during the severe volatility of the past several months.
But a top-heavy market is also a worrisome sign to some investors - especially as concerns grow that the S&P s 26% rally from its March lows have put it far ahead of economic fundamentals at a time when the United States continues to shed jobs at a record pace and corporate earnings are deteriorating.
The index s narrow leadership may also be an indication that investors are skeptical that other areas of the market will fare well in coming months. At the same time, a turn lower in stocks could cause investors to bail out of winning shares to lock in their gains, leading to even steeper declines.
""If the market decides it is going to roll back over again and head back down to retest those lows, then people are going to take profits where the profits are greatest,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  .
Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix  have been the greatest contributors to the S&P 500 s total shareholder return so far this year, as of Friday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Netflix shares have climbed 35% so far in 2020, Amazon has risen nearly 30%, while Microsoft is up 11%.
Graphic - Tech, Internet stocks take charge: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/qmyvmllbpra/eikon.png
Meanwhile, an analysis by research firm Bernstein showed technology and internet names among the market s most widely owned stocks. The market s five most crowded stocks are Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Visa  and UnitedHealth , according to Bernstein s analysis, which uses factors such as institutional ownership and price momentum.
""You have a market that was narrow back in February and too concentrated in technology. Now it s even more so,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.
""There s a reason why this happens when the market is vulnerable, because people don t see a lot of value in the overall market, so they go into the small number of names they do see a lot of value in,"" Maley said.
Investors are watching for signs of equity weakness as other markets, such as oil which saw prices turn negative on Monday, are showing stress. Short bets against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust rose last week to their highest level in data dating back to January 2016, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
The appeal of tech and other internet companies makes sense to some investors, especially with an uncertain market and economic outlook.
""For a lot of folks, any growth is still going to be in the tech space, so it continues to argue for putting money into those stocks because growth is going to be at a premium,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
And while tech has outperformed the overall market, stocks in some other areas also have held up well, especially in healthcare and consumer staples, two traditionally defensive sectors.

""Technology has never been considered a  defensive  sector, but maybe it should be considering how well it has performed during a global pandemic,"" Bespoke Investment Group said in a report."

SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - When Singapore launched the first smartphone app of its kind last month to identify and alert people who had interacted with carriers of the novel coronavirus, the city-state of roughly 5.7 million people had 385 cases of infections.
But even as cases in the country - which is in lockdown - have surged past 9,000, only about one in five people have downloaded the app, TraceTogether, which uses Bluetooth signals to log when people have been close to one another.
The modest numbers in a tech-savvy country where trust in government is high shows the challenges facing public health authorities and technology experts around the world who are looking to exit lockdowns and believe contact-tracing apps can play an important role in restarting economies.
A few countries, including South Korea and Israel, are using high-tech methods of contact tracing that involve tracking peoples  location via phone networks. But such centralized, surveillance-based approaches are viewed as invasive and unacceptable in many countries for privacy reasons. 
The Bluetooth approach, being pursued at various stages by governments across Europe and Latin America, as well as in Australia and many Asia nations, requires a majority of people in a geographic area to adopt it for it to be effective.
An app in India, believed to be the second in the world to go live after Singapore, has reached 50 million downloads on Android phones, which dominate the market. That s a small fraction of the 500 million-strong smartphone user base, not to mention the population of over 1.3 billion.
""It requires quite a bit of effort on your side as a user and the value is not very tangible,"" said Frederic Giron, a Singapore-based analyst with market research firm Forrester, referring to TraceTogether. 
Singapore s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced new anti-virus efforts on Tuesday and said ""we will need everyone s cooperation to install and use"" apps such as TraceTogether, though he stopped short of saying it would be mandatory. 
The efforts in Singapore, India and elsewhere are still in their early stages. A joint initiative announced last week by Apple  and Google  could give the concept a boost, in part by smoothing key technical issues.
The apps also have limited utility during lockdowns, but could prove much more appealing when people are again in frequent contact. Italian carmaker Ferrari , for example, is rolling out a voluntary contact-tracing app as part of its programme for safely re-opening its factories.
In Australia, the government has suggested such apps could be mandatory, though that approach is fiercely opposed by European governments and privacy advocates. Apple and Google say they will not support compulsory tracing apps.
TRUST DEFICIT
The Bluetooth-based apps are designed to be more privacy-friendly than tracking techniques that use GPS or cellphone data. They use Bluetooth to broadcast and receive an encrypted, pseudonymous signal from nearby phones and create a log of interactions that remain on the phone, so users  names and numbers are not disclosed.
If a person tests positive for COVID-19, people who were near that person for a certain period of time can be alerted via their phones. The India app also has other functions and uses GPS data to identify infection clusters.
Some people in Singapore and India say they are willing to use such an app, even at some cost to their privacy.
""Right now, I don t care about privacy, at least amid this crisis,"" said Bengaluru-based Ganga Bopaiah, who works for an IT services company and already uses the Indian app, known as Aarogya Setu, which means ""health bridge.""
""As long as COVID-19 is around I d use it. In fact, I will use it more after the lockdown eases.""
Still, privacy is a contentious topic in India, especially in light of recent tensions between the government and the country s minority Muslim population.
""There is always an element of doubt when the government is asking you to divulge personal information,"" said Harish Iyer, an Indian LGBT rights activist who has not downloaded the app.
Self-quarantine orders in India s slums have also fanned mistrust among some Muslims who believe health workers are gathering data under the guise of containing the pandemic.
BACKGROUND GRIPES
The Indian government has been heavily backing the Aarogya Setu app, sending emails to companies including Facebook  and Google requesting them to promote the app, an official at Indian s IT ministry said. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also recommended people download it.
Singapore has not pushed Trace Together as heavily to date, though the prime minister s comments on Tuesday suggest that is changing. 
A big complaint about TraceTogether is that it doesn t work in the ""background"" on an iPhone, meaning the app has to be open at all times, which drains power and can interfere with other processes. Apple does not permit iPhone apps running in the background to access Bluetooth, for security reasons.
The new tools Apple has promised as part of its joint effort with Google will solve that problem, but only for apps that adhere to other requirements such as forgoing any use of location data and not being mandatory.
The TraceTogether developers this week welcomed the Google/ Apple efforts and said they would work with the companies  upcoming technologies to improve the app.

Desmond Fu, an iPhone user in Singapore, said he would definitely use the app as long as the background problem was resolved."

Investing.com – The Dow plunged on Tuesday, as a slump in oil triggered a sea of red across Wall Street, prompting investors to pull their bearish bet on large-cap tech stocks.
The Dow fell 2.52%, or 596 points, theS&P 500 slipped 2.83% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.92%.
Worries over a storage squeeze amid a collapsed in fuel demand sent oil prices sharply lower for the second day in a row, pressuring energy stocks.

Facebook , Amazon.com  and Apple  were down about 3%, while Netflix  was flat.
Also weighing on tech,  IBM   fell 4% after the company pulled guidance and reported quarterly revenue that missed expectations due to the impact from the coronavirus pandemic.
But some Covid-19 hotspots worldwide, including Italy and New York, offered a glimmer of hope amid encouraging data showing the lockdown measures continued to flatten the curve of infection.
Italy reported a record 2,723 recoveries, while New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reported 481 deaths in New York state overnight, but total hospitalizations were ""basically flat"" and the number of intubations declined.
Cuomo is set to meet President Donald Trump to discuss testing issues and the role of the federal and state governments in the screenings for the coronavirus, at a time when some states are set to reopen for business as early as this week."

Despite the plunge in oil prices of more than 40%, energy stocks outperformed the broader market, ending the day down 1.4%.
The selloff in oil stoked worries about loan defaults, pressuring regional banks, which typically carry a larger energy-lending portfolio than that of Wall Street banks.  
The Settle KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index fell more than 2.5%.
Tech stocks led the day of selling on Wall Street with FANG and chip stocks bearing the brunt.
Facebook  fell 4.2%, Amazon.com  fell 1.6% and Apple  was down 3.08%, while Netflix  ended down about 0.77%.

On the economic data front, the decline in existing home sales in March was not as bad as many had feared, but the data was largely shrugged off as it did not reflect the full extent of the lockdown measures, which began in mid-March.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners LP has built a stake of over $1.1 billion in Nintendo (T:7974), according to a letter seen by Reuters, a bet that digital software distribution and the development of new entertainment products will fuel growth at the Japanese consumer electronics company.
ValueAct, which first began buying the stock in April 2019, grew the position during the stock market sell-off in February and March, according to the letter sent to its investors.
Nintendo s future is bright, ValueAct wrote in its letter, adding there is potential for growth both in the software business and room for the company to transform itself into a broader entertainment company.
Nintendo is known for its gaming consoles that often compete with Sony Corp (T:6758) s and Microsoft  s products.
Nintendo s shares, traded in the United States, rose 5.7% to change hands at $55.90. The company was not immediately available for comment. 
San Francisco-based ValueAct said it has had several meetings with members of Nintendo management and that it believes in the vision the company s chief executive, Shuntaro Furukawa, has shared with ValueAct and with others.
Unlike other investment firms that push for change publicly and often ask for board seats at target companies, ValueAct does not mention that it asked for representation.
But its partners could offer relevant guidance and experience to help Nintendo after having served on boards at Adobe  and Microsoft, the firm s letter said.
U.S. activist investors are increasingly looking abroad to target Japan s cash rich companies and this marks the third investment ValueAct has made in Japan in the last four years.
Only a few weeks ago ValueAct took a 7% stake in chip and display materials maker JSR Corp (T:4185) and last year ValueAct partner Rob Hale joined the board of Olympus, marking a milestone in corporate governance.
ValueAct said Nintendo has not prospered as much as video game software companies like EA and Activision as the industry s fortunes improved over the last decade. But it said the company was now going through a digital transition that was sure to pay off.
Additionally ValueAct said the company has a chance to become an entertainment company. ""We believe Nintendo will be one of the largest digital media services in the world, in a category with the likes of Netflix , Disney+, Tencent Interactive Entertainment and Apple  Music,"" the letter said.
ValueAct is known for working behind the scenes with management and not making noisy demands in public.
Two years ago, the firm announced an investment in  Citigroup   that was valued at $1.2 billion in another letter to its own investors. While there is much communication between the bank and the hedge fund at the highest levels, ValueAct does not have a board seat.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shielded by the resilience of three behemoth defensive stocks, the Swiss blue-chip index has comfortably weathered the coronavirus storm compared with other European benchmarks which have sustained up to three times more damage.
With no direct exposure to oil, airlines or other sectors battered by the pandemic, the Swiss Market Index (SSMI) is down less than 10% since the beginning of the year. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index has slumped 21% in the same period.
Switzerland is home to the world s biggest food group Nestle  and pharmaceutical giants Roche  and  Novartis  , all of whose earnings typically hold up even when markets are in turmoil and economic indicators turning south.
Graphic - European stocks by countries: Switzerland outperforms: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/oakpekwxprd/Pasted%20image%201587504345436.png
Nestle, Roche and Novartis make up over 70% of the blue-chip index, which has a market capitalisation of 1.16 trillion Swiss francs ($1.2 trillion). The trio are the biggest companies by market value in Europe.
Nestle, known globally for its packaged products like Maggi soups, KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe instant coffee, has been a top pick for investors while restrictions to contain the virus are forcing people around the world to stay at home.
""Markets that are more heavily weighted in defensives in general and pharmaceuticals in particular (Switzerland notably) tend to outperform, while countries heavily weighted in banks and oil and gas tend to lag (typically Italy, France or Norway),"" Makor Capital Markets strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre said.
Healthcare and foods have clearly found favour with investors since mid-February, when the virus broke out in Europe, leading to much smaller losses than for banks, car makers or travel and leisure stocks.
Within those sectors, Swiss names have been the top picks.

Analysts warn, however, that the heavy weighting of a handful of stocks in major indexes can give investors a false sense of security.
For example, never before has the overall weight of the top five S&P 500 (SPX) stocks been as high as now, with Facebook , Amazon , Apple , Alphabet  and Microsoft  (FAAAM) making up 22% of the index with 500 constituents.
A rise in just a few stocks can therefore lift a index even if many of its constituents are actually losing ground.

MOUNTAIN PASS, Calif. (Reuters) - The United States wants to curb its reliance on China for specialized minerals used to make weapons and high-tech equipment, but it faces a Catch-22.
It only has one rare earths mine - and government scientists have been told not to work with it because of its Chinese ties.
The mine is southern California s Mountain Pass, home to the world s eighth-largest reserves of the rare earths used in missiles, fighter jets, night-vision goggles and other devices.
But the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has told government scientists not to collaborate with the mine s owner, MP Materials, the DOE s Critical Materials Institute told Reuters.
This is because MP Materials is almost a tenth-owned by a Chinese investor and relies heavily on Chinese sales and technical know-how, according to the company.
""Clearly, the MP Materials ownership structure is an issue,"" said Tom Lograsso, interim director of the institute, the focal point of the U.S. government s rare earths research and a facility that typically works closely with private industry.
""We re going to allow the people in Washington to figure this out.""
The DOE instruction, which has not been previously reported, illustrates the competing pressures facing officials looking to resurrect the U.S. commercial rare earths industry, which has all but disappeared since its genesis in World War Two s Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. Lograsso did not say how the guidance was delivered to the institute.
Reviving domestic rare earths production has become a priority in Washington as relations with China, which dominates global supplies, have become increasingly frayed and U.S. lawmakers warn of the dangers of relying on a competitor for critical defense components. 
Even as the DOE has blacklisted MP Materials, the company is a candidate to receive up to $40 million in funding from the Pentagon, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
The Pentagon has yet to announce its decision on funding, which could go to more than one project, after delaying the decision from March due to the coronavirus crisis.
MP Materials is by far the most advanced player in the U.S. rare earths industry, given no rival project has even broken ground. As such, Mountain Pass is widely seen by industry analysts as the front-runner for Pentagon funding. 
The DOE did not respond to requests for comment on the instruction to scientists or any potential conflict with Pentagon policy.
The Pentagon is working closely with ""the president, Congress, allies, partners and the industrial base to mitigate U.S. reliance on China for rare earth minerals,"" said spokesman Lt Col Mike Andrews. The department did not respond to requests for comment on whether it might fund Mountain Pass or potential conflicts with DOE policy.
APPLE TO LOCKHEED
MP Materials, which bought the mine in 2017, describes itself as an American-controlled company with a predominantly U.S. workforce. The privately held firm is 9.9%-owned by China s Shenghe Resources Holding Co (SS:600392), though, and Chinese customers account for all its annual revenue of about $100 million.
""Had we not had a Chinese technical partner helping us do this relaunch, there s no way this could have been done,"" said James Litinsky, chief executive of JHL Capital Group LLC, a Chicago-based hedge fund and MP Materials  majority owner.
Litinsky declined to comment on the Pentagon funding. 
Asked for comment on the DOE instruction to scientists, Litinsky said: ""MP is on a mission to restore the full rare earth supply chain to the United States of America, whether the government helps us or not."" 
Shenghe did not respond to requests for comment.
MP Materials is among a slew of U.S. companies dependent on China s rare earths industry. Apple Inc  uses Chinese rare earths in its iPhone s taptic engine, which makes the phone vibrate.  Lockheed Martin  Corp  uses them to make the F-35 Lightning fighter jet. General Dynamics Corp  uses them to build the Virginia-class submarine.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further driven home the global nature of supply chains and how heavily Western countries rely on manufacturing powerhouse China for a host of key products, including drug ingredients. 
MANHATTAN PROJECT
Mountain Pass first opened in the late 1940s to extract europium, a rare earth used to produce the color red in televisions. It drew heavily on technology developed by Manhattan Project government scientists to separate the 17 rare earths, a complex and expensive process.
By the early 1980s, the mine was a top global rare earths producer. Its minerals were in much of the equipment that U.S. soldiers used during the first Gulf War in 1990.
However China ramped up development of a massive rare earths refining network and began boosting exports, undercutting other producers. ""The Middle East has oil. China has rare earths,"" then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said in 1992.
In 2010, China halted supplies to Japan during a diplomatic dispute, unnerving U.S. military officials who wondered if China could one day do the same to the United States. 
That refocused Washington s attention on the mine and its then-owner Molycorp, which launched a $400 million initial public offering the same year.
However, even as U.S. government scientists had begun research projects with Molycorp, the company went bankrupt in 2015 under the weight of its debt - partly built up to comply with tightened environmental regulations from the Obama administration - and cheaper Chinese competition. 
Two years later, Litinsky s group and Shenghe bought Mountain Pass out of bankruptcy. The processing equipment installed by Molycorp, however, remains unused because of poor design, Litinsky said.
For now, MP Materials ships more than 50,000 tonnes of concentrated rare earths per year to China for processing, the Achilles heel of the U.S. industry.
The company aims to restart its own processing by the end of 2020, Litinsky said. The goal is to produce about 5,000 tonnes per year of the two most common rare earth metals, more than enough for U.S. military needs.
Some rare earths analysts and academics have doubted whether Mountain Pass can resume processing so soon, citing concerns about its plans for waste disposal and water filtration.
 NATIONAL SECURITY MALPRACTICE 
Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Reuters that the United States  reliance on China for defense components could pose a strategic military threat. 
""It would be national security malpractice not to address this,"" said Rubio, who sits on the Senate s Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees.
This was echoed by Representative Chrissy Houlahan, a Pennsylvania Democrat, who said the issue of creating a viable domestic industry had been ignored for too many years.
""This isn t an issue we can just kick down the road,"" said Houlahan, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee.
The Pentagon asked miners in early 2019 to outline plans to develop rare earths projects and processing facilities, according to documents seen by Reuters. 
President Donald Trump sharpened the directive last July, telling the Pentagon to fund U.S. rare earths projects and find better ways to procure military-grade magnets made from rare earths.
On Wednesday, Australia-based  Lynas Corp   and privately held Blue  Line Corp   said they were chosen by the Pentagon to process in Texas so-called heavy rare earths, a less-common type of the specialized minerals, imported from Australia. The deadline for that project was in December.
MP Materials is said to have applied for the light rare earths funding, the deadline for which was March 2. No decision has been announced. Light rare earths are the most-commonly used of the specialized materials.
Other applicants for the Pentagon funding programs included Texas Mineral Resources Corp ; a joint venture between Alaska s UCore Rare Metals  and  Materion Corp  ; Medallion Resources Ltd  and  Search Minerals Inc  , both of Canada; and Nebraska s NioCorp Developments Ltd .

Meanwhile, U.S. government scientists at the DOE institute are studying ways to recycle rare earth magnets, to find substitutes and to locate new sources of the strategic minerals. None of that research is shared with MP Materials. 

""MP Materials recognizes they have become the elephant in the room that the U.S. government doesn t want to acknowledge, given their relationship with Shenghe,"" said Ryan Castilloux, a rare earths industry consultant at Adamas Intelligence."

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc  said on Wednesday it plans to raise about $1 billion in debt to beef up original content, a day after the streaming pioneer doubled its own projections for new customers as stuck-at-home users binged on movies and shows.
Shares of the company were down 3% at $420 in morning trade after it also forecast a weaker second half of the year when shelter-in-place orders are lifted.
Netflix plans to use some of the cash to acquire content and for possible acquisitions, positioning itself as major U.S. studios halt productions and delay film releases due to the coronavirus-led lockdowns.
Most programming for 2020, and much of 2021, has already been filmed and is being finished remotely in post-production, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on Tuesday, adding that the company was working on over 200 such projects.
As streaming video grows in the United States, the space has become more competitive with the debut of Walt  Disney  Co s  Disney+ and other upcoming rivals.
That threat has pushed Netflix, with about 183 million global subscribers, to aggressively expand its content and look overseas for growth.
""Despite new services on the horizon from HBO and launches of services from Disney and Apple , we expect minimal long-term impact to Netflix subscriber addition and retention,"" Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a client note. 
Netflix launched several popular original shows in the first quarter, including action film ""Spenser Confidential,"" documentary miniseries ""Tiger King,"" dating show ""Love is Blind"" and Spanish drama ""Money Heist."" 
The current quarter slate includes the Chris Hemsworth starred action movie ""Extraction,"" sitcom ""#blackAF,"" comedy show ""Space Force"" and reality dating series ""Too Hot to Handle.""
Netflix had a $15 billion cash budget for content last year and BMO Capital Markets had estimated spending on content to top $17 billion this year.
The company, which usually funds its spending spree by sporadically tapping the debt market, is selling senior notes this time. 

Netflix, which has about $15 billion in debt, last raised money in October 2019 through a $2 billion offering of senior notes."

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc  is planning to fix a flaw that a security firm said may have left more than half a billion iPhones vulnerable to hackers. 
The bug, which also exists on iPads, was discovered by ZecOps, a San Francisco-based mobile security forensics company, while it was investigating a sophisticated cyberattack against a client that took place in late 2019. Zuk Avraham, ZecOps  chief executive, said he found evidence the vulnerability was exploited in at least six cybersecurity break-ins. 
An Apple spokesman acknowledged that a vulnerability exists in Apple’s software for email on iPhones and iPads, known as the Mail app, and that the company had developed a fix, which will be rolled out in a forthcoming update on millions of devices it has sold globally. 
Apple declined to comment on Avraham’s research, which was published on Wednesday, that suggests the flaw could be triggered from afar and that it had already been exploited by hackers against high-profile users.
Avraham said he found evidence that a malicious program was taking advantage of the vulnerability in Apple’s iOS mobile operating system as far back as January 2018. He could not determine who the hackers were and Reuters was unable to independently verify his claim. 
To execute the hack, Avraham said victims would be sent an apparently blank email message through the Mail app forcing a crash and reset. The crash opened the door for hackers to steal other data on the device, such as photos and contact details. 
ZecOps claims the vulnerability allowed hackers to remotely steal data off iPhones even if they were running recent versions of iOS. By itself, the flaw could have given access to whatever the Mail app had access to, including confidential messages. 
Avraham, a former Israeli Defense Force security researcher, said he suspected that the hacking technique was part of a chain of malicious programs, the rest undiscovered, which could have given an attacker full remote access. Apple declined to comment on that prospect. 
ZecOps found the Mail app hacking technique was used against a client last year. Avraham described the targeted client as a “Fortune 500 North American technology company,” but declined to name it. They also found evidence of related attacks against employees of five other companies in Japan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. 
Avraham based most of his conclusions on data from “crash reports,” which are generated when programs fail in mid-task on a device. He was then able to recreate a technique that caused the controlled crashes.
Two independent security researchers who reviewed ZecOps’ discovery found the evidence credible, but said they had not yet fully recreated its findings. 
Patrick Wardle, an Apple security expert and former researcher for the U.S. National Security Agency, said the discovery “confirms what has always been somewhat of a rather badly kept secret: that well-resourced adversaries can remotely and silently infect fully patched iOS devices.” 
Because Apple was not aware of the software bug until recently, it could have been very valuable to governments and contractors offering hacking services. Exploit programs that work without warning against an up-to-date phone can be worth more than $1 million.
While Apple is largely viewed within the cybersecurity industry as having a high standard for digital security, any successful hacking technique against the iPhone could affect millions due to the device’s global popularity. In 2019, Apple said there were about 900 million iPhones in active use. 
Bill Marczak, a security researcher with Citizen Lab, a Canada-based academic security research group, called the vulnerability discovery “scary.” 

“A lot of times, you can take comfort from the fact that hacking is preventable,” said Marczak. “With this bug, it doesn’t matter if you’ve got a PhD in cybersecurity, this will eat your lunch.”"

Markey urged President Donald Trump s administration to balance public health needs as states seek to allow businesses to reopen their doors with the privacy rights of individuals who may be monitored.
Alphabet  s Google and Apple  said recently they were collaborating on technology to create smartphone apps that would help identify people who have crossed paths with a contagious person and alert them.
""The federal government must provide leadership, coordination, and guidance to ensure that contact tracing efforts are effective and do not infringe upon individuals  civil liberties, including the right to privacy,"" Markey wrote in a letter to Vice President Mike Pence.
Markey urged that any contact tracing be limited to what is needed to track disease exposure, include investment in public health, and be voluntary, subject to enforceable rules and transparent about what data is collected and what happens to it.
He urged that a minimum of data be collected and that it be kept securely and discarded in a timely fashion.
Markey s concerns echoed those of fellow Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who has said that the companies face a ""rightfully skeptical public"" when it comes to privacy.
Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of the Big Tech companies, sent a letter on Tuesday to Google s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook to demand that they be liable for any privacy lapses in contract tracing.
""If you seek to assure the public, make your stake in this project personal,"" Hawley wrote. ""Make a commitment that you and other executives will be personally liable if you stop protecting privacy, such as by granting advertising companies access to the interface once the pandemic is over.""
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Previously, they have said that ""privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance."" The companies have said that the technology - planned to be released in mid-May - would not track users  locations but their interactions, that interactions would be anonymized and nothing would be monetized."

SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Hynix (KS:000660) warned on Thursday that demand for chips will remain volatile, while restrictions on global movement, if prolonged, could disrupt production, sales and product development across the industry.
The South Korean chipmaker, which counts Apple Inc  among its customers, posted a 41% drop in quarterly profit, but beat estimates by a large margin as server demand due to the coronavirus-driven shift to working from home partly offset weak smartphone business.
SK Hynix reported an operating profit of 800 billion won ($649 million) in the January to March period, higher than a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 474 billion won, but still well below an operating profit of 1.4 trillion won a year earlier.
""There are a lot of uncertainties about the outlook for supply and prices for servers in the second half,"" Cha Jin-seok, SK Hynix s chief financial officer, told a conference call. 
While the global smartphone market is expected to post a sharper decline this year than last year, the chipmaker said it is positive about demand for servers and PCs as more people are at home, boosting demand for online education, video streaming and e-commerce.
""The biggest factor to our demand forecast is the stablisation of COVID-19 and the recovery timing of global economic activity. If the economic recession is prolonged, we can t rule out that even memory demand for servers could slow down,"" Cha said. 
SK Hynix shares dipped 0.95%, lagging a 0.76% rise in the wider market (KS11). 
CURRENCY TAILWIND
SK Hynix said shipments of DRAM chips, used in smartphones, PCs and servers, to remain flat in the current quarter from the previous quarter.
""Its forecast is lower than the market expected, and SK Hynix will see a bigger impact from coronavirus impact on mobile phones, despite robust server demand,"" Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities, said.
Overseas peers, which have recently reported strong first-quarter earnings, have also sounded a cautious note about the current outlook. 
Texas Instruments Inc  forecast current-quarter earnings largely below Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330) trimmed its full-year revenue outlook.
SK Hynix said its first-quarter revenue rose 6% to 7.2 trillion won. 
A weaker South Korean currency, which fell to its lowest level since 2009 in mid-March, provided a tailwind for South Korean exporters like Samsung and SK Hynix by boosting the value of overseas revenue when repatriated. 

SK Hynix s bigger rival, Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), also earlier this month flagged forecast-beating operating profit for the January to March quarter. "

SEOUL (Reuters) - Apple Inc  supplier LG Display Co Ltd warned of a sharp contraction in demand for TVs and smartphones as a result of the new coronavirus outbreak in the current quarter, after widening its first-quarter losses. 
The South Korean panel maker posted its fifth straight quarter of operating losses, as the coronavirus pandemic added to the problems of the industry already grappling with demand falls and a supply glut.
LG Display posted an operating loss of 362 billion won ($294.70 million), better than Refinitiv SmartEstimate s 390 billion won loss, but nearly triple the operating loss of 132 billion won a year earlier. 
Revenue fell 20% to 4.7 trillion won.
LG Display said an increase in working from home and online activities meant demand for products such as monitors, laptops and tablets would increase in the second quarter, but it might not be enough to offset weak demand for TVs and smartphones.
""We expect volatility in demand to increase down the road,"" LG Display said. 
Analysts also said the spread of the coronavirus across the globe would lead to further losses.
""It s likely that LG Display will continue to have another quarterly loss, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus on North America and Europe, which now have become its epicentre,"" Park Kang-ho, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said. 
LG Display s shares ended up 0.5% versus the wider market s fall of 0.98%. Its earnings announcement was issued after the market close.
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS 
The flat-screen maker also said it delayed production at its new Chinese factory for its advanced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display to the second quarter, citing difficulties in deploying technical staff because of travel restrictions caused by COVID-19. It had aimed to start production at the factory in Guangzhou in the first quarter.
Although liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices rose when production was disrupted in China at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak there, the price increases were shortlived as Chinese rivals resumed production, contributing to a supply glut.
Prices for LG Display s main product, 50-inch LCDs for television sets, rose just over 1% in the quarter from the previous quarter, data from WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce, showed. 
To try to stem losses, LG Display has said it will halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by the end of this year.

Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, said last month it would end all production of LCD panels by the end of this year."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has chosen a home-grown technology for smartphone-based tracing of coronavirus infections, putting it at odds with Apple  which has refused on privacy grounds to support the necessary short-range communication on iPhones.
The government has told lawmakers it has chosen a design developed for the Robert Koch Institute - the agency leading Germany s coronavirus health response - that would hold personal data on a central server.
Countries around the world are rushing to launch digital contact tracing apps to identify who an infected person has had contact with as part of efforts to slow the spread of the pandemic. 
In Europe, governments want to use Bluetooth  handshakes  between devices as a way to measure the risk of infection, but approaches differ as to whether such contacts should be logged on devices or on a central server.
Germany, lawmakers told Reuters, has backed the centralised platform developed by the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) consortium and an app built by one of its members, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.
""This solution requires the central storage of anonymised data, but represents a workable approach in terms of data protection and security,"" said Tankred Schipanski, digital affairs spokesman of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives.
Apple has, however, refused to allow such apps to monitor Bluetooth while running in the background. Apple and Alphabet  s Google have proposed tweaks that would best support device-based, decentralised apps.
""The chancellery is in talks with Apple but so far no solution is in sight,"" opposition lawmaker Anke Domscheit-Berg said after parliament s digital affairs committee was briefed by a government representative on Wednesday.
EUROPEAN SCHISM
Ideally, such national contact tracing apps would be interoperable, enabling them to  talk  to each other across borders and making it possible to lift restrictions on travel that have crushed economic activity.
But Europe has split into two camps with Germany, France, Italy and Britain backing centralised solutions. 
France has clashed with Apple over Bluetooth tracking while Thierry Breton, the European Union s industry chief, has told Apple CEO Tim Cook that apps being developed by governments should work on its devices.
Leaders of the expert community have, meanwhile, come out strongly against a centralised approach, with 300 scientists signing an open letter this week that said it ""would allow unprecedented surveillance of society at large"". 

An alternative, decentralised protocol developed called Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/DP3T%20White%20Paper.pdf) will be used for a Swiss app and may be adopted by Austria, whose Stopp Corona app has been downloaded 400,000 times."

""The objective would be an IPO over the next few years,"" Ray Bingham, who is also interim CEO of Imagination, told the newspaper.
Canyon Bridge, which is backed by Chinese state-owned China Reform Holdings, tried recently to appoint new four directors to Imagination s board, raising British government concern that the company would be moved to China.
The board meeting was cancelled at the request of the government.
Imagination and Canyon Bridge had a telephone meeting with Britain s Culture Minister on Friday, during whch the company and its owner said they had discussed their ongoing commitment to remain a UK-headquartered business.

Canyon Bridge bought Imagination in 2017 for 550 million pounds ($679 million) after its biggest customer Apple  said it would develop more of its own graphics technology, sending the British company s shares down 70%."

Democratic U.S. Representative David Cicilline s proposal attempts to ensure that large companies do not wipe out competition from smaller rivals already hit hard by the pandemic.
Mega-mergers and corporate takeovers that were permitted during the last economic crisis led to the firing of millions of workers, the slowing of investment and innovation, and huge increases in executive compensation, Cicilline said during an event hosted by the Open Markets Institute, a Washington-based antitrust advocacy group.
""We must take immediate action to halt this trend by including a moratorium in the upcoming stimulus package on all transactions that do not involve firms that are truly failing or in bankruptcy,"" Cicilline said.
He said there can be room left ""for merger activity that is necessary to ensuring that distressed firms have a fresh start through the bankruptcy process or through necessary divestitures while also ensuring that we do not undergo another period of rampant and unhealthy consolidation.""
Cicilline s comments come at a time when his committee is conducting an antitrust probe into tech giants including Amazon  , Facebook , Alphabet s Google  and Apple . That probe was set to end in March but has been delayed by the pandemic.

Any attempts to put changes like this in future stimulus bills would likely face fierce opposition from Wall Street banks, which earn big fees from merger and acquisition activity and the business lobbying groups which see mergers as a way to build businesses quickly."

Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for its modem chips, a crucial part that connects devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks.
In a bid to make its own chips, Apple bought a majority of Intel s modem business last July for $1 billion and settled a long legal battle with supplier  Qualcomm Inc   over the chipmaker s patent licensing practices.
Apple s Mac computers generated $7.16 billion in revenue in the last reported quarter while Intel s PC unit that includes modem chip sales recorded $10 billion in sales in the last quarter.

ARIZONA CARDINALS
Safety: The Cardinals have 2019 fifth-round pick Deionte Thompson but little else behind starters Jalen Thompson and Budda Baker. In a division featuring the 49ers  George Kittle, the Rams  tandem of Tyler Higbee and Gerald Everett and a rotation of pass-catching threats in Seattle, the Cardinals need safeties who can cover tight ends.
ATLANTA FALCONS
Cornerback: Releasing Desmond Trufant left a gaping hole. If Florida s C.J. Henderson isn t available at the 16th overall pick, Atlanta might wait until the second round, where the position group gets deeper with Utah s Jaylon Johnson, Clemson s A.J. Terrell and Mississippi State s Cameron Dantzler.
BALTIMORE RAVENS
Edge rusher: Keeping outside linebacker Matt Judon, slapped with the franchise tag in March, is a start, but the Ravens recorded only 37 sacks last season and had another major reshuffling of personnel through free agency. New defensive end Calais Campbell will help. Rush linebacker Jaylon Ferguson can be part of a rotation but isn t a star. Iowa s A.J. Epenesa could fall after a subpar combine.
BUFFALO BILLS
Right tackle: Perhaps Cody Ford (a 2019 second-rounder) deserves more time, but Buffalo would likely be best off bumping him to right guard and finding a new starter at right tackle. TCU s Lucas Niang, who is coming off hip surgery but was once regarded as a first-round talent, could be a target with the 54th overall pick. Georgia s Isaiah Wilson would also fit as a bruiser next to Ford.
CAROLINA PANTHERS
Cornerback: The NFC South has big-play wide receivers, and while Carolina finished 13th against the pass much was due to playing from behind. Ohio State s Jeffrey Okudah would make sense if available at No. 7. Otherwise, the Panthers might wait until the second round.
CHICAGO BEARS
Offensive linemen: The most pressing need is at left guard, where the retirement of Kyle Long creates a major void. The interior of the line was inconsistent in 2019, but right tackle could be upgraded if Bobby Massie is viewed as a better option inside.
CINCINNATI BENGALS
Quarterback: Head coach Zac Taylor knows he has to get this one right for the Bengals to set a winning foundation. LSU quarterback Joe Burrow s Ohio roots are a small piece of the equation. The Heisman Trophy winner checks a lot of boxes.
CLEVELAND BROWNS
Offensive tackle: New general manager Andrew Berry scored a right tackle in free agency in former first-round pick Jack Conklin, but the gaping vacancy at left tackle remains. Massive Louisville tackle Mekhi Becton and Georgia s Andrew Thomas are coveted prospects who could be there when the Browns pick at No. 10.
DALLAS COWBOYS
Center: Travis Frederick s retirement was a surprise, but at least it occurred before the draft. The Cowboys had a test run at life without Frederick in 2018 when he missed the whole season, and Joe Looney held up but was nowhere near Frederick s All-Pro caliber. Dak Prescott was sacked 56 times and the interior line was walloped. If Dallas gets a shot at Tyler Biadasz, it could reel him in.
DENVER BRONCOS
Wide receiver: The Broncos resisted a move for a wide receiver in free agency because of the draft s outstanding class. Alabama s Henry Ruggs would pair perfectly with Courtland Sutton, but he might be gone by 15th overall. Crimson Tide teammate Jerry Jeudy or Oklahoma s CeeDee Lamb might be available. In Round 2, options could include TCU s Jalen Reagor or Arizona State s Brandon Aiyuk.
DETROIT LIONS
Defensive end: With the No. 3 pick, the Lions should have a chance to fill one of their two greatest needs, considering Ohio State defensive end Chase Young or cornerback Jeffrey Okudah is likely to be on the board.
GREEN BAY PACKERS
Tight end: Marcedes Lewis is 36, but he s back and atop the depth chart in Green Bay. Jimmy Graham (Chicago Bears) is gone after declining production. A playmaker would make life easier for wide receiver Davante Adams. Last year s third-round pick, Jace Sternberger, was on injured reserve until November and never made an impact.
HOUSTON TEXANS
Wide receiver: Bill O Brien traded arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL -- DeAndre Hopkins -- and received a return worthy of a No. 2 wideout. Randall Cobb and Brandin Cooks round out a nice group, but there s no true alpha. Penn State s KJ Hamler and Notre Dame s Chase Claypool are targets for Houston with the 40th overall pick.
INDIANAPOLIS COLTS
Wide receiver: T.Y. Hilton will enjoy working with Philip Rivers. Rivers loves to launch, and behind this offensive line there should be plenty of opportunity for the two to connect. Hilton played hurt most of last season, and 2019 second-round pick Parris Campbell never made a move.
JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS
Cornerback: In a 14-week span, the Jaguars traded Pro Bowl cornerbacks Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye, dousing what had been a flourishing homegrown secondary. But they hold the ninth and 20th picks, and Ohio State s Jeffrey Okudah and Florida s CJ Henderson represent dream draft scenarios for GM Dave Caldwell.
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS
Cornerback: Bashaud Breeland re-signed, but only for one year, and the group of Charvarius Ward, Rashad Fenton and Keith Reaser isn t inspiring. Kansas City should upgrade by the end of Round 2, with Clemson s A.J. Terrell, Alabama s Trevon Diggs or LSU s Kristian Fulton all options at No. 32 overall.
LAS VEGAS RAIDERS
Cornerback: Even before the signing of Eli Apple  fell through, the Raiders needed help at cornerback. Florida s CJ Henderson would be a great option at No. 12 or No. 19.
LOS ANGELES CHARGERS
Quarterback: Don t put it past Anthony Lynn to roll with Tyrod Taylor as his starter, but the Chargers look primed to take a quarterback in the first round after Philip Rivers walked. Will they trade up for Alabama s Tua Tagovailoa? If not, Oregon s Justin Herbert seems likely at No. 6.
LOS ANGELES RAMS
Center: Brian Allen and Austin Blythe did not adequately fill the void created by the departure of John Sullivan. Allen missed much of the season. Blythe s more natural position is guard. Tyler Biadasz is a name to watch from the Wisconsin offensive line factory, but the 2020 center class is very deep.
MIAMI DOLPHINS
Quarterback: The Dolphins have been connected to Alabama s Tua Tagovailoa for more than a year. With Tagovailoa s recovery from hip surgery apparently on schedule, the question is whether he ll be available at No. 5 overall. Miami might have to jump up a few spots for Tagovailoa, but would the Dolphins be just as happy with Oregon s Justin Herbert?
MINNESOTA VIKINGS
Wide receiver: Trading Stefon Diggs leaves the Vikings with Adam Thielen at No. 1. Tajae Sharpe came on board to compete with a bunch of underdogs for No. 2.
NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS
Tight end: The Patriots never really addressed Rob Gronkowski s departure last offseason, despite a terrific draft class at the position. This year s group is far less exciting. New England might miss out on Notre Dame s Cole Kmet, but Dayton s Adam Trautman or Florida Atlantic s Harrison Bryant might be there in Round 3.
NEW ORLEANS SAINTS
Linebacker: Kiko Alonso and Alex Anzalone are coming off serious injuries while Demario Davis is in a contract year. The Saints don t have a lot of draft picks, but they likely need to add a few linebackers.
NEW YORK GIANTS
Edge rusher: The Giants had 36 sacks last season, and Markus Golden, who led the team with 10, hasn t been re-signed. Defensive end Leonard Williams  (franchise tag) was retained, but the outside linebacker spots are bereft of finishers. Darrell Taylor (Tennessee) and Terrell Lewis (Alabama) are second-round targets the Giants are monitoring.
NEW YORK JETS
Offensive tackle: GM Joe Douglas  only free agent reinforcement at tackle was the unproven George Fant, but asking Fant and Chuma Edoga (a 2019 third-rounder) to solve the protection woes is too optimistic. Fortunately for the Jets, a top tackle -- Alabama s Jedrick Wills, Iowa s Tristan Wirfs, Louisville s Mekhi Becton and Georgia s Andrew Thomas, in some order -- should be there at No. 11 overall.
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES
Wide receiver: Greg Ward came out of nowhere to play like a No. 1, but that s not an expectation for a full season. Alshon Jeffery, 30, and DeSean Jackson, 33, are dragging significant durability concerns into 2020, so the time to find the next lead receiver is now. Colorado s Laviska Shenault and Alabama s Henry Ruggs III could get a long look.
PITTSBURGH STEELERS
Defensive tackle: Javon Hargrave is a considerable loss because of his nonstop motor inside. Acquiring Chris Wormley appears to be a short-term fix, and the XFL options the team added are no sure thing.
SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS
Defensive tackle: Trading DeForest Buckner brought the 13th overall pick in return. With a strong set of edge rushers, look for the 49ers to address the interior defensive line with at least one of their two first-round picks. South Carolina s Javon Kinlaw is one of the draft s biggest boom-or-bust prospects.
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS
Defensive end: Whether or not Jadeveon Clowney moves on, upgrading the pass rush remains the No. 1 goal. Bruce Irvin and Benson Mayowa were brought back, but more help is needed after Seattle recorded just 28 sacks. Penn State s Yetur Gross-Matos fits GM John Schneider s preference for length and speed.
TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS
Offensive tackle: The Bucs signed four-year veteran Joe Haeg. He has 35 games of starting experience, but he played only 74 offensive snaps as a reserve for the Indianapolis Colts last year. Iowa s Tristan Wirfs and Louisville s massive Mekhi Becton (6-foot-7, 364 pounds) could be options at No. 14.
TENNESSEE TITANS
Edge: Yetur Gross-Matos (Penn State) is widely projected to be picked in the 20s. The Titans  first pick at No. 29 might present better options to trade back with teams coveting a specific need, but Gross-Matos has size, athleticism and the ability to play defensive end or tackle.
WASHINGTON REDSKINS

Edge rusher: The No. 2 pick puts first-year Redskins coach Ron Rivera in position to draft his version of Julius Peppers - picked second overall in 2002 by the Carolina Panthers - in Ohio State s Chase Young. Young is considered more polished than last year s No. 2 pick, Buckeyes teammate Nick Bosa."

San Francisco-based cybersecurity firm ZecOps on Wednesday detailed a flaw that it said may have left more than half a billion iPhones vulnerable to hackers.
Zuk Avraham, ZecOps  chief executive, told Reuters he found evidence the vulnerability was exploited in at least six cybersecurity break-ins. 
Avraham said he found evidence that an attacker was taking advantage of the vulnerability as far back as January 2018, but that he could not determine who the hackers were.
Reuters was unable to independently verify his claim.
Apple on Wednesday acknowledged the vulnerability existed in its software for email on iPhones and iPads, known as the Mail app, and said the company had developed a fix that will be introduced in a forthcoming update to millions of devices it has sold globally. 
On Thursday, Apple disputed Avraham s evidence that the hack had been used against users.
""We have thoroughly investigated the researcher s report and, based on the information provided, have concluded these issues do not pose an immediate risk to our users,"" Apple said in a statement. ""The researcher identified three issues in Mail, but alone they are insufficient to bypass iPhone and iPad security protections, and we have found no evidence they were used against customers.""

In response to Apple s statement, ZecOps said it found evidence of related hacks against ""a few organizations"" and that it would share additional technical information once Apple released its software update to the public."

Investing.com -- The latest $484 billion U.S. economic support package will be signed by President Trump later, after the House ratified by a large, bipartisan majority. Stocks are set to open a little higher, recovering after Gilead Sciences  deflated hopes for a quick cure to the Covid-19 virus. The euro hit a one-month low after EU leaders fell out again over the shape and size of its recovery plan for the economy, while U.K. retail sales and German business confidence fell by the most on record. Oil, however, has stabilized,partly because brokerages are making it harder for clients to bet on it after this week s shenanigans. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 24th April
1. Stimulus bill passes; Mnuchin eyes support for oil industry
The latest $484 billion economic support bill, which tops up the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and also channels extra funds to hospitals and testing, will be signed by President Donald Trump after passing the House of Representatives with bipartisan vote late on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg in an interview that the administration is looking at setting up a lending facility specifically for the oil and gas industry to help it through the current extraordinary volatility.
He added that he s looking at a lot of different options and has not made any conclusions. House Democrats blocked Mnuchin’s proposals to support the domestic oil industry through purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an earlier stimulus bill.
2. Grim data as Europe fails to agree on a recovery plan
The U.K.’s retail sales fell by the most ever in March, while Germany’s closely-watched Ifo business climate index also slumped to its lowest ever in April, data out Friday showed.
The news came on top of fresh disappointment at European leaders’ failure to craft a convincing policy response to the economic crisis fast unfolding. An EU summit on Thursday agreed in principle to establish a ‘recovery fund’ but couldn’t agree on how to finance it, or how big it should be.
The combination of news pushed European stock markets lower and sovereign bond spreads wider. Italy in particular is in the spotlight as Standard & Poor’s is widely expected to cut its long-term rating after the close today. At BBB, the rating is currently two notches above junk.
The euro fell to a one-month low of $1.0727 earlier before recovering slightly.
3. Stocks set to open higher despite lingering drug disappointment
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, recovering from Thursday s disappointment regading a possible cure to the Covid-19 coronavirus.
By 6:20 AM ET (1020 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 98 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.3%.
Gilead Sciences pushed back on Thursday against a report alleging that the first results of tests examining the usefulness of its experimental drug remdesivir in treating Covid-19 had been negative.  Gilead styled the trial ‘inconclusive’.
The market had withstood another miserable week of initial jobless claims before Gilead’s news, suggesting that it shouldn’t get too bent out of shape by durable goods orders and consumer sentiment data at 8:30 and 10 AM, respectively.
4. Chipmaker down after pulling guidance; More telecom and bank earnings due 
Intel stock fell 4.5% in premarket trading after the company pulled its guidance for the year, despite beating expectations in the first quarter. The stock is being buffeted by reports that Apple  is set to drop its chips from the next generation of Mac computers next year.
E-Trade and Capital One may also come under pressure at the open after missing expectations in their updates after the closing bell on Thursday.
Today’s earnings roster is headed by Verizon and American Express both reporting before the open.
5. Oil stabilizes as brokers tighten their rules
Oil prices settled into a range after an unprecedented week of volatility, as technical pressures arising from the expiry of May futures contracts eased. There was no major news to change the short-term supply-demand outlook.
By 6:10 AM, U.S. crude futures were down 2.2% at $16.14 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.2% at $21.29 a barrel. Both blends are still down by over 60% from the start of the year, however.  
TD Ameritrade  and other retail brokerages have taken action to stop clients building new positions in both benchmarks, while some have also raised margin requirements."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, but quickly pared gains as the market digested Thursday s disappointment over Gilead Sciences   experimental drug remdesivir, and took comfort in the passage of the latest $484 billion economic support package to be approved by Congress. 
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was effectively unchanged at 23,520 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.2%.  
Fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to be the main factors supporting many stocks close to the levels where they started the year. The Nasdaq is now down only 5.5% for the year to date, thanks largely to the pandemic accelerating structural shifts towards streaming, remote work and online shopping. 
Durable goods orders and consumer sentiment were the latest data points to show the extent of the damage on the economy, the University of Michigan sentiment index falling slightly less than expected from its preliminary measure to 71.8 - still a record low. Durable goods orders also collapsed, but held up better than expected once the highly volatile aircraft component was stripped out of it.  Boeing  stock fell 3.7% after it announced on Thursday it would halve production of the Dreamliner 787. 
Investors are warning that for the rest of the market, the path back to ""normality"" will be long and bumpy.
""What seems increasingly clear to us is that the path back to normal is looking more like a marathon than a sprint,"" said BlueBay Asset Management chief investment officer Mark Dowding in e-mailed comments.  He compared the fight against the virus to the First World War.
""At the onset of the First World War, there was initially a belief that it would be ‘all over by Christmas’, only for the grim reality of trench warfare to drag on for years to follow,"" Dowding said.
""This isn’t meant to be an overly bleak or pessimistic prognosis,"" he added, ""just an admission that as we learn more, we need to accept and understand that it will be some time before life goes back to the way it was.""
Elsewhere, Zoom Video  rose another 5.6% to a fresh all-time high after being included in the Nasdaq 100 index, while oil and gas stocks rose across the board after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hinted at a rescue facility for the industry.
U.S. crude futures have settled into a range after the volatility earlier this week around settlement of the May futures contract, and were up 4.1% at $17.17 by 10:10 AM.
 Exxon Mobil   stock was up 1.2%, while the more highly levered Oasis Petroleum   was up 11.7%. 
Intel  stock was down 2.9% after reports that its chips will be dropped from Apple s  next generation of Mac computers, while Verizon  stock fell 0.7% after it took a $228 million charge against possible non-payment of bills as customers lost their jobs in droves due to the pandemic."

LONDON (Reuters) - The technology and healthcare sectors have tightened their grip on global stock markets since the coronavirus shock knocked world shares from February s record highs.
While banks, airlines and oil majors have been dumped by investors and the value of their shares has plummeted, sectors including the likes of pharma giant Roche  and the U.S. tech heavyweights now account for 42.8% of world stocks - more than twice that of energy and financial shares.
Healthcare and technology stocks globally have been resilient to the ongoing virus shock, with investors pumping $4.9 billion into those sectors in the last week, according to BofA Research.
Facebook , Apple , Amazon , Alphabet  and Microsoft  weigh a whopping 8.7% of global equity markets.

Part of the explanation of why healthcare and tech stocks  are ruling supreme over trading floors is their resilience during the COVID-19 crisis. 
World Healthcare stocks are down only 4.8% from their February highs while the tech sector, down 15%, has outperformed the 19.5% loss of the broader market.

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - A standoff between the two largest nations in the European Union and Silicon Valley escalated on Friday as Apple  and Google rebuffed demands by France and Germany to back their approach to using smartphone technology to trace coronavirus infections.
Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk that one person can infect another with the coronavirus, helping to isolate those who could spread the COVID-19 disease.
In Europe, most countries have chosen short-range Bluetooth  handshakes  between devices as the best approach, dismissing the alternative of using location data pursued by some countries in Asia as intrusive. 
But a rift has opened up between countries led by France and Germany that want to hold personal data on a central server, and others that back a decentralized approach in which Bluetooth logs are stored on individual devices. 
Apple and Alphabet  s Google, whose operating systems run 99% of smartphones, have promised tweaks in May that would accommodate the decentralized approach. A trial version is due out next week.
That has added a political dimension to the standards-setting debate, with a senior French official saying it was time for Europe to stop caving in to pressure from the United States.
""The European states are being completely held hostage by Google and Apple,"" said the official, who is involved in coordinating efforts to develop a French contact-tracing app called StopCovid.
BACKGROUND CHECK
Although Bluetooth-based smartphone contact tracing is an untested technology and early results in countries like Singapore are modest, its development is already redefining the relationship between the state and individual.
Reversing a debate that normally pits privacy-conscious Europeans against a data-hungry U.S.-tech industry, it is Apple that has refused to allow Bluetooth monitoring of other devices to run in the background on its iPhones. Such monitoring would open the way to greater state surveillance, say privacy experts.
That creates a problem for France and Germany as now, for their apps to work, a phone would need to be unlocked and have Bluetooth running in the foreground - a drain on the battery and an inconvenience for the user.
Germany also called on Apple to support the app being developed by research group Fraunhofer HHI for the Robert Koch Institute, the federal agency that is coordinating the national health policy response to coronavirus.
""The federal government has great trust in the system that is being tested by Fraunhofer,"" government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer told a news conference. ""With a decentralized system, you have to trust Apple and Google.""
PRIVACY FIRST
Senior executives from Apple and Google said on Friday that they had jointly designed tools with the express goal of supporting decentralized contact-tracing apps they say provide the best privacy protection to users.
""Those privacy principles are not going to change,"" Gary Davis, Apple s global director of privacy and law enforcement requests, told a webinar hosted by the liberal Renew faction in the European Parliament.
""They are fundamental minimum privacy principles that are needed to make this work.""
Dave Burke, vice president for engineering at Google, endorsed the decentralized DP-3T protocol developed by a Swiss-led team of researchers, calling it ""the best privacy-preserving solution"".
It was preferable, Burke said, to support a single standard to ensure that national contact tracing apps can talk to each other across borders.
""Trying to support more than one approach is going to add to the fragmentation, cause cross-border problems and really defeat the whole purpose,"" he said.
Switzerland plans to launch a Bluetooth app on May 11 based on DP-3T, which stands for Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing. It was joined on Friday by Estonia, which also plans an app based on the DP-3T standard.

Austria s Red Cross, whose Stopp Corona contact tracing app was the first to go live in Europe last month and has been downloaded 400,000 times, said this week it would upgrade its architecture and was leaning towards adopting DP-3T."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  and Alphabet Inc s  Google on Friday updated technical details of the coronavirus contact tracing system they plan to release next month, saying new features would strengthen privacy protections and give health authorities more detailed data.
The system announced on April 10 will use Bluetooth technology to let authorities build apps to alert people who have been in proximity with those who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
The technology does not employ GPS location data and stores most sensitive data in a decentralized way on users  phones. The approach opened a rift with European governments planning systems that would store data on centralized servers.
Without the Apple-Google technology, apps built by those governments will face limitations such as needing a phone s screen to be unlocked to work properly.
Health and privacy researchers also cited privacy concerns that the companies addressed on Friday by making it harder to use system-generated data to track people. 
The numbers that identify users will be randomly generated, and so-called ""metadata"" such as Bluetooth signal strength and users  phone models will now be encrypted along with primary data about who they have been near.
""Exposure time,"" or how long two phones have been near each other, will be rounded to 5-minute intervals, to prevent using detailed time data to match up phones to people.
The companies also sought to address health researchers  concerns that the system would be ineffective. Since Bluetooth signals can penetrate some walls and can be detected even when brief and faint, researchers worried about false alerts from neighbors in apartment buildings or passers-by in public spaces.
Apple and Google will now provide data about Bluetooth power levels to better estimate how close two phones came to each other and for how long, letting authorities set their own thresholds for when to alert people.

The companies also said they would provide data on how many days had passed since the last contact with an infected person, to help authorities notify users about what steps to take."

Investing.com – The Dow turned higher on Friday, led by tech as investors weighed up further evidence of weakness in the economy against the backdrop of fresh economic stimulus measures.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.60%, the S&P 500 rose 0.84%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.03%.
In a further sign the economic downturn is likely to be severe, U.S. durable goods orders fell by 14.4% last month, the biggest slide since 2014, led by waning demand for big-ticket items such as cars and slump in orders for Boeing  passenger planes.
But some on Wall Street suggested the underlying data was more resilient and the weakness was largely driven by transportation orders.
""Outside of transportation, we saw an underlying resiliency in the face of the lockdowns, at least in March,"" Jefferies said in a note.
The weaker-than-expected data come just as President Donald Trump signed the $484 billion coronavirus stimulus package into law to ease the Covid-19 hit to the economy at a time when some states are set to reopen.
But with worries over the pandemic still running high, some of the biggest companies are wary of opening for business, with Macy’s , Gap , and TGI Fridays choosing to remain shuttered in states such as Georgia and South Carolina.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, moved off session lows to trade 1% higher even as oil prices lost some gains into settlement.  
But ahead of major tech earnings next week, including from Facebook , Alphabet , Apple  and Amazon , investors showed some interest in the sector.
Chip stocks also edged higher, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 2%, as Intel  cut its losses to trade flat.
Intel reported earnings that topped estimates, but the chipmaker pulled its guidance, stoking concerns its future growth is more likely to ease rather than accelerate.
Airlines, meanwhile, were given a slight lift off the lows after President Trump reportedly suggested the government should buy ""4-5 years worth of airline tickets"" in advance to boost airlines."

(Reuters) - With the U.S. quarterly earnings season picking up steam this week, investors have caught a glimpse of how companies are weathering the coronavirus outbreak, including the strength of their balance sheets.
With little clarity on when the U.S. economy will reopen, companies of all sizes have been bracing for months of limited revenues. Several corporations have reduced or suspended dividends, slowed capital spending and cut jobs and wages to save money.
Companies have also raced to raise as much credit as possible and preserve liquidity, allowing corporations including  Intel Corp   and  Coca-Cola Co   to end the March quarter with much higher cash balances. Delta Air Lines  said in its report on Wednesday that it had raised $5.4 billion of capital since early March.
Next week, Wall Street s most valuable companies are scheduled report their results, including  Microsoft Corp  , Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc , as well has energy heavyweights  Exxon Mobil  Corp  and  Chevron  Corp . 
The following graphic shows companies that reported this week, along with their cash and short-term investments in recent quarters.

(Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Friday, led higher by Apple and Microsoft as investors finished a turbulent week of trading and some states prepared to relax coronavirus-related lockdowns.
Apple  and Microsoft  each climbed more than 1%, lifting the S&P 500 more than any other companies. The two tech titans are on tap to report their March-quarter results next week, giving investors a glimpse at how the pandemic has affected their global businesses.
 Boeing Co   tumbled more than 6% after a report the planemaker was planning to cut 787 Dreamliner output by about half.
All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes moved up, with information technology (SPLRCT) jumping 2.1% and materials (SPLRCM) rallying 1.5%.
Even with Friday s gains, the S&P 500 ended the week lower, with investors fearful of a deep economic slump following a near-crash in April business activity and weekly jobless claims topping 26 million in five weeks.
The index has recovered more than 25% from its March low and expectations are growing that more businesses will be allowed to reopen as coronavirus infections showed signs of peaking.
Georgia became the first state to push ahead with its plan to allow an array of small businesses to reopen on Friday despite disapproval from President Donald Trump and health experts.
Investors may be overestimating how quickly U.S. businesses can go back to normal, and the S&P 500 could fall 5% or more as it becomes evident that resuming normal economic activity may not happen for months, warned Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in North Carolina. 
""We think this is likely to be a little bit of a sideways market, and we won t be surprised to see a bit of downside before we see more upside,"" Freedman said.
Overall, analysts still expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to slump more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.
New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly rose in March, but the gains are not likely to be sustainable amid the pandemic, which has abruptly shut down the economy and contributed to a collapse in crude oil prices.
The CBOE volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street s fear gauge, was down for the third straight session.
Amazon  rose 0.4% to a record high close ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday. With online shopping booming as people avoid traditional stores, Amazon s stock market value has ballooned by over $100 billion since Feb. 19, just before coronavirus fears gripped Wall Street.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) jumped 1.11% to end at 23,775.27 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.39% to 2,836.74.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1.65% to 8,634.52.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Dow lost 1.9% and the Nasdaq lost 0.2%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 14 new lows.

Facebook  closed 2.7% higher after rolling out a group video chat feature called Messenger Rooms as the social media giant looks to cash in on the ramp-up in demand for video conferences amid lockdown measures.
 Zoom Video Communications   reversed gains to end down 6%.
With major tech earnings hitting the tape next week, Alphabet , Apple  and Amazon  also ended higher.
Chip stocks also played a role in the rally, as Intel  cuts its losses, rising 0.3%.
Intel reported earnings that topped estimates, but the chipmaker pulled its guidance, stoking concerns its future growth is more likely to ease rather than accelerate.
The surge in tech stocks, however, was unable to prevent the broader market from falling to its first weekly loss in three weeks following declines earlier in the week amid a historical plunge in oil prices.
Oil prices settled 2.7% higher, though still ended the week 7% lower after settling in negative for the first time ever on Monday.
Adding to the surge in jobless claims earlier this week, a slump in U.S. durable goods orders provided further evidence the economic downturn will likely be severe.
U.S. durable goods orders fell by 14.4% last month, the biggest slide since 2014, led by waning demand for big-ticket items such as cars and a slump in orders for Boeing  passenger planes.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. states promoting apps that could prove essential to ending the coronavirus lockdown may be headed for a showdown with the two Silicon Valley companies that control key software on 99% of smartphones over the collection of sensitive GPS location data.
Apple Inc  and Alphabet  Inc s Google plan to release technology jointly in the coming weeks for digital contact tracing through Bluetooth sensors on phones. Public health authorities have determined that the technology is crucial to apps that will alert people when they have been close to people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
For contact tracing apps to work, however, millions of people must be willing to use them without fear their locations and other personal data is being tracked and stored.
Google and Apple have sought to build public trust by emphasizing that the changes they are making to Bluetooth to allow the tracing apps to work will not tap phones  GPS sensors, which privacy activists see as too intrusive. 
But the states pioneering the apps - North and South Dakota, and Utah - say allowing public health authorities to use GPS in tandem with Bluetooth is key to making the system viable.
The Bluetooth technology will enable users to be notified if they crossed paths with a coronavirus carrier, but will not specify where the encounter happened, information crucial to authorities who want to identify hotspots for virus transmission and move fast to stop outbreaks.
Apple and Google said on Friday that they still have not decided how to proceed.
""I would encourage them to go for the  and  and not the  or  solution,"" North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum said of Apple and Google in an interview late Thursday.
""During this new normal, there is a place for having solutions that protect privacy and enable more efficient contact tracing,"" said Burgum, himself a former software executive who sold a company to  Microsoft Corp   for more than $1 billion in 2001.
APPS AT WORK
Anonymized GPS location data is already playing a key role in an early version of Care19, an app that about 40,000 people have signed up for in North and South Dakota. 
Authorities currently ask Care19 users to give them permission for timestamped GPS location data, which allows officials to manually call places where users could have spread the virus and ask for names and numbers of others who may have been there at the same time.
This laborious process will no longer be necessary with the Bluetooth technology coming from Apple and Google, which will automatically catalog encounters between users and enable carriers to anonymously convey to others potentially infected that they should get tested. Without the changes the two companies are working on, iPhone users would have to keep their phone unlocked and app open at all times.
Utah’s Healthy Together contact tracing app, which launched on Wednesday, for now is using a workaround that only catalogs some encounters. Healthy Together also collects location data and its developers hope Apple and Google do not force them to drop that functionality to adopt the more comprehensive Bluetooth technology. 
""What Utah wanted to understand is not just who is spreading [the virus] to whom but also location zones,"" said Jared Allgood, chief strategy officer for Twenty, the startup which developed Utah’s app for an initial $1.75 million. 
GPS location data allows authorities to decide which businesses may need to be closed because the virus is spreading there, and prioritize which contacts of diagnosed patients to test. 
""Is it happening in a park, a Costco  or a Walmart? They are trying to make policy decisions that move our economy from a broad-based  everything is shut down  to a more targeted approach,"" Allgood said in an interview on Friday.
Privacy experts have warned that any cache of location data related to health issues could make businesses and individuals vulnerable to being ostracized if the data are exposed. 
But Tim Brookins, a principal engineer at Microsoft who previously worked for Burgum and developed Care19 independently of his employer, said location data is stored on a Microsoft Azure server that he rents and to which only he and one other person have the keys. North Dakota is paying about $9,000 to license Care19 for six months, he said. 
Allgood said the Utah app asks users for their phone number, but location data is stored anonymously in a server rented from Amazon  Web Services.
""We don’t see a reason why Apple or Google would not allow us to participate in their tools,"" said Diesel Peltz, Twenty’s CEO. 
Brookins and Burgum expressed confidence the two tech giants would allow for location data collection after seeing the safeguards Care19 has put in place, including not asking for users  names, phone numbers or email addresses. 
""Some people are completely opposed to an intrusion on privacy but there s a younger generation sharing their location on dozens of apps,"" Burgum said. 

""There may be a set of people highly social, young and going out to bars who may see this tool as fantastic."""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany changed course on Sunday over which type of smartphone technology it wanted to use to trace coronavirus infections, backing an approach supported by Apple  and Google  along with a growing number of other European countries.
Countries are rushing to develop apps to give a detailed picture of the risk of catching the coronavirus, as the chain of infection is proving hard to break because it can be spread by those showing no symptoms.
Chancellery Minister Helge Braun and Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a joint statement that Berlin would adopt a ""decentralised"" approach to digital contact tracing, thus abandoning a home-grown alternative that would have given health authorities central control over tracing data.
In Europe, most countries have chosen short-range Bluetooth ""handshakes"" between mobile devices as the best way of registering a potential contact, even though it does not provide location data.
But they have disagreed about whether to log such contacts on individual devices or on a central server - which would be more directly useful to existing contact tracing teams that work phones and knock on doors to warn those who may be at risk.
Under the decentralised approach, users could opt to share their phone number or details of their symptoms - making it easier for health authorities to get in touch and give advice on the best course of action in the event they are found to be at risk.
This consent would be given in the app, however, and not be part of the system s central architecture.
APPLE REFUSED TO BUDGE
Germany as recently as Friday backed a centralised standard called Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), which would have needed Apple in particular to change the settings on its iPhones.
When Apple refused to budge there was no alternative but to change course, said a senior government source.
In their joint statement, Braun and Spahn said Germany would now adopt a ""strongly decentralised"" approach.
""This app should be voluntary, meet data protection standards and guarantee a high level of IT security,"" they said. ""The main epidemiological goal is to recognise and break chains of infection as soon as possible.""
Bluetooth-based smartphone contact tracing operates by assessing the closeness and length of contact between people and, if a person tests positive for COVID-19, telling recent contacts to call a doctor, get tested or self-isolate.
Early results in countries such as Singapore are modest, however, especially when set against the technology s potential to redefine the relationship between state and individual.
An open letter from hundreds of scientists published last Monday warned that, if the contact tracing data was centralised, it would allow ""unprecedented surveillance of society at large"".
The tide was already running against PEPP-PT and its main backer, German tech entrepreneur Chris Boos, as collaborators pulled out, faulting its methodology and its slowness to open up its work to wider scrutiny.
""GRAVE ERRORS""
One of the members of PEPP-PT, Germany s Fraunhofer HHI research institute, was told on Saturday that it had been taken off the project, correspondence seen by Reuters showed. 
""A series of grave errors were made by PEPP-PT regarding communication that, at the end of the day, caused serious damage and led to this decision,"" Fraunhofer HHI head Thomas Wiegand said in a message to colleagues.
Germany s reversal brings it into line with a proposal by Apple and Google, who said this month they would develop new tools to support decentralised contact tracing. In Europe, France and Britain still back centralisation.
Centralised apps would not work properly on Apple s iPhone because, for Bluetooth exchanges to happen, the device would need to be unlocked with the app running in the foreground - a drain on the battery and an inconvenience to the user.
But the iPhone will integrate with decentralised protocols such as DP-3T, which has been developed by a Swiss-led team and has been backed by Switzerland, Austria and Estonia.
Backers of DP-3T, short for Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, say it is still possible for users voluntarily to opt in to sharing their phone number in order to pass epidemiologically useful data - although not location - to authorities to aid contact tracing. But this would be part of an app, not of the system architecture.

DP-3T, in a statement, welcomed Germany s change of heart. PEPP-PT did not respond to requests for comment."

The world s largest online retailer has long faced scrutiny over how it polices counterfeits and allegedly unsafe products on its platform. Fakes have frustrated top labels like Apple Inc  and  Nike  Inc  and discouraged some from selling via Amazon at all.
Amazon said its pilot began early this year and included in-person appointments with prospective sellers. However, it switched exclusively to video conferencing in February because of social distancing requirements related to the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 2.9 million people globally.
The interview vetting, on top of other risk-screening performed by Amazon, has been piloted with more than 1,000 merchant applicants based in China, the United States, United Kingdom and Japan, Amazon said.

The extra scrutiny by Amazon could make it harder for some China-based sellers, who have registered multiple accounts using private internet networks or fake utility bills. China-based merchants accounted for 40% of the top 10,000 Amazon sellers in Europe, according to 2019 research from firm Marketplace Pulse."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets rallied on Monday as the Bank of Japan added more stimulus to cushion the impact of the coronavirus and investors cheered news more countries were easing lockdowns, though the oil price took another tumble with storage running short.
The Bank of Japan matched market speculation by pledging to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds and sharply raising purchases of corporate and commercial debt, the latest in a raft of vast central bank stimulus plans that have helped propel a near 25% rally in global stock markets. 
The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meet later in the week, with the latter likely to do more bond buying.
Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said while he expected both meetings to focus chiefly on implementing current commitments, ""there might well be tweaks... to their various purchase and liquidity programmes"". 
The Euro STOXX 600 rose 1.8%, following on from decent gains on Asian markets. Germany s DAX rose 2.37%, France s CAC 40 1.93% and Britain s FTSE 100 1.66%.
Wall Street also looked set to open higher, with S&P futures 0.7% ahead.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.78%. The index is now up 25% from its low point on March 23, but is still some 22% off the highs in February before panic over the virus caused markets to tank.
Around 173 companies in the S&P 500 will report earnings this week, including Apple , Amazon , Facebook , Microsoft ,  Caterpillar  , Ford,  General Electric   and  Chevron  .
Analysts expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to have slumped more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults.
The United States and European Union both release first-quarter economic growth numbers this week, while the U.S. will also unveil the influential ISM survey on manufacturing.
But not everyone thinks the current crop of data is as relevant for markets, which have recently shrugged off huge rises in U.S. jobless claims to focus on how quickly economies will rebound as government-imposed lockdowns are lifted.
""I don’t know why people pay so much attention to today’s data. We know it’s all bad. The new information will come in the summer,"" said Stephen Jen, co-founder of hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital.
He said the ""tug of war"" between those predicting a sharp v-shaped rebound and those expecting a slower recovery would not begin in earnest until May s data. 
More U.S. states prepared to ease restrictions on commerce this week despite health experts warning that there is still too little testing in place, while some European countries further eased their lockdowns. 
OIL DROPS, ITALY GETS REPRIEVE
Oil prices weakened sharply again and looked set for another volatile week. 
Crude prices have fallen in eight of the last nine weeks, with U.S. crude even trading below zero last week as demand collapsed due to the pandemic and supply cuts failed to keep up, leaving more oil than could be stored. 
U.S. crude slid $2.29 to $14.65, while Brent crude futures slipped $1.1 to $20.34 a barrel. 
Italian government bond yields dropped between 14 and 17 basis points after S&P Global late Friday left the country s credit rating in investment grade territory. 
Investors had feared the ratings agency would cut heavily-indebted Italy to  junk .
Benchmark German 10-year bond yields were little changed, while U.S. Treasury yields rose marginally.

The U.S. dollar dipped as the broader upbeat mood encouraged investors to move back into other currencies. The euro inched higher to $1.0833, while sterling gained 0.3% and the Japanese yen a similar amount."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, with investors buoyed by news of more stimulus and state reopenings ahead of a week dominated by central bank meetings and earnings from the big tech stocks.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 22 points, or 0.8%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 90 points, or 1%. The Dow futures contract rose 212 points, or 0.9%.
Wall Street is coming off its first losing week in three, and the Dow and S&P 500 cash indices are on track for the best month since October 2011, while the Nasdaq is set for its best month since April 2009.
Earlier Monday the Bank of Japan kicked off a week of central bank action by lifting the cap on its purchases of Japanese government bonds and boosting its purchases of commercial paper and bank loans.
This has raised confidence that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which finishes a two-day meeting on Wednesday, and the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, could offer up more stimulus to support economies hit by social distancing measures.
Elsewhere, more U.S. states are prepared to ease restrictions on commerce this week, despite worries about the extent of testing in place.
""I think as we begin to reopen the economy in May and June you re going to really see the economy bounce back in July, August, September,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday. “We are putting in an unprecedented amount of fiscal relief into the economy.""
The corporate earnings season picks up pace this week, with around 30% of the S&P 500 index scheduled to report financial results in the week ahead.
While Monday is relatively quiet, tech giants Alphabet , Facebook , Twitter , Apple , Microsoft  and Amazon  all report this week. Weak numbers in the first quarter are likely to be a small preview of what’s to come, but most investors will be looking for any guidance further ahead as dire results are already baked in. 
The oil market has slumped Monday, retreating from recent gains as traders fret that production cuts may not be enough to eradicate oversupply.
Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the rig count in the U.S. fell by 60, taking the total number to just 378, and falling quickly towards the lows seen in 2016. In addition, the ongoing oil price slump has ensnared another company as  Diamond Offshore  Drilling  filed for bankruptcy.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude traded 16% lower at $14.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 4% to $23.81.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Broadcom  has offered to scrap its exclusivity deals with TV and modem makers to end an EU antitrust investigation and stave off a possible hefty fine.
Broadcom, which makes chips to power smartphones, computers and networking equipment and is a major supplier to Apple , found itself in EU competition enforcers  crosshairs over its deals with six companies to buy chips exclusively or almost exclusively from it.
That triggered an investigation in June last year and an order to stop such deals until the end of the probe on whether such practices were aimed at squeezing out rivals.
EU regulators have warned that the use of an interim order, the first in almost two decades, could happen more frequently against tech giants due to fast-moving markets.
Broadcom has now pledged not to offer incentives to TV and modem makers to encourage them to acquire more than 50% of their chips and modems from the company for their worldwide or European production.
Competition enforcers typically frown on contentious practices such as tying rebates or other benefits to exclusive or minimum-purchase requirements because these tend to thwart smaller rivals.
Broadcom said its offer addressed the Commission s concerns and it expected the investigation to close before the end of the year.
""In these uncertain times, we welcome the opportunity to avoid protracted litigation and to resolve the investigation without recognition of liability or the imposition of a fine,"" the company said in a statement.
The European Commission said it would now seek feedback before deciding whether to accept the offer which would be valid for five years and without a finding of infringement by the company.
Broadcom defended itself at a closed door hearing in August last year where participants included Intel , MediaTek, Quantenna, a unit of ON Semiconductor and Humax.

It could face a fine of up to 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules. "

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, as negative news surrounding Apple  and General Motors  tempered hopes fanned by the partial easing of lockdown measures in New York and Europe.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 173 points or 0.7% at 23,948 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2%.
Apple  stock lagged the market, rising only 0.1%, after it was reported by the Wall Street Journal to be planning a delay of around one month in bringing this year s flagship iPhone models to market. The WSJ said supply chain disruption and the likelihood of subdued customer demand in the near term were responsible.
Elsewhere, General Motors  stock fell 0.7% after the company suspended its buyback program and quarterly dividend in an effort to preserve liquidity. GM, which like other carmakers is suffering from a steep decline in sales with many dealerships across the country closed, also said it had extended a $3.6 billion revolving credit facility.
Rival Tesla  was up 8.1% at a two-month high after Bloomberg reported that it wants to restart its Fremont factory as early as this week. The facility has been shut for the last few weeks due to California s lockdown measures, and its failure to convince the authorities that it is an ""essential"" operation.
Global stocks were also supported by the Bank of Japan s announcement earlier in the day that it would increase its stimulus efforts, while there is also speculation that the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will both announce fresh support measures at their policy meetings later in the week.
Conditions in the oil market continued to be a drag on stocks in general, however. as the front-month U.S. crude futures contract was crushed by more repositioning from the U.S. Oil ETF .

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc s  discounts on the iPhone 11 in China and the release of a new low-price SE model have put the company in a better position than rivals to weather a coronavirus-related plunge in global smartphone demand.
While China, which accounts for roughly 15% of Apple s revenue, appears to be a rare bright spot, investors will be keen to get a picture of global demand when the Cupertino, California-headquartered company reports second-quarter results on Thursday.
The iPhone maker has shut retail stores in the United States and Europe following the COVID-19 outbreak, and China is the only major market where it has been able to reopen all shops.
Consumer spending is expected to be muted as the pandemic has crippled economies and Apple, the world s second-most valuable tech company, is better armed with the launch of its new price-conscious iPhone model, analysts said.
""Apple is better positioned than most to experience a rapid recovery in a post COVID world,"" Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note. ""We see demand as pushed out, not canceled."" 
He added that the launch of the $399 iPhone SE suggested that Apple s supply chain was getting back on its feet after weeks of shutdown earlier this year. 
Analysts expect Apple to report a 6% drop in revenue and an 11% fall in net income in its fiscal second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
On the other hand, Chinese brands such as Oppo and Vivo who have steadily moved to offer high-end models to challenge iPhones, stand to lose marketshare as bargain hunters choose Apple.
Earlier this month, several online retailers in China slashed prices of the iPhone 11 by as much as 18% - a tactic Apple has used in the past to boost demand. And while initial social media reaction to the new iPhone SE was muted, analysts said they were seeing a pick up in demand.
The cheaper iPhone SE could tempt iPhone owners to opt for a newer device, something they might have otherwise delayed in a weak economy, said Nicole Peng, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Canalys.
""People want to avoid uncertainty in a downturn,"" she said. ""Having a brand like Apple that can showcase quality and make people less worried about breakdowns or after-sales service can bring in buyers.""
CHEAP IS GOOD 
Early data suggests that the Chinese smartphone market is recovering rapidly in the aftermath of the virus, and Apple has emerged relatively unscathed.
Sales of iPhones in China jumped 21% last month from a year earlier and more than three fold from February, government data showed, meaning March-quarter sales in the country were likely to have slipped just 1%.
To be sure, a recovery in Chinese demand won t offset sales lost in the United States and Europe. And the company is yet to launch a smartphone enabled with 5G wireless technology like those offered by Asian rivals, a disadvantage for Apple so far.
But those same expensive 5G models may not sell well in the current climate of frugality, analysts said.
""If there are no massive subsidies (in China), I doubt there will be many smartphone users who will be eager to upgrade to 5G,"" said Linda Sui, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Strategy Analytics.
Sui expects iPhone shipments in 2020 to be down 2 percentage points at the most, versus double digit declines at Chinese firms.
Apple also has revenue from its services business to fall back on. It has leveraged its large iPhone customer base to boost services revenue from music, apps, gaming and video.

""Apple s Services segment should remain resilient in today s work-from-home environment, thereby demonstrating the durability of Apple s model,"" Cowen analyst Krish Sankar said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When law enforcement agencies want to gather evidence locked inside an iPhone, they often turn to hacking software from the Israeli firm Cellebrite. By manually plugging the software into a suspect’s phone, police can break in and determine where the person has gone and whom he or she has met.
Now , as governments fight the spread of COVID-19, Cellebrite is pitching the same capability to help authorities learn who a coronavirus sufferer may have infected. When someone tests positive, authorities can siphon up the patient’s location data and contacts, making it easy to “quarantine the right people,” according to a Cellebrite email pitch to the Delhi police force this month.
This would usually be done with consent, the email said. But in legally justified cases, such as when a patient violates a law against public gatherings, police could use the tools to break into a confiscated device, Cellebrite advised. “We do not need the phone passcode to collect the data,” the salesman wrote to a senior officer in an April 22 email reviewed by Reuters.
A Cellebrite spokeswoman said the salesman was offering the same tools the company has long sold to help police enforce the law. The company is also offering a version of its product line for use by healthcare workers to trace the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, but the tools can only be used with patient consent and can’t hack phones, she said.
Cellebrite’s marketing overtures are part of a wave of efforts by at least eight surveillance and cyber-intelligence companies attempting to sell repurposed spy and law enforcement tools to track the virus and enforce quarantines, according to interviews with executives and non-public company promotional materials reviewed by Reuters.

The executives declined to specify which countries have purchased their surveillance products, citing confidentiality agreements with governments. But executives at four of the companies said they are piloting or in the process of installing products to counter coronavirus in more than a dozen countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. A Delhi police spokesman said the force wasn’t using Cellebrite for coronavirus containment. Reuters is not aware of any purchases by the U.S. government.
So far, Israel is the only country known to be testing a mass surveillance system pitched by the companies, asking NSO Group, one of the industry’s biggest players, to help build its platform. But the rollout of NSO’s surveillance project with the Israeli Ministry of Defense is on hold pending legal challenges related to privacy issues, an NSO executive said. A spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said NSO was involved in the project but did not provide further details.
Surveillance-tech companies have flourished in recent years as law enforcement and spy agencies around the world have sought new methods for countering adversaries who now often communicate through encrypted mobile apps. The firms argue that their experience helping governments track shadowy networks of militants makes them uniquely qualified to uncover the silent spread of a novel disease.
“I really believe this industry is doing more good than bad,” said Tal Dilian, a former Israeli intelligence officer and now a co-chief executive officer of Cyprus-based Intellexa, a cyber-surveillance firm that works with intelligence agencies in Southeast Asia and Europe. “Now is a good time to show that to the world.”
Yet some technologists remain skeptical that spying tools reliant on phone location data can be used to effectively combat a virus.
“It’s not precise enough, that’s the point. It’s not nearly going to get you down to whether you re next to a certain person or not,” said Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London.
While the methods for location tracking and accuracy vary, surveillance companies say they can narrow down a person’s coordinates to within three feet, depending on conditions.
PRIVACY RIGHTS VS. HEALTH CONCERNS
Privacy issues loom. Civil liberties advocates fear that virus tracking efforts could open the door to the kind of ubiquitous government surveillance efforts they have fought for decades. Some are alarmed by the potential role of spyware firms, arguing their involvement could undermine the public trust governments need to restrain the spread of the virus.
""This public health crisis needs a public health solution - not the interjection of for-profit surveillance companies looking to exploit this crisis,” said Edin Omanovic, advocacy director for the UK-based civil liberties group Privacy International.
Claudio Guarnieri, a technologist with the human rights organization Amnesty International, said any new surveillance powers embraced by states to combat the virus should be met with “high scrutiny.”
“New systems of control, from location tracking to contact tracing, all raise different concerns on necessity and proportionality,” said Guarnieri.
Cellebrite, for one, said it requires “agencies that use our solutions to uphold the standards of international human rights law.”
Government officials have sought to address such concerns by pointing to the unprecedented nature of the crisis. COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has so far infected more than 3 million people worldwide, killing over 210,000.
In South Africa, for example, after the government last month announced it would use telecom data to track the movements of citizens infected with COVID-19, a communications minister acknowledged concerns about loss of privacy.
“We do respect that everyone has a right to privacy, but in a situation like this our individual rights do not supersede the country’s rights,” Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, the communications minister, said at a press conference for South Africa’s COVID-19 command council this month.
The South African Health Ministry declined to comment on details of the program and whether it had contracted with any of the intelligence firms.
A number of countries are developing and deploying COVID-19 contact-tracing apps that do not rely on location data. Instead, these apps, already in use in Singapore, India and Colombia, tap the smartphone connectivity technology Bluetooth to sense and record when other devices are nearby. When someone tests positive for coronavirus, typically, everyone that person made contact with is notified.
Christophe Fraser, an epidemiologist at Oxford University’s Big Data Institute, said this approach, if implemented properly, could save lives and shorten lockdowns. “The idea is to try and maximize social distancing practices of those at risk of infection and minimize the impact on all the other people,” he said.
This app-based approach to contact tracing is considered, by its advocates, as more privacy friendly because people voluntarily download the app and sensitive personal data are visible only to health authorities. This method of containing the disease is the focus of a rare collaboration between Apple Inc  and Alphabet  Inc’s Google to quickly deploy the Bluetooth-based technology for use in the United States and elsewhere. But the approach relies on widespread adoption of the apps, and its accuracy remains unproven.
Apple says its plan is designed to “help amplify the efforts of the public health authorities” and that “many factors will help flatten [infection] curves — no one believes this is the only one.” A Google spokesman referred to a prior statement, which said “each user will have to make an explicit choice to turn on the technology.”
By contrast, deploying a mass surveillance platform like Intellexa’s means everyone would be under collection right away; no one needs to opt in, nor could anyone opt out. Such a setup can be done remotely in a matter of weeks, said an executive at NSO Group, which is also offering its wares to fight the coronavirus.
PUBLIC HEALTH SPY  TECH
The surging spyware business is estimated by research firm MarketsandMarkets to be worth $3.6 billion this year.
But the industry has been dogged by legal and ethical concerns. Human rights groups have accused some companies of helping undemocratic governments target dissidents and activists. The companies say they help governments prevent terrorism and capture criminals.
Last year, for example, Facebook’s WhatsApp unit accused NSO Group of helping governments hack 1,400 targets that included activists, journalists, diplomats and state officials. NSO denies the allegations, saying it only provides the technology to government agencies under strict controls and is not involved in operations.
Intellexa’s Dilian fled Cyprus last year after an arrest warrant was issued for him, on accusations that he used a surveillance van to illegally intercept communications in the country. Dilian denies the allegations, returned to Cyprus last month and said he is cooperating with authorities. A Cypriot police spokesman told Reuters the investigation is active.
Now, industry executives, investors and analysts say the coronavirus crisis offers intelligence firms the possibility of billions of dollars in business, while burnishing their reputations.
India is among the courted countries. In April, New York-based  Verint Systems   asked Indian officials to pay $5 million for a year’s subscription to a host of services designed to track and surveil people with coronavirus. Those included a cellphone tower geolocation platform and a program to monitor social media activity, according to documents seen by Reuters and a person with knowledge of the negotiations. No sale has yet been agreed in India, the source said.
A Verint spokesman declined to answer questions, instead referring to an April 16 press release which said unspecified products were being used by an unnamed country to help respond to COVID-19. India’s Ministry of Interior said it had not purchased a system from Verint.
NSO Group and Intellexa are also both pitching COVID-19 tracking platforms to countries across Asia, Latin America and Europe. Their technology could allow a government to track the movement of nearly every person in the country who carries a cellphone, sucking up a continuous trove of location data. Installed within telecom providers, the technology functions through the analysis of call records, said NSO and Intellexa executives.
When a person tests positive, the systems would allow authorities to input the result, tracking those who made contact with the patient in the past few weeks. Those exposed would receive a text message encouraging them to get tested or self-isolate. NSO said the system’s administrators would not see the identity of individuals.
Revelations in 2013 that the U.S. National Security Agency had collected this kind of mobile phone data about Americans to track national security threats created a storm of controversy and fueled new restrictions on surveillance.
Suzanne Spaulding, a former U.S. intelligence community lawyer and senior Homeland Security official, described this potential COVID-19 tracking approach as “among the most privacy-invasive.” That’s because it “envisions all of the data about everyone s movements, not just infected individuals and their known contacts, going to the government.”
South Korea, Pakistan, Ecuador and South Africa have all indicated in public statements they were rolling out contact tracing systems using telecom data to track infected citizens, though the details haven’t been released.
South Korean officials say any loss of privacy from surveillance must be weighed against the disastrous economic consequences caused from a long-term shutdown.
“It is also a restriction of freedom when you ban free movement of people in crisis,” Jung Seung-soo, a deputy director at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, told Reuters. The country is not using outside surveillance vendors, the official said.
Intellexa is in the process of installing its system in two Western European countries, Dilian said. He declined to name them.
In an interview with Reuters, NSO employees responsible for the product said the company is piloting the approach in 10 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, but declined to name them.
Three other Israeli companies, Rayzone Group, Cobwebs Technologies and Patternz, are offering countries coronavirus tracking capabilities. These largely rely on location data gathered from mobile advertising platforms, according to company promotional documents reviewed by Reuters and people familiar with the companies.
Rayzone Group declined to comment. Requests for comment to Patternz went unanswered. Omri Timianker, president and co-founder of Cobwebs Technologies, said his company is working with five governments to help track the spread of the virus, but declined to identify them.
While some experts say advertising data isn’t precise enough to combat the spread of COVID-19, the documents reviewed by Reuters suggest the three firms are marketing technology which they contend can ingest and process advertising data into a form that’s useful for narrowly tracking individuals.

Intellexa’s Dilian said his company’s platform will cost between $9 million and $16 million for countries with large populations. He believes COVID-19 tracking will be just the beginning. Once the pandemic ends, he hopes countries that invested in his mass surveillance tool will adapt it for espionage and security. “We want to enable them to upgrade,” he said."

In an interview with Reuters, NSO employees responsible for the product said the company is piloting the approach in 10 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, but declined to name them.
Three other Israeli companies, Rayzone Group, Cobwebs Technologies and Patternz, are offering countries coronavirus tracking capabilities. These largely rely on location data gathered from mobile advertising platforms, according to company promotional documents reviewed by Reuters and people familiar with the companies.
Rayzone Group declined to comment. Requests for comment to Patternz went unanswered. Omri Timianker, president and co-founder of Cobwebs Technologies, said his company is working with five governments to help track the spread of the virus, but declined to identify them.
While some experts say advertising data isn’t precise enough to combat the spread of COVID-19, the documents reviewed by Reuters suggest the three firms are marketing technology which they contend can ingest and process advertising data into a form that’s useful for narrowly tracking individuals.

Intellexa’s Dilian said his company’s platform will cost between $9 million and $16 million for countries with large populations. He believes COVID-19 tracking will be just the beginning. Once the pandemic ends, he hopes countries that invested in his mass surveillance tool will adapt it for espionage and security. “We want to enable them to upgrade,” he said."

Lawmakers from the ruling party of President Emmanuel Macron had accused their own government on Monday of withdrawing a vote on the app initially slated for Tuesday, saying they had been robbed of a chance to raise privacy concerns.
But Philippe said it was too early to discuss the project -- dubbed ""StopCovid"" -- because it was not clear whether it would actually work. 
""For the moment, considering the uncertainty surrounding this application, I would be hard-pressed to tell you if it works, and how it would work exactly,"" Philippe told lawmakers in a wide-ranging speech on how he planned to lift France s virtual lockdown.
Philippe said he agreed that the project raised legitimate questions about civil liberties, adding that the speaker of the lower house had also expressed to him reservations about the app. 
""These issues, I already had opportunities to say it, seem legitimate. They must be raised. They must be debated. I even think they should be voted on,"" Philippe said, without giving a new date for the debate.
France has so far stuck to a  centralised  approach to smartphone contact tracing, which it had developed with Germany, which would have required the personal data of volunteers  Bluetooth logs to be stored on a server.

Germany changed course on Sunday, opting for a de-centralised approach advocated by Apple  and Google  that instead involves the storing of the data on devices."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Josh Hawley urged the Justice Department on Tuesday to open a criminal probe of Amazon.com Inc , saying the online retailer was building a monopoly using ""predatory data practices"" on vendors using its platform.
Hawley, a Republican who has been critical of big tech platforms like Alphabet  s Google, expressed concern about a report in the Wall Street Journal that Amazon collects data about products sold by third parties on its site in order to create Amazon branded copies, saying it went far beyond what brick and mortar stores are able to do.
""I write to ask you to open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon. Recent reports suggest that Amazon has engaged in predatory and exclusionary data practices to build and maintain a monopoly,"" Hawley wrote in a letter to Attorney General William Barr that was dated Tuesday.
The big four tech platforms -- Google, Apple , Amazon and Facebook  -- are under investigation by the House Judiciary Committee and Justice Department while the Federal Trade Commission is probing Facebook and Amazon. Meanwhile, groups of state attorneys general are looking at Facebook and Google.
Hawley noted that the practice was ""especially concerning"" given that many small retailers have been forced to temporarily shutter their stores and have become more reliant on online sales because of public health measures ordered to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
Amazon said in a statement that it ""strictly prohibit(s) employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch.""
""While we don t believe these claims made by the Wall Street Journal are accurate, we take these allegations very seriously and have launched an internal investigation,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in an email statement.

A Justice Department spokesman said that it had received the letter and was reviewing it."

Investing.com – The Dow erased some of its gains on Tuesday, paced by a decline in health care and tech stocks as investors weighed up the earnings from corporates against efforts to reopen the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.48%, or 112 points, but had gained as many as 378 points at session highs. The S&P 500 added 0.33%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.40%.
With the majority of FAANG names set to report this week, investors piled out of large-cap tech stocks, forcing the broader market to cut its gains.
Google-parent Alphabet , which reports after the close today, slipped 1.9%, Facebook , which reports quarterly results tomorrow, fell 1.5%, Amazon.com  and Apple , both of which report results Thursday, fell 1.7% and 0.7% respectively.
On the earnings front, corporates delivered mixed results.
Drug maker Merck  fell 3% to pressure the broader health-care sector after pulling its guidance for the year and warning that most of the negative impact from Covid-19 will be seen in the second quarter. But the company did beat earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter.
In industrials, investors had to contend with mixed earnings as 3M beat estimates, but  Caterpillar  missed.
Caterpillar  rose 0.5% despite missing expectations on both the top and bottom lines following a coronavirus-led impact to construction and mining demand.
3M  reported better-than-expected revenue as higher demand in personal safety equipment sales boosted performance, sending its share price more than 2.5% higher.
Elsewhere, retailers caught a bid even as economic data flagged weakness in the consumer, the backbone of the economy.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Federal appeals court judges asked prosecutors on Tuesday why a lower court could seal a ruling that absolved Facebook  from having to wiretap a criminal suspect using one of the company’s encrypted services.
All three members of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reviewing the matter had tough questions for the U.S. Justice Department’s support for secrecy in a rare higher-court examination of the government s power to compel technical assistance.
The hour-long oral arguments came in an attempt by the American Civil Liberties Union to force into view at least the legal reasoning from the lower judge who declined to hold Facebook in contempt of court.
Although almost all of that case has been hidden from view, Reuters reported in 2018 that it turned on whether the Wiretap Act, which requires phone companies to help police listen to calls, could also be used to make Facebook break the end-to-end encryption that protects voice calls placed over Facebook Messenger. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-encryption-exclusive-idUSKCN1M82K1]
In the current case, a judge in the Eastern District of California accepted prosecutors’ contention that the public did not have a right to know why Facebook prevailed on the contempt motion because it grew out of a wiretap request. Applications for those are typically sealed.
The judge also found that even though the suspects had been charged, releasing the ruling could hurt future investigations by revealing government capabilities. 
Meeting by video-conference, the appeals judges asked Justice official Scott Meisler in Washington why the public should not be able to see the order, especially if technical aspects were redacted.
“To the extent legal analysis does not implicate the details of the government investigation... I have some trouble understanding why that shouldn’t be made public,” appeals Judge Margaret McKeown told Meisler.
Judge Jacqueline Nguyen said she agreed that the public interest was ”fairly substantial.”
Internet companies are treated differently than phone companies under the law, though Justice Department leaders and some members of Congress have been pushing for new laws restricting strong encryption.
Other fights have been occurring in closed courts and occasionally in the open, as when the FBI failed in 2016 to force Apple  to break into an iPhone used by a slain San Bernardino, California, terrorist. Despite the pressure, Facebook has been moving to encrypt more of its offerings.
ACLU attorney Jennifer Granick told the appellate judges that they would be the first in the country to approve sealing an opinion in a criminal matter and that they would be hurting the public’s ability to see how the law of great interest is being applied.
“The sealed opinion may purport to define how far the government can push third parties to facilitate government surveillance of networks the public understands and relies on to be secure,” the ACLU wrote in a brief with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Stanford cryptography policy expert Riana Pfefferkorn.
“Other technology companies have a right to know the law in this area, to inform their own practices in responding to law enforcement requests,"" it added. 

While maintaining that the lower judge’s reasoning was inextricably interwoven with sensitive facts, the Justice Department s Meisler repeatedly asked that if the appellate panel disagreed, it should at least order redactions. "

Investing.com – The Dow swung between losses and gains to end Tuesday in negative territory as investors weighed up mixed earnings and further signs of weakness in the economy as consumer confidence plunged.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.13%, or about 32 points, but had gained as many as 378 points at session highs. The S&P 500 fell about 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.4%.
The earnings season continued to serve up mixed earnings and reflect the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on quarterly performance.
Merck  fell after the drugmaker pulled its guidance and warned of a $2.1 billion hit to full-year sales from the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed about 57,000 nationwide and infected more than 1 million.
The gloomy outlook offset quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines.
In industrials,  Caterpillar   missed consensus estimates following a coronavirus-led impact to construction and mining demand. 3M , meanwhile, said its earnings received a boost from a coronavirus-led jump in demand in personal safety equipment sales.
The mixed backdrop of earnings arrived ahead of a big week for large-cap tech stocks, with the majority of FAANG names set to report this week.
Google-parent Alphabet , which reports after the close today, slipped about 3%, Facebook , Amazon.com  and Apple , all of which report over the coming days, were all lower.
Retailers, meanwhile, caught a bid despite signs of weakness in the consumer, as investors seemingly bet the worst of the pandemic may be over as the U.S. gets its partial economic restart underway.

Small-caps, cheap stocks and cyclical plays are all on firmer footing this week, ignoring the dire economic and earnings data that’s only getting worse in the background. Their strength has pushed the market to another milestone: More than half the S&P 500’s members are trading above their 50-day moving average for the first time since late February, a swift rebound from the low single-digits just a month ago.
The S&P 500 is in the midst of an astonishing run, with stocks posting one of the fastest recoveries on record over the past few weeks. Partly, it’s a response to improving coronavirus trends and the loosening of shelter-in-place decrees. To others, though, it’s a continued reaction to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary measures that are helping thrust equities higher despite deteriorating data and severe dysfunction in the commodities markets.
“Asset prices aren’t just reacting to economic recovery -- they’re more willing to react to stimulus measures,” said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone. “And you have a flood of stimulus in this market.”
The Federal Reserve and Congress have announced a deluge of measures aimed at shoring up the U.S. economy and easing dislocations in credit markets. The alphabet soup of facilities set up to buy troubled assets or loan to cash-strapped companies seemingly grows by the week. On Monday, for instance, the central bank expanded its municipal-debt program to cover smaller cities and counties. More is likely to come from Congress, too, as legislators start to work on the next phase of aid.
The Fed’s balance sheet has already ballooned to a record $6.57 trillion as the central bank continues its robust purchases. It could reach as much as $12 trillion and top 50% of gross domestic product by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg Economics. The balance sheet troughed at 18% of GDP in 2019.
To Tony Dwyer at Canaccord Genuity, the Fed’s actions have been “game-changing.” When the central bank announced a fresh stimulus package in early April, he and his team took the worst-case scenario off the table.
“It wasn’t the amount of money that was important (although that is incredible), it was the fact that as soon as the Fed saw an area of stress, it attacked it with an incredible amount of money,” Dwyer wrote in a note. “It is clear the Fed and Congress are just going to keep providing money until it works.”
Though consumer confidence and retail sentiment have fallen sharply in recent weeks, some readings are still above the record lows reached during the 2008-2009 and 1990 crises and may not drop to those same levels again, according to Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  .
“With the stimulus so large and directed right at the consumer and small businesses, we may be surprised at how well the consumer fares in what is amounting to the steepest decline in economic activity in history,” he wrote in a recent note.
Earlier: Nothing Is Certain But Bailouts: How Stimulus Works in a Vacuum
All that largess continues to push up stocks, which have already retraced about half their virus-induced losses. While the advance was for a while confined to a handful of defensive names and the mega-cap tech firms that led the bulk of the recovery, the makeup of those benefiting has started to shift in recent days. Small-cap stocks bested their larger peers for the second day Tuesday, with the gap between the two at its widest in about a decade.
It’s also meant a changing of the guard among market leaders.
More economically-sensitive S&P 500 sectors, including financials, materials and industrials are among the leaders this week. And the equal-weighted version of the gauge rose as much as 2.8% Tuesday while the market-cap weighted index declined. Some of the largest tech stocks, including Apple Inc ., Alphabet  Inc.,  Microsoft Corp  . and Amazon.com Inc . are lagging this week, with the latter two among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 Tuesday.
Of course, not everyone is convinced that the recent rally is justified.
To Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark, stocks have become overly optimistic. “The economic policy is winning the battle for the hearts and minds of the market but not the arms and legs of the economy,” he said in an interview. “That’s what I think is the disconnect.”"
662,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/samsung-warns-of-profit-slide-after-virus-slams-tech-sphere-2154156,2020-04-29,Samsung Warns of Profit Slide After Virus Slams Tech Sphere By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics  Co. warned earnings may decline this quarter after the coronavirus outbreak hurt demand for its smartphones and gadgets, trimming income gained from surging server-chip orders.
South Korea’s largest company reported a 4% slide in net income to 4.9 trillion won ($4 billion) in the three months ended March. Samsung (KS:005930), which had reported better-than-expected operating profits earlier this month, said the pandemic continued to hammer demand across an array of markets.
The warning from the world’s largest maker of memory chips, smartphones and consumer appliances underscores the uncertainty gripping global industry. As the pandemic spread in the first months of the year, the technology sector took hits from both supply and demand. Samsung joins peers such as  Intel Corp  . in cautioning about the impact of a global economic slowdown.
Samsung “expects the memory business to remain solid, but overall earnings are likely to decline from the previous quarter because COVID-19 will significantly impact demand for several of its core products,” it said in a statement. “In the second half, uncertainties driven by COVID-19 will persist as the duration and impact of the pandemic remain unknown.”

In particular, Samsung said a drop in smartphone earnings is “inevitable” in the second quarter because of store closings and other factors, while profits would also slip in mobile displays. Executives on a post-earnings conference call refrained from offering guidance on the memory market but said the company will continue to invest in semiconductor expansions and research.
The Covid-19 pandemic has emerged as one of the largest economic shocks in recent years, disrupting both consumer demand as well as supply chains worldwide. Factories in countries such as China were temporarily shut, crimping orders for Samsung components like displays. Meanwhile, retail stores, including those of client Apple Inc ., were closed to avoid spreading infections. That’s been offset in part by demand for the memory chips used in datacenters and computers, which allow people to work and study from home. Samsung’s shares stood largely unchanged Wednesday.

In contrast to a sequential as well as year-on-year increase, according to Bloomberg consensus, Samsung expects 2Q earnings may decline. We expect its memory chip profit will stay sturdy in 2Q since most contracts should have been concluded with customers.

Should the pandemic persist into the second half, the tech giant foresees missing its own 2020 revenue projections by a double-digit percentage, Bloomberg News has reported. A prolonged virus outbreak may also disrupt its supply chain.
Predicting the outlook is difficult due to Covid-19 in the U.S. and Europe, said Samsung Securities analyst Hwang Min-seong. “But the good news is that China is showing signs of a fast recovery,” he said. “Still, there are concerns over whether chip demand will be sustainable in the second half despite improved sentiment on server demand.”
SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc ., which control the bulk of the memory chip market together with Samsung, have told investors that strong demand from data-center clients boosted sales and profits and that the trend is expected to continue in the first half.

Chip companies have projected that the contract prices for DRAM and NAND will remain solid throughout the second quarter. In addition to server expansions, the pandemic is seen as a catalyst for expediting the transition to 5G and autonomous or touchless technology, driving component sales.
Apple and Huawei Technologies Co. supplier Hynix said there was a possibility that even server demand could lose steam if the economic downturn is prolonged. Intel withdrew its full-year sales forecast last week for the year, citing “significant” uncertainty.
“Demand for server and PC to remain solid as more people work from home, but a decline in mobile demand to remain a risk,” Samsung said Wednesday in an earnings presentation.
Sluggish sales of Samsung’s flagship S20 lineup will be reflected in the current quarter, eroding profitability at the smartphone division, which has been reeling from plant and store shutdowns in some regions.
Its display business had a 290 billion won operating loss after smartphone sales from Apple and Huawei sharply fell in the first quarter. The consumer electronics unit, which includes TVs and appliances, reported operating profit of 450 billion won. Samsung’s major overseas appliances plants temporarily shut from March through early April.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics  Co Ltd said on Wednesday it expected profit to decline in the current quarter due to a coronavirus-related slump in sales of smartphones and TVs, although the chip business would remain solid. 
The South Korean conglomerate joined other tech giants such as SK Hynix and Intel  in declining to provide annual forecasts because of the uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic.
It said that while work-from-home orders and the related growth in online learning would underpin demand for memory chips, the outlook for smartphones and TVs was bleak as consumers put off discretionary spending.
""Even as such uncertainties persist, overall conditions in the memory industry are likely to be favorable due to server and PC demand,"" Han Jin-man, senior vice president at Samsung (KS:005930) s chip business, said during a conference call.
In contrast, Samsung said it expected its mobile and TV profits to ""decline significantly"" in the second quarter as consumers reined in spending on non-essentials and stores and factories are closed due to the outbreak. 
The world s top maker of memory chips and smartphones reported operating profit rose 3% to 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) in the first quarter, fueled by solid chip demand and reduced marketing spending on phones. 
Samsung Electronics shares fell 0.3% after the results on Wednesday, while the wider market was up 0.6%. 
""Earnings will deteriorate in earnest for mobile phones, home appliances and TVs, which are weighing on stocks,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment and Securities.
Other chipmakers SK Hynix and Intel last week posted forecast-beating first-quarter earnings, but did not provide full-year forecasts. 
Samsung s chip business posted first-quarter operating profit of 3.99 trillion won, down 3% from a year earlier. 
Some customers were also restocking chips because of concerns about supply disruptions due to the pandemic, boosting chip earnings, it said.
The mobile division posted operating profit 2.65 trillion won, up 17% from a year earlier. 
Samsung said that while mobile shipments fell from the previous quarter, profitability improved with 5G and other premium models making up a greater portion of sales. 
Its display business nearly halved its loss to 290 billion won from a year earlier despite slumping phone sales in China, thanks to a rebound in TV panel prices due to supply disruptions.
In March Samsung said it would end production of mainstay LCD panels in China and Korea by the end of 2020, due to oversupply stemming from expansion by Chinese companies. 

Samsung is a diversified tech giant, making phones, TVs and home appliances, and components like chips and displays used in consumer electronics. Samsung counts Apple Inc  and Huawei as both competitors and customers."

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares eked out slim gains on Wednesday, with optimism over economies easing coronavirus lockdowns and oil prices clawing back ground leavened by caution over corporate earnings.
MSCI  world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, ticked up 0.2%, with European shares mirroring a buoyant day in Asia after initially choppy trading.
The broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 0.1%, with German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)  saying it expected a full-year profit even after a plunge in first-quarter earnings and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) also eyeing an operating profit for its Mercedes-Benz Cars  & Vans unit. Still, major drugmakers Roche  and  Novartis   weighed on the market, falling 2% and 0.7% respectively.
Markets in Frankfurt (GDAXI) and Paris (FCHI) both gained 0.3%, with London (FTSE) adding 1%. 
Risk assets including equities have rallied for most of this month thanks to heavy doses of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus around the globe aimed at softening the economic blow from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Still, Europe s quarterly results continue to deteriorate, with Refinitiv data pointing to a 40.4% decline in earnings for companies listed on the STOXX 600, versus 37% a week ago.
Investors across the world are growing confident the pandemic may be peaking as parts of the United States, Europe and Australia gradually ease restrictions. 
New Zealand this week allowed some businesses to reopen. 
""The market is broadly buying stocks on the hope of the recovery and focusing on the eventual winners of this part of the cycle related to COVID-19, and then the structural winners,"" said Sebastien Galy, a strategist at Nordea. 
Positive news around potential treatments for the infection as well as progress in developing a vaccine have also boosted sentiment. 
Earlier, MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained 1% to a near two-month peak. Wall Street futures (ESc1) were up 0.7%, helped by forecast-beating revenues from Alphabet Inc s Google .
CRUDE COMES BACK 
Hopes the moves would help revive demand sent U.S. crude futures (CLc1) up about 15% to $14.12 a barrel, paring a 27% plunge over the first two days of this week. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) futures rose 5% to $21.47 a barrel.
The moves also emboldened bets on riskier currencies, keeping the dollar on the back foot, with the greenback falling 0.3% to 99.610 against a basket of currencies (=USD).
The euro (EUR=) was flat at $1.0860 though the euro index (=EUR) eased after Fitch cut Italy s credit rating to BBB-, just one notch above ""junk"" status. Italy s government bond yields rose after the cut.
Some analysts were circumspect about the rally in stocks, noting a concentration among tech and IT stocks.
""We were actually seeing a big dislocation in performance in the new world - the tech thing - and the old economy of industrials reliant on human costs,"" said Olivier Marciot, portfolio manager at Unigestion. 
Investors are now watching out for results from the other major tech firms including Amazon  and Apple . Earnings from Facebook  and  Microsoft Corp   are due later in the day.
The gains have come even as analysts predict a sharp contraction in world growth. 
Moody s  expects economies of the group of 20 advanced nations (G20) to shrink 5.8% this year with momentum unlikely to recover to pre-coronavirus levels even in 2021. 
Markets were next looking for any guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is due to issue a policy statement around 1800 GMT after its two-day meeting. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - When the coronavirus outbreak in China disrupted global smartphone production in February, Samsung (KS:005930) looked set to weather the crisis better than most thanks to its limited exposure there and launches of pricey 5G phones. Its fortunes are reversing.
The world s biggest smartphone vendor, Samsung Electronics  Co in full, warned on Wednesday of a significant drop in mobile earnings in the second quarter, as recession fears dampen demand for high-end models and carriers in major markets delay the rollouts of fast 5G networks.
The COVID-19 pandemic is hitting all vendors hard. But Samsung s strategy of focusing on 5G in advanced markets like Europe and the United States - it captured nearly three-quarters of global 5G phone sales last year - plus dwindling market share in some emerging markets could put it in a deeper quagmire.
By contrast, American arch-rival Apple Inc  now looks better positioned as China, which accounts for roughly 15% of its revenues has reopened shops.
By contrast, the reopening has had limited upside for Samsung as the country accounts for a small fraction of its business; it does not break out China revenue, but it accounts for less than 1% of its phone shipments.
Apple, whose lack of a 5G model has been seen as a key disadvantage versus Samsung, has also launched a new budget iPhone SE model that many analysts predict will prove popular among consumers in a recession.
The California-based tech giant reports quarterly results on Thursday.
SECOND QUARTER
Samsung s total smartphone shipments fell by 18% in the first quarter from a year earlier. But a higher proportion of premium and 5G phone shipments, as well as lower marketing costs, helped profits rise 17% at its mobile division, which includes phones and mobile network equipment.
Profits were resilient in first quarter when the industry impact from COVID-19 was largely down to the outbreak in China, analysts said. However the company faces deep pain in the second quarter which will show the hit to its business from the spread of the virus in Europe and the United States, its strongholds for premium phones, they added.
""The problem is Samsung s mobile business will be really bad,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. ""It will recover in the second half, but not as strongly as Apple.""
Lee Jong-min, a Samsung vice president, touched on the difficulties on Wednesday.
""Although there are signs that the spread of the coronavirus in North America and Europe is slowing down, it is too soon to be relieved,"" he told analysts. ""Also, as it takes some time for the economy to recover, it is difficult to forecast how much of a demand drop we will see in the second quarter.""
 HEARTBREAKING 
Samsung said the deployment of 5G networks were being delayed in India, the United States and Europe because of lockdown measures there.
In China, it expects a boost in 5G spending due to government stimulus measures, but analysts say the policies will benefit local rivals such as Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and Xiaomi  Corp more.
In India, where smartphone shipments jumped 12% in the first quarter despite the impact of a nationwide lockdown in the final week of March, Samsung further ceded market share, becoming No.3 vendor after China s Xiaomi and Vivo.
Samsung is set to face further competition in those two markets, not just from Chinese rivals but also Apple, which launched lower-priced $399 SE model this month.
Samsung s CEO Koh Dong-jin said in late March that it aimed to reclaim its No.1 position in India by offering a wider range of models. The company also plans to boost sales of premium models in China, he added, describing its sluggish sales there as ""heartbreaking"".
Samsung said on Wednesday it would also boost offerings of mid and lower-end 5G models globally, while launching new premium models as scheduled in the second half of the year, including the Note and a foldable phone.
Some analysts are nonetheless worried about the company s prospects this year.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Shares in sensor producer AMS jumped 22% after the Apple  supplier gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter and the remainder of the year, soothing investors who fear a slump in smartphone demand due to the coronavirus crisis.
AMS, which is in the process of taking over the leading car headlight producer Osram to diversify into the auto business, said demand from smartphone makers continued to be strong despite the pandemic. 
It forecast a profit (EBIT) margin of 17-20% on revenue of $440-480 million for the second quarter after reaching $501 million in revenue and a margin of 20% in the January-March period. 
""The second-quarter guidance is much better than expected,"" said  Credit Suisse   analysts. However, the auto and industrial business will likely see a stronger negative impact in the second quarter due to COVID-19, they added. 
The gains in the Swiss-listed company s shares erased part of their 60% drop this year amid investor worries about demand from its main customer Apple, weak auto trends at Osram and high levels of debt. 
AMS is in constant discussions with all its customers to ensure that its guidance is as accurate as possible, said Chief Executive Alexander Everke in a call. 
Asked about the remainder of the year, he said it was ""likely that we see a general seasonal pattern with a higher second half like in other years"". He had the impression that smartphone makers continued their development, design and other preparation activities despite the economic damages caused by the coronavirus.
AMS s upbeat outlook echoed comments from Asian tech firms including Huawei [HWT.UL] and Foxconn.
However, Samsung Electronics  said on Wednesday it expected profit to decline in the current quarter due to a coronavirus-related slump in sales of smartphones and TVs, although the chip business would remain solid. 
OSRAM BUY ON TRACK
The Osram acquisition was fully on track, AMS said. 
The company plans to pay for the Osram shares tendered under its takeover offer largely with the proceeds of its 1.75 billion Swiss franc (1.66 billion euros) capital increase, its finance chief said.
The 4.4 billion euros bridge loan for the takeover, provided by UBS, HSBC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch , will be refinanced through a combination of different debt instruments, Michael Wachsler-Markowitsch said. However, up until now AMS only pulled down around 450 million and therefore was in no rush to tap the market. 
The Osram deal will be the largest purchase in AMS s history. In the 1990s, the group had miscalculated with two acquisitions in Germany and South Africa and had to sell the businesses later at a loss.
Osram withdrew its 2020 guidance in March, saying the pandemic would affect demand in its semiconductor and automotive divisions, which account for more than half its sales. 
Osram will report second-quarter results on May 7.

(Reuters) - Arm Inc, the British firm whose chip technologies power most smart phones, said on Wednesday it was easing fees for startup companies and providing free offerings to an incubator for early-stage chip firms.
Arm, owned by Japan’s Softbank  Group Corp, licenses its intellectual property to companies like Qualcomm  Inc, Apple Inc  and Samsung Electronics  Co Ltd, which in turn use the technology in their respective chips for smartphones and other devices. Arm charges a range of licensing fees to access its technology, including some that must be paid for potentially several years of design and development time before a company ever sees its first physical chip.
Those costs are more difficult for small companies to absorb, so last year Arm opened up about three-quarters of its portfolio of chip technology for a new ""flexible access"" program that delayed many of those fees until after its customers had a chip in hand that they could begin to sell. Arm also faces competition from RISC-V, an open-source chip technology with fewer licensing costs.
On Wednesday, Arm extended that effort, saying it would eliminate its annual access fees for startups with less than $5 million in funding.
An Arm spokesman said the program will carry some costs to Arm, but the company views it as a long-term investment to ensure smaller chip companies can become familiar with its technology.
Arm also on Wednesday joined Silicon Catalyst, a California-based firm that provides support to small chip firms, as an ""in-kind partner"" by providing some of its offerings for free to the firm s portfolio companies.
Silicon Catalyst has persuaded many of the highest-cost suppliers of software and intellectual property for designing chips to donate to its companies to defray millions of dollars of development costs before physical chips roll off a manufacturing line.
Pete Rodriguez, a former  NXP Semiconductors   executive who is now Silicon Catalyst s chief executive, told Reuters that having free access to some of Arm s intellectual property will help the firm s portfolio companies survive long enough to get to the point of manufacturing physical chips, raise additional rounds of funding and eventually begin paying for Arm s technology.
""It’s really hard to raise money for hardware – and it’s even harder to do it with just a PowerPoint presentation,” Rodriguez said. ""We don t give our in-kind partners anything other than a healthy customer."""

(Reuters) -  Spotify Technology  SA s  paid music subscribers surged to 130 million in the first quarter, driving shares in the Swedish music streaming firm higher as its business model proved more resilient than expected in the coronavirus lockdowns.
A double-digit rise in quarterly revenue helped the company weather a virus-related decline in ad sales, which contributed less than 10% to overall revenue.
But Spotify, which earns by a mixture of subscriptions and showing ads to non-paying users, continued to solidify its commercial lead in streaming over Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc .
""Despite all the turbulence around the world, we hit pretty much all the metrics,"" Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek told Reuters.
The company said it started seeing a fall in users in late February in virus-affected countries such as Italy and Spain, but has seen meaningful recovery in the last few weeks. 
Ek credited the company s more than 300 partnerships with device makers and its expansion into podcasts as a few reasons for its continued appeal to an audience now trapped at home.
""Work from home appears to be increasing streaming services in general, so we don t see users choosing between Netflix  and Spotify,"" Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross said.
While usage on mobile devices and in cars dropped in the last few weeks of March, usage on video game consoles such as  Microsoft Corp  s  Xbox and Sony Corp s (T:6758) PlayStation surged during the first quarter.
Overall, monthly active users, a key metric, rose 31% in the quarter, in line with Spotify s forecast.
Spotify s subscriber and user metrics proved resilient, while the ad business was challenged, which is less of a focus, Evercore analyst Kevin Rippey said. 
For the second quarter, Spotify expects premium subscribers in the range of 133 million to 138 million. Analysts were expecting 136.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It forecast total revenue in the range of 1.75 billion euros ($1.90 billion) to 1.95 billion euros, below expectation of 2.02 billion euros.
First-quarter premium subscribers rose 31% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 128.6 million. 
Revenue rose 22% to 1.85 billion euros, but missed the average analyst estimate of 1.86 billion euros.
For 2020, Spotify reduced its revenue target to 7.65 billion to 8.05 billion euros from 8.08 billion to 8.48 billion euros due to changes to foreign exchange rates and a lower ad sales expectations.

Shares of Spotify rose 10% to $153.19 in trading before the bell on the New York Stock Exchange."

The two Silicon Valley companies, whose operating systems power 99% of the world s smartphones, had said earlier this month that they would work together to create contact tracing technology to slow the virus spread by allowing users to opt into logging other phones they have been near.
The rare collaboration is expected to accelerate usage of apps that aim to get potentially infected individuals into testing or quarantine more quickly and reliably than existing systems in much of the world. Such tracing will play a vital role in managing the virus once lockdowns end, health experts say.

The two tech companies have been working with public health experts and researchers to write apps that people can use to notify those they have come in contact with if they come down with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
Contract tracing is deemed necessary to reopen the U.S. economy, which has been hard hit by shutdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the disease which has killed more than 58,000 Americans.
Apps require a smartphone and only 82% of Americans said they had one, the poll found. Of those, only half said they would definitely or probably use such an app.
Much of the skepticism is based on concern about Google and Apple, the poll found.
Just 43% of smartphone users polled expressed ""a great deal"" or ""a good amount"" of trust in Google and Apple and other tech companies, while 47% expressed trust in health insurers, 56% in universities and 57% in public health agencies, the poll found.
Forty-seven percent of those polled believed that U.S. President Donald Trump s handling of the pandemic was ""good"" or ""excellent"" while 52% had a more negative view.
Support was widespread for measures to enforce social distancing. Sixty-six percent of those polled said restrictions on businesses were ""appropriate"" and 64% approved of current limits on public gatherings.
Those who did not find the restrictions appropriate were divided between wanting them relaxed or toughened.

Investing.com - Wall Street extended its gains on Wednesday on positive news about a potential therapy to treat Covid-19 patients and growing hopes of further stimulus ahead after Federal Reserve Chairman s Jerome Powell suggested the central bank and Congress will need to do more to keep to support an eventual economic recovery. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.41%, the S&P 500 added 2.88%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.69%.
""It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,"" Powell said, following the Fed s indication it will keep its benchmark rate within a 0% to 0.25% range.
""The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said Wednesday.    
Many have attributed the central bank’s efforts to prop up the economy to the recent surge in the broader market since the March 23 low.
Gilead Sciences  said a clinical trial evaluating its drug remdesivir in coronavirus patients had met its primary goal, sending its shares nearly 7% higher.
“The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir,” Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said in a statement.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was told data from the trial showed a “clear cut positive effect in diminishing time to recover.”
The positive news on the potential coronavirus treatment overshadowed data showing U.S. economic growth contracted at an annual rate of 4.8% in first quarter of the year.
FAANG stocks, meanwhile, clawed back some of their losses from a day earlier after Google-parent Alphabet  reported earnings that were better than feared. Facebook , which is set to report after the closing bell, was up about 6%, while Amazon  and Apple  were up more 2%.
Energy, meanwhile, also supported the broader market rally, underpinned by a jump in oil prices owing to a smaller-than-expected bid in weekly U.S. crude inventories.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors digested mixed quarterly results from corporates.
 General Electric   was down 2% after reported quarterly revenue above forecasts, but earnings of 5 cents per share missed estimates of 8 cents a share.
Toymaker Hasbro  reported quarterly results that just missed Wall Street estimates and warned it expected the coronavirus to hurt its sales of its toys and games in the second quarter."

U.S. Federal Reserve wrapped up its two-day monetary policy meeting, leaving key interest rates near zero and vowing to use a ""full range"" of its tools to aid the economy in the face of a pandemic that poses ""considerable"" medium term risks.
Stocks slightly trimmed their gains after the Fed s statement.

The U.S. economy suffered its sharpest decline in 11 years, with first-quarter GDP contracting at a 4.8% quarterly annualized rate according to the Commerce Department, marking the end of the longest U.S. economic expansion on record.

Investing.com - The stock market demonstrated its ability to turn any hopeful news into solid gains today, rallying sharply following a positive report on Gilead’s virus treatment.
And that enthusiasm could follow through tomorrow as big-name postmarket earnings satisfied the bulls.
Tesla , Facebook  and Microsoft  rose in after-hours trading following their results.
Investors shrugged off a sharp contraction in first-quarter GDP reported today, but tomorrow brings the more timely jobless claims numbers.
More big-name earnings arrive as well and it’s ECB decision day.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Rise in Jobless Claims Seen Tempering Again
Jobless claims will be in the spotlight ahead of trading tomorrow, with forecasts expecting them to show another decline in those filing for benefits but to be still at historically high levels.
The Labor Department reports weekly initial jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have risen by 3.5 million, down from a rise of 4.43 million the week before, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. 
Continuing claims are seen rising to about 19.3 million.
At the same time, March personal income and spending data arrive.
Spending is expected to have fallen 5% last month, with income down 1.5%.
2. Another Big Bout of Tech Earnings on Tap
Major tech earnings have so far justified the bullish bets of investors and two more big names will dominate the postmarket results Thursday.
Amazon , expected to be one of the few companies not struggling during the lockdown, reports its results.
Analysts are predicting a profit of $6.34 per share and revenue of about $72 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last week Goldman Sachs  boosted its price target on the stock to $2,900 from $2,600, the high-water market on Wall Street, and said it should report numbers well above the consensus.
“The increase in demand the company s retail, (cloud) and ads businesses is seeing and Amazon s ability to meet the challenges of this demand, will, we believe, serve to steepen the curve of its long term growth rate, drive incremental profitability, and further deepen the competitive moat around all of its businesses,” Goldman analyst Heath Terry said in a note.
Shareholders will also be looking for any response to President Donald Trump s assertions that package delivery companies should be paying much more to use the U.S. Postal Service.
Apple  will also issue its quarterly numbers.
The company is expected to post a profit of $2.31 per share and revenue of about $55 billion.
Apple is reportedly delaying the ramp-up in production of its flagship 2020 iPhones due to demand concerns and manufacturing disruption due to Covid-19.
Twitter  will report ahead of trading, with the consensus calling for a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of about $791 million.
And McDonald’s  will weigh in ahead of trading as well. Analysts predict earnings of $1.60 per share on sales of about $4.7 billion.
Investors will also be looking for ideas as to when the company will start opening up its restaurants.
3. ECB Decision, Press Conference Ahead
Central banks continue to be at the forefront tomorrow as the European Central Bank has its decision day.
The ECB will issue its policy statement at 7:45 AM ET (11:45 GMT).
ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold her press conference soon afterwards at 8:30 AM ET.
The central bank is not expected to make any moves on interest rates or adjustments to its 750 billion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until it gets better clarity on how the easing of lockdown measures is progressing.
Policymakers are also awaiting details from the EU on a potential proposed recovery fund for the coronavirus."

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus is roiling global job markets, but the picture is not all gloomy. Finance, technology and consumer goods firms are hiring tens of thousands in the United States and other countries, according to data from  Microsoft Corp  s  professional networking site LinkedIn .
Across seven countries in North America, Europe and Asia, healthcare providers are among the busiest recruiters given the ongoing battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed over 200,000 people and infected over 3 million people worldwide, LinkedIn said. But lifestyle changes during lockdown are also driving demand for financial consultants, factory workers, animators and game designers, and delivery workers.
Overall, the hiring rate has plunged in the first quarter from the year-ago period, and in late April remains lower than a year ago across most countries surveyed by the platform. But the data offer a glimmer of hope with a gradual uptick in China, where the coronavirus emerged last year and which leads the world in surfacing from a months-long lockdown.
LinkedIn, with over 690 million users worldwide, counts new hires when people add a new employer to their profile. The rate is the number of new hires divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in a country.
The figures, tracked since mid-February, are not corroborated by official jobs data and do not represent the actual number of jobs in an economy. Government figures are usually released with a time-lag of several weeks.
""We are confident that our data is directionally correct in that there has been a huge decline in hiring in the U.S. and abroad,"" Guy Berger, principal economist at LinkedIn in California, told Reuters.
Hiring in China plummeted 50% during the height of its coronavirus crisis in mid-February from 12 months earlier. Since restrictions were eased in early April, the hiring rate has inched up, and for the week ending April 24 was 3% lower than the same period in 2019.
Hiring in the United States, United Kingdom, France and Italy - which lead the world in coronavirus-related deaths - remains hugely depressed, but is falling less rapidly than a few weeks ago as the countries pass the peak of their epidemics.
Retailers including Walmart Inc , Amazon.com Inc  and Instacart have said they would hire a total of over 700,000 workers to meet a surge in demand for groceries and household essentials during the coronavirus outbreak. 
Consumer goods manufacturers such as  Unilever  , whose products include soap and shampoo, confirmed on Wednesday it was hiring to fill 300 jobs globally, but declined to elaborate.
Nestle  told Reuters it was looking to fill 5,000 full-time U.S. positions in ""a variety of levels across corporate and frontline.""
Fidelity Investments, a Boston-based financial services firm, said it had accelerated recruitment because of the pandemic and was looking to fill at least 2,000 full-time roles for financial consultants, software engineers and customer service staff in the United States in 2020.
Companies hiring in the United States and other countries also include Apple Inc ; ByteDance, the Chinese parent of video-sharing social network TikTok; Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502); and aerospace and defence company  Lockheed Martin  Corp . These companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
DIRE WARNINGS
The International Labour Organization warned on Wednesday that 1.6 billion workers, or nearly half of the global workforce, especially in the informal economy, could lose their livelihoods.
Record numbers of people have applied for U.S. jobless benefits since mid-March, and the unemployment rate is expected to soar to 16%, White House economic adviser Kevin Hasset said this week, from a 50-year low of 3.5% before the pandemic hit.
Both Italy and France, in lockdown for nearly two months, have seen hiring rates drop by around 70% from a year ago, according to LinkedIn.
Since China is ahead of other countries on the pandemic timeline, improvements there could suggest the same is in store elsewhere, Berger said. Several American states and European countries have begun allowing some non-essential businesses and schools to reopen in the hopes of restarting the economy and allowing a gradual return to normal life. 
""It s still slightly early to call it a firm recovery,"" Berger said, referring to improving prospects in China. ""We re not expecting a full recovery but rather it s an indication that parts of the economy will switch on as lockdowns are eased, at least relative to the worst point of the pandemic.""

Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Apple Inc  will retain their first and third spots on the leaderboard, but are both expected to lose market share to Chinese rivals, the market research firm said on Thursday.
That follows a 10% drop in output worldwide in the March quarter, when the outbreak spread and peaked in China before sweeping through Europe and the United States.
TrendForce cut its annual output forecast to 1.24 billion smartphones, down 11.3% from 2019, from 1.35 billion.
""The pandemic is now making its effects felt on the demand side of the smartphone market by tanking major economies worldwide,"" TrendForce said.
Apple, which is expected to report March-quarter results on Thursday, has slashed prices of its iPhone 11 in China, the only major market where its stores are open. It also launched a $399 iPhone it hopes will find takers in a frugal economy.
TrendForce estimates iPhone production fell nearly 9% to about 38 million units in the March quarter, and expects a further drop of 2 million units in the current one.
Apple s market share will slip to 12.6% this quarter from 13.5% in the last, TrendForce said.
Samsung s share of the market will ease 3 percentage points to 20.3% in the June quarter.
""Chinese brands are exerting continuous pressure on Samsung s presence in the Southeast Asian and Indian markets by the day,"" the firm added.
On Wednesday, the South Korean tech giant warned of significant declines in its mobile business in the second quarter.
China s Huawei, which saw revenue growth slow sharply in the first quarter, is expected to make about 48 million phones in the June quarter to meet recovering domestic demand, up 2 million from the March quarter, TrendForce said.

Chinese firms Xiaomi , Oppo and Vivo will each gain market share in the June quarter. TrendForce added that Vivo was the only smartphone brand among the top six to see volumes increase in the March quarter but warned things things were set to change in light of lockdowns in Southeast Asia and India."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc   will allow users in the United States and Canada to transfer photos and videos to a rival tech platform for the first time - a step that could assuage antitrust concerns by giving users an option to easily leave the company s services, the social media network said on Thursday. 
The tool lets Facebook users transfer data stored on its servers directly to another photo storage service, in this case Google Photos - a feature known as data portability.
U.S. and Canadian users will be able to access the tool through their Facebook accounts starting Thursday. The function has already been launched in several countries including in Europe and Latin America. 
It allows the social media company to give users more control over their data and respond to U.S. regulators and lawmakers who are investigating its competitive practices and allegations it has stifled competition. 
The U.S. launch also comes ahead of a hearing set up by the Federal Trade Commission on Sept. 22 to examine the potential benefits and challenges of data portability. Control of data that hurts competition has become a critical topic in the antitrust debate in the United States and Europe. 
Facebook s Director of Privacy and Public Policy Steve Satterfield said over the past couple of years, the company heard calls from policymakers and regulators asking it to facilitate choice, make it easier for people to choose new providers and move their data to new services. 
""So it really is an important part of the response to the kinds of concerns that drive antitrust regulation or competition regulation,"" Satterfield told Reuters in an interview. 
He said the company would be open to participating in the FTC hearing if the agency approaches them. 
Data portability is a requirement under Europe s privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California s privacy law called the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA). 
Also, Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Mark Warner of Virginia along with Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill, known as the ACCESS Act, in October, which requires large tech platforms to let their users easily move their data to other services.
Satterfield said Facebook hopes to eventually allow users to move key data such as their contacts, friend lists etc onto another platform in a way that protects user privacy. 
Facebook developed its data portability tool as a member of the Data Transfer Project - which was formed to allow web users to easily move their data between online service providers whenever they want - and counts Facebook, Alphabet s  Google, Microsoft , Twitter  and Apple  among its contributors.
Members of the project are also looking at letting users transfer data such as emails, playlists and events in the future, the company said.
On a call with academics and policy experts from the fields of competition and privacy on Wednesday, Facebook said it is moving deliberately on data transfer partnerships with third-parties to avoid a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica incident.

The now defunct British political consulting firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it for political advertising. "

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Thursday, consolidating recent gains amid tech sector strength and more hints of policy easing from the Federal Reserve.
At 7:15 AM ET (11:15 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq  futures up 25 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Jones 30 Futures contract fell 37 points, or 0.2%.
The DJIA cash index is on track for its best month since January 1987, while the S&P 500 is looking at its biggest monthly gains since October 1974.
The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged on Wednesday, but expressed a willingness to do more to support the economy if this was needed.
""It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said.
The need for more support could well be illustrated with the release of the latest weekly jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have risen by 3.5 million, down from a rise of 4.43 million the week before. This follows the hefty 4.8% slump in first-quarter gross domestic product, the first time the U.S. economy has contracted in six years.
The U.S. coronavirus death toll has surpassed 60,000, with more than one million confirmed cases, representing about a third of all cases from around the world.
Yet the move to reopen the economy is getting stronger after President Donald Trump said federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus would be “fading out”, putting the onus firmly on the state officials to allow the reopening of businesses.
Optimism has also been driven by positive partial results from a trial of Gilead  s antiviral drug remdesivir, which suggested it could help speed recovery from Covid-19.
The corporate earnings season continues Thursday, with the likes of McDonald’s reporting early and tech giants Amazon  and Apple  after the close.
Staying with the tech sector, shares in Facebook  traded over 9% higher premarket as the social media giant reported late Wednesday that its ad sales stabilized in recent weeks, part of a strong earnings report.
Microsoft s  shares climbed 2.6% premarket after the company reported fiscal third-quarter sales growth of 15% after Wednesday’s close, fueled by its cloud business.
Tesla s  shares climbed 8% premarket after surprising with a first-quarter profit amid the broad economic destruction wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil futures pushed higher Thursday, helped by stockpiles of U.S. crude rising less than expected last week - in a clear weakening of the recent trend.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 17% higher at $17.62 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 8.3% to $26.24.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1% to $1,729.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0877, largely flat."

Countries are rushing to develop apps which, along with a wider testing and tracking programme, are seen as key to easing social distancing rules that have all but shut global economies. 
Matthew Gould, chief executive of the National Health Service s technology group NHSX, told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that an app could be rolled out widely in Britain in two to three weeks.
It will keep a record of anonymised tokens or identities of those people the phone s owner has been in contact with. The data will stay on the phone until the owner becomes symptomatic when they will have the option to submit the data to the app, alerting those with whom they came into contact. 
Leading academics and scientists working in security and privacy at universities across Britain published a joint letter saying Britons would only adopt the app if they felt their privacy was protected. 
""It is vital that, when we come out of the current crisis, we have not created a tool that enables data collection on the population, or on targeted sections of society, for surveillance,"" they said. 
In Europe, most countries have chosen short-range Bluetooth ""handshakes"" between mobile devices as the best way to register a potential contact, although it does not provide location data.
But they have disagreed about whether to log such contacts on individual devices or on a central server - which would be more directly useful to existing contact tracing teams. 
Germany recently changed course, saying it would join a growing number of other European countries in adopting a ""decentralised"" approach supported by Apple  and Google .
Gould told the parliamentary committee he believed the British app would protect privacy even though it would build a centralised system. He said NHSX would publish the privacy model close to launch.
He said later versions of the app could also ask users to provide more details such as location, if they agreed. 
""We really believe there are big advantages to the way we re doing it but we don t believe that it s privacy endangering,"" he said. 
Gould was asked during the hearing whether Britain s National Cyber Security Centre was involved in the decision to adopt the more centralised approach. He said the body had been part of the discussions.

Google announced the $2.1 billion deal in November, as it seeks to compete with Apple  and Samsung (KS:005930) in the market for fitness trackers and smart watches. The deal is being evaluated by the U.S. Justice Department to ensure it complies with antitrust law.
Public Knowledge and the Consumer Federation of America wrote in a letter to Attorney General William Barr that because Google has few direct competitors that nascent or potential competition becomes more important.
""It is critical to consider what assets could very effectively offer an avenue for expansion ... if allowed to remain independent and team up with dominant platform adversaries,"" they wrote in the letter, which was dated on Wednesday and released on Thursday.
Fitbit, whose fitness trackers and other devices monitorusers  daily steps, calories burned and distance traveled,would give the U.S. tech giant access to a trove of health data.
The groups also argued that although Google says it does not plan to use data collected by Fitbit for advertising, it could be valuable to others.
""By keeping the ongoing data streams that Fitbit has access to out of the hands of a competitor or potential competitor, Google may prevent competition it could otherwise face,"" the letter said.
Google declined to comment on the letter but has previously noted that it has no products in the fitness wearables sector, and provides tools for users to control their data, including exporting it to other platforms.
A European Union privacy watchdog, the European Data Protection Board, warned that the purchase could pose privacy risks.

The Justice Department had no immediate comment on the letter."

(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  s (N:BRKa) annual meeting will be nothing like the extravaganzas of years past, but will give Warren Buffett a chance to show how resilient his cash-rich conglomerate may be to the coronavirus pandemic, and the investment opportunities it offers.
The meeting and surrounding festivities that Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" normally draw more than 40,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska to see and hear one of the world s richest people and most revered investors.
But Berkshire has scrapped most of this year s fun, and Buffett fans will need their computers and smartphones to watch the Saturday afternoon meeting, broadcast on Yahoo  Finance. 
Buffett, who is Berkshire s chairman and chief executive officer, has been notably quiet about the coronavirus, ever since calling the COVID-19 outbreak and plunging oil prices ""a big one-two punch"" in early March.
He has also eschewed the kind of splashy investments, such as in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc , he made during in the 2008 financial crisis.
Shareholders nonetheless said they expect Buffett to show Berkshire can successfully weather a deep recession.
""He s an optimist,"" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC, who invests 11% of assets he oversees in Berkshire stock. ""He will reflect on the country s resilience, and how we ll overcome this, as we have overcome so many other challenges. That s how he looks at the world.""
ABEL TAKES STAGE
Buffett, 89, will be joined by Greg Abel, 57, a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire s non-insurance operating businesses, in answering shareholder questions at the meeting.
Abel and Ajit Jain, another vice chairman, have long been viewed as Buffett s likeliest successors as CEO.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally answers shareholder questions with Buffett, and Jain, 68, will not be in attendance. Unlike Abel, both live far from Omaha.
Berkshire is also likely on Saturday morning to report a huge first-quarter net loss, as investments such as  American Express  , Bank of America  and the four largest U.S. airlines sank in value.
Many investors will focus on the quarterly performance of Berkshire s more than 90 operating businesses, which in 2019 posted an average $6 billion of quarterly profit.
The pandemic s impact may be evident in falling volumes at the BNSF railroad, premium waivers and lower accident claims at the Geico auto insurer, and store closures by retailers such as See s Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart. 
""As goes Berkshire, so goes the economy,"" said Lawrence Cunningham, a George Washington University law professor who has published several books on Berkshire.
UNDERPERFORMANCE PERSISTS
Investors will also look for how far Berkshire dipped into its $128 billion year-end cash hoard, whether through investments in other stocks or repurchases of its own.
Munger told The Wall Street Journal two weeks ago that Berkshire s phone is not ""ringing off the hook"" with companies seeking support.
Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, likened the environment to the 1974 bear market, when Buffett told Forbes magazine he felt like an ""oversexed man in a harem"" when looking for investment opportunities.
Berkshire, however, was then far smaller than the $461 billion behemoth it has become.
""You can t pour water from a barrel into a teacup,"" Smead said, while adding he wished Buffett would admit stockpiling cash was a mistake: ""He needs to work for the benefit of those who, like him, have over 90% of their net worth in the company.""
Through Wednesday, Berkshire s stock price was down 16% in 2020, versus a 9% drop in the Standard & Poor s 500 (SPX).
And last year, Berkshire lagged the index by 20.5 percentage points, including dividends.
Berkshire said Buffett and Abel will not be given shareholder questions in advance, and will not talk about specific Berkshire investments. That suggests that Berkshire s holdings in banks, airlines and Apple Inc  may be off-limits.

Cunningham said it will be important for Abel to show how his core values align with Berkshire s, and to ""convey a sense of himself."""

Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Thursday as investors weighed up earnings from corporates against further data underscoring the Covid-19 hit to the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.52%, the S&P 500 lost 1.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.83%.
The reopening of the economy has stoked some investor hopes the downturn in the economy may not be as bad as many fear, but the ongoing surge in jobless claims and signs the consumer is trouble has weighed on sentiment.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by 3.8 million, compared with 4.4 million last week, missing economists  forecasts of 3.5 million.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 7.5% last month, the steepest monthly decline on record.
The grim economic background overshadowed a surge in large-cap tech stocks, led by Facebook, as investors cheered bullish earnings.
Facebook  rose 4.5% after the social media giant reported revenue that topped consensus estimates and said it was seeing signs of stability in ad revenue after a coronavirus-led slowdown in March.
Microsoft  gained 0.5% as the tech giant beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.  
Twitter , meanwhile, fell 9% on fears its slowing ad revenue, which fell 27% from March 11 to March 31, is set to continue.
Apple  and Amazon.com , both of which report earnings after the bell, were up 1.28% and 2.44% respectively.
Beyond tech, Tesla  gave up some gains to trade 4% lower even as the electric automaker s surprise quarterly profit triggered a wave of price target upgrades from Wall Street firms.
Energy, meanwhile, was among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a jump in oil prices, even as concerns of supply constraints persist."

The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims slowed to a pace of 3.8 million, compared with 4.4 million last week, but still above economists  forecasts of 3.5 million.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 7.5% last month, the steepest monthly decline on record.
Financials were among the biggest decliners, giving up its recent gains, as the weaker economic data cooled expectations that a partial economic reopening would kickstart the labor market and potentially lead to a decline in credit losses for big Wall Street banks.
But large-cap tech stocks proved a resilient, led by Facebook, as investors cheered bullish earnings.
Facebook  rose 5.4% after the social media giant reported revenue that topped consensus estimates and said it was seeing signs of stability in ad revenue after a coronavirus-led slowdown in March.

Investing.com - Apple reported on Thursday second-quarter earnings that beat analysts  forecasts and revenue that topped expectations as a jump in services revenue helped ease the impact of declining iPhone revenue.
Apple shares gained 1.74% in after-hours trade following the report.
Apple announced earnings per share of $2.55 on revenue of $58.31 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.31 on revenue of $54.99 billion. That compared with an EPS of $2.46 on revenue of $58.02 billion in the same period a year before. Apple had reported EPS of $4.99 on revenue of $91.82 billion in the previous quarter.
“Despite COVID-19’s unprecedented global impact, we’re proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter, driven by an all-time record in services and a quarterly record for wearables,” CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.
IPhone revenue fell to about $29 billion from $31 billion year-on-year and services revenue grew to $13.3 billion from $11.4 billion.
Greater China revenue dropped to $9.5 billion from $10.2 billion a year earlier as coronavirus-led disruptions to the supply chain weighed on growth.
Apple raised its dividend by 6% and bumped up its existing share buyback program by $50 billion.
Analysts are expecting Apple to report EPS of $2.09 and revenue of $51.27 billion in the upcoming quarter.
""Unlike many tech service providers whose businesses are growing in this pandemic, Apple is not in the same boat,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. ""The company is heavily dependent on retail sales of iPhones which may not be on top of the customers’ buying list when millions of people are losing their jobs. Any sign of sales recovery in China after reopening there, and a solid plan to navigate in this tough environment should support Apple stock in the short-run even if the current numbers are weak."""

Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Commerce Committee, and other key Republicans introduced the bill that would ""hold businesses accountable to consumers if they use personal data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic."" 
The bill would allow technology companies to develop ""platforms that could trace the virus and help flatten the curve and stop the spread – and maintaining privacy protections for U.S. citizens,"" said Republican Senator John Thune.
Alphabet  s Google and Apple  have been working with public health experts and researchers to write apps that people can use to notify those they have come in contact with if they come down with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
This kind of ""contact tracing"" is deemed necessary to reopen the U.S. economy, which has been hard hit by shutdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the disease which has killed more than 60,000 Americans.
Other co-sponsors of the bill are Senators Jerry Moran, who called the tech companies  efforts ""well intentioned"" and Marsha Blackburn.
""As Congress seeks to enact a uniform comprehensive data privacy and security framework, thoughtful and targeted legislative efforts, like this bill, will address specific consumer privacy violations resulting from COVID-19,"" Moran said in a statement.
The bill would require companies to obtain express consent from people if data about their health, location or proximity to another person is collected, require companies to disclose what will happen with their data, require companies to take steps to ensure that anonymized data does not allow individuals to be identified and require companies to delete all personally identifiable information once it is no longer used to track the spread of the coronavirus.
State attorneys general would enforce the bill.
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill.

The companies have previously said that ""privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance"" in building the apps. They have also said that users  interactions would be tracked, not their locations, and that nothing would be monetized."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations Thursday, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook saying China sales were ""headed in the right direction"" as that country reopens from the novel coronavirus.
But Cook said it was impossible to forecast overall results for the current quarter because of uncertainty created by the virus. Shares declined 2.4% to $286.56 in extended trading.
With its global brand, few American companies have been exposed to the spread of the coronavirus like Apple, whose iPhone sales declined in the March quarter as device sales were forced to online-only in many places. Sales of subscription services such as streaming television content rose with billions of people locked in their homes, which pushed the overall number of subscribers to paid apps and services on Apple s devices to 515 million. 
China, where the virus was first detected, is both a major market for Apple, supplying about a sixth of its overall sales, and is also home to most of Apple s contract factories.
Apple saw China sales of $9.46 billion, down less than a $1 billion from a year ago, a potential sign of how the company will fare as other markets emerge from lockdowns.
Apple slowly reopened Chinese stores, with all running again by mid-March. ""As compared to February, we saw a nice improvement in March and a further improvement in April. China is headed in the right direction,"" Cook told Reuters in an interview.
Apple reported overall sales of $58.3 billion and earnings of $2.55 per share for its fiscal second quarter ended in March, above year-ago results of $58 billion and $2.46, and above analyst estimates of $54.5 billion and $2.27, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Cook said the first five weeks of the fiscal second quarter, ""it was an incredible time where we were growing very fast and we were set to essentially come in at the high end of our guidance"" of between $63 billion and $67 billion in sales. 
But the quarter changed quickly, and Apple broke with its usual practice of providing an estimated range of sales for the current quarter.
""Rather than pretend we can project it, we re being very straightforward and saying we lack the visibility to do it,"" Cook told Reuters.
Apple stores outside mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea remained shuttered. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Cook said that Apple plans to reopen retail stores in Austria and Australia in one to two weeks and a small number of stores in the United States in the first half of May.
Lockdowns forced Apple to release its newest iPhone SE 2 mostly via online sales. Cook said that he was pleased with early sales of the new device, along with new Macs and iPads released during the fiscal second quarter. ""As compared to the last part of March and the beginning of April, we ve seen a better second half of April,"" Cook told Reuters.
Cook declined to comment on whether Apple faces supply chain disruptions for devices that will be released later this year. He said Apple’s supply chain was “back up and running at full-throttle at the end of March.” 
Apple on Thursday also said it would buy back another $50 billion of its own stock, a smaller figure than in past updates to its capital return program, but ""we expect them to use those funds aggressively,"" said Brian Pirri, a principal at Apple shareholder New England Investment and Retirement Group. ""They also managed to do all of this with only a $14.3 billion drawdown on their cash holdings, which still sit at a whopping $192.8 billion.""
Apple said iPhone sales were $29.0 billion, down from $30.9 billion the year before compared with analyst estimates of $28.4 billion, to data from FactSet.
Sales for Apple s services segment, which includes iCloud storage as well as its streaming services for music and television shows, were $13.4 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $12.9 billion, according to FactSet data. Cook said Apple had 515 million subscribers to apps and services on Apple s platform, up by 125 million from one year earlier. Cook said during a conference call with analysts that Apple News reached 125 million monthly active users, up from 100 million in January.
""The group was quiet on AppleTV+, and we wonder how many subscribers were added in the quarter, especially following updates from rivals like Netflix  and Disney+,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown . 

Apple s wearables and accessories segment, which includes Apple s AirPods and Apple Watch, were $6.3 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $6.7 billion, according to FactSet data."

China s Huawei, the No.2 smartphone seller in the world by volume, grabbed 41.4% of the domestic market, up from 33.9% a year earlier. Its overall unit shipments rose about 1% to 30.1 million.
That growth came at the expense of Android rivals Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi  Corp. The three companies saw shipments plunge by 26%, 19%, and 26%, respectively.
All four companies rely significantly on overseas sales for revenue, although Huawei will depend on the domestic market increasingly as its latest devices do not run the complete suite of Google  Mobile Services due to restrictions placed on it by the U.S. government.
Apple shipments sank more than 4%, marking a significant dip but below the industry average. However, its share of the market grew, hitting 8.5% from 7.3% last year.
Apple reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook saying China sales were ""headed in the right direction"" as the country reopens from restrictions imposed to curb the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Apple is expected to release its first 5G phone later this year. Online retailers in China recently slashed prices of the iPhone 11, and analysts said the company s new, mid-range iPhone SE was selling better than expected in the country. 
After enduring years of market contraction, Chinese Android smartphone players were hoping that releasing new 5G models would prompt consumers to purchase new devices. 
But analysts now expect consumers will delay purchasing 5G phones, opting instead for cheaper, still serviceable 4G devices as a coronavirus-induced recession looms.
“Looking ahead, we remain cautious about the speed of recovery in China’s smartphone market this year, and maintain our best-case scenario of 326 million shipments for 2020, including 137 million 5G smartphones,"" said Nicole Peng, vice president of mobility at Canalys.
""The macroeconomic situation is a huge red flag for China’s market players this year.""

Market research firm TrendForce said on Thursday it expects 2020 smartphone output globally to slump 11.3% to 1.24 billion."

CHAMBLON, Switzerland (Reuters) - In the battle against coronavirus, Swiss soldiers are using smartphones to test a new contact tracing application that could prevent infections while also protecting users  privacy.
Switzerland hopes to launch the app on May 11 based on a standard, developed by researchers in Lausanne and Zurich, that uses Bluetooth communication between devices to assess the risk of catching COVID-19.
A hundred soldiers from the Chamblon army base near Lausanne volunteered to download the app and then go about their regular routines for 24 hours.
If they spend 15 minutes within two metres of each other, that information is logged on their devices and they must exchange a validation card given by researchers so the data can be checked.
The apps “do that in an encrypted way, and the records stay on the phone”, Marcel Salathe, director of the digital epidemiology lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), told Reuters Television.
“If a person eventually gets positively tested, they can upload their ID to the system and then all the other apps can check whether they have been close to that person and can then call the health authorities,” he added.
Speed is vital. COVID-19 can be spread by people without symptoms, making it important to react quickly when an individual tests positive and warn those they have contacted.
“The idea of this app is really to aid contact tracing,"" said Salathe. ""Usually this is done in a way that is person based, and with this app, we hope to support this process so that it is much faster.”
LIKE A SUBMARINE
EPFL project manager Alfredo Sanchez compared the app to “a submarine that sends sound markers and listens to the echoes that are coming back”.
Although early results with Bluetooth-based contact tracing in countries like Singapore have been modest, backers say it can help if large numbers participate.
Amid concerns about whether such technology can be used by governments to increase surveillance, the Swiss team has taken a privacy-first approach.
Records of Bluetooth exchanges between smartphones are kept on devices, not on a central server.
Salathe warned that, with a central server, ”you start adding more and more things that, on their own, don’t look very problematic. But, actually, you are slowly building something that is very close to a really intrusive surveillance machinery.""
The Swiss app would be the first of its kind to have a decentralized design compatible with new standards from Apple  and Google , whose operating systems run 99% of the world’s smartphones.
In Geneva, people’s views on the app are mixed.
Hamza Fawaz, a resident in his 30s, has doubts about data protection and will not use the app. But conference interpreter Beatrice Mallet, in her 60s, is “completely ready”.
“It can be useful and if it allows us to get out more quickly from this health crisis, this is a good thing”, she said.

The Swiss Parliament is expected to debate the app next week."

Investing.com -- President Donald Trump has raised the spectre of another trade war with China, threatening new tariffs on Beijing citing China s role in the origin and spread of the novel coronavirus. The airline industry showed its pain over the global lockdown and earnings releases centre around the oil industry. And there s the April U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI data to study. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 1st May.
1. Tech disappoints; Amazon  shareholders should “take a seat”
It’s not all shiny and bright in Silicon Valley, as a couple of tech giants disappointed the market after the bell on Thursday.
Amazon stock slumped almost 5% in after-hours trade after stating it would spend its entire second-quarter profit, seen at around $4 billion, on Covid-19 related expenses. 
“If you’re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we’re not thinking small,” said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement explaining the hefty jump in expenses.
Apple  stock fell 2.6% after hours despite reporting a slight uptick in revenue for its latest quarter as its services business picked up the slack caused by the coronavirus denting iPhone sales in China. 
However, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pointed to an uncertain future, saying it was impossible to forecast overall results for the current quarter because of uncertainty created by the virus.
This was the first time Apple omitted an earnings forecast in more than a decade. 
Facebook  and Microsoft  had offered up stellar earnings earlier this week.
2. Manufacturers have little to smile about
The latest dismal economic number is likely to come Friday from the Institute of Supply Management, which will issue its April purchasing managers’ index at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
The ISM manufacturing PMI is expected to have dropped to 36.9 last month from 49.1 in March, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com, rapidly approaching the record low below 30 in 1980.
Earlier, the British equivalent saw its manufacturers suffering the biggest fall in output and orders for at least three decades in April.
April s final IHS Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index fell to a record-low 32.6 from March s 47.8, broadly in line with the earlier flash estimate of 32.9 released on April 23.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Trump hints at another trade war
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, coming off the best April for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 in 82 years. Threatening rhetoric from President Donald Trump about another trade war with China will likely weigh on the market ahead of the release of ISM manufacturing PMI data at 10:00 AM ET. 
Late Thursday Trump made it clear that his concerns about China s role in the origin and spread of the coronavirus were taking priority for now over his efforts to build on an initial trade agreement with Beijing.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was down 414 points or 1.7%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was 53 points or 1.8% lower and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 207 points or 2.3%.
In Asia, with many markets closed, the benchmark Nikkei index fell 2.8%, while Australian shares fell 5%, their most in five weeks. 
In Europe, most markets are closed for a May 1 public holiday, but the FTSE 100 in London dropped over 2%.
4. Pain of airlines plain to see
Ryanair announced Friday it would ground more than 99% of its flights until July and said it had begun negotiations with Boeing  about cutting the number of aircraft deliveries over the next 24 months.
Europe s largest low-cost carrier said it would take at least two years for passenger demand to return to normal, which could result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs.
Lufthansa  is negotiating a 10 billion euro ($10.98 billion) bailout that would result in Germany taking a 25.1% stake in the airline, according to reports Friday.
Meanwhile, the fate of Norwegian Air Shuttle  was in the balance on Friday after a deadline passed overnight for bondholders to vote on a rescue package for the transatlantic budget airline.
Late Thursday, United Airlines  announced a loss of $1.7 billion in the first quarter, as it attempted to manage “the most disruptive global crisis in the history of aviation.” 
5. U.S. oil giants in the spotlight
 Exxon Mobil   and  Chevron  , the two largest U.S. oil producers, are set to report first quarter earnings Friday. 
Exxon had already been facing quizzical glances before Covid-19 hit, because of its high capital expenditure at a time when most oil companies were cutting back. It is set to report earnings of 4 cents per share, down from 55 cents per share in the year-ago period, on revenue of about $54.8 billion, and has to explain how it can successfully navigate these tricky waters while maintaining its healthy dividend.
Chevron looks to be in a stronger position. It is set to report earnings of 65 cents per share on $29.80 billion in revenue, and has already announced that it would be halting share buybacks and lowering its capital spending by 20%."

Late Thursday, Trump said trade relations with China now had to give way in importance to the coronavirus pandemic and he threatened new tariffs on Beijing who he blames for the spread of the virus,
It was only in January that Trump signed a first phase of a multibillion-dollar trade deal with China, seeking to quell what had become a damaging trade war.
""We signed a trade deal where they re supposed to buy, and they ve been buying a lot, actually. But that now becomes secondary to what took place with the virus,"" Trump said. ""The virus situation is just not acceptable.""
The corporate earnings season continues Thursday, with the oil sector in focus as U.S. giants  Exxon Mobil   and  Chevron   report before the bell.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower Friday, consolidating after record gains in April, hurt by President Donald Trump threatening new tariffs on China in retaliation for the coronavirus crisis. Disappointments from tech giants Apple  and Amazon  also weighed.
Trump said late on Thursday his trade deal with China, the first phase having been signed only in January, was now of secondary importance to the pandemic, which he blames Beijing for.
White House NEC Director Larry Kudlow played down the likelihood on tariffs in the near term, saying in a CNBC interview that he doesn t believe there will be a ""rush"" to slap China with tariffs, but he wants them to be held accountable.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 425 points, or 1.75%, while the S&P 500 was down 2%. The Nasdaq Composite underperformed, losing 2.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 posted their best monthly gains since 1987 in April, and the Nasdaq Composite booked its best month since 2000.
Amazon  stock was down 4.9% after the e-commerce behemoth said it would spend its entire second-quarter profit, seen at around $4 billion, on Covid-19 related expenses. 
CEO Jeff Bezos was unapologetic, saying ""if you re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat because we re not thinking small.""
Apple  stock fell 1.8% after failing to provide an earnings forecast given the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, the first time it has done so in more than a decade. 
Honeywell  stock fell 3.7% after the aero supplier became the latest in the sector to pull its 2020 outlook on weak demand."

Investing.com – The Dow declined on Friday, paced by declines in Amazon and Apple, after their earnings reports failed to live up to investor expectations, and fresh worries over U.S.-China tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.37%, the S&P 500 lost 2.76%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.07%.
With many seeing the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic in the rearview mirror, investors sentiment was dealt a blow as President Donald Trump renewed the prospect of a fresh U.S.-China conflict.  
Trump insisted Beijing would be held accountable for its role in the pandemic after alleging that the virus originated from a lab in China.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told CNBC there was ""no question"" Trump would follow through on his threat.
On the earnings front, Amazon.com  fell 6.6% after the e-commerce giant late Thursday reported lower first-quarter earnings and said it expected an operating loss of $1.5 billion to an operating income of $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to a jump in Covid-19-related expenses.
Apple , meanwhile, fell 1%, after reporting flat revenue growth. It did not offer guidance for the June quarter, citing coronavirus uncertainty.
Newell Brands , meanwhile, slumped 10% after the manufacturer reported a decline in quarterly earnings and revenue.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a climb in oil prices as major oil-producing countries got their agreed output cuts underway in a bid to offset falling demand."

Investing – The Dow ended the week on a sour note, as investor sentiment was rocked by fresh U.S.-China worries as President Donald Trump threatened action against Beijing over the Covid-19 pandemic.
The {{169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} fell 2.55%, the S&P 500 lost 2.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.2%.
Trump suggested that his administration could place tariffs on China or cancel part of its debt obligations to Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus, claiming to have evidence showing the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The threat of new tariffs on China stoked investor jitters about a fresh U.S.-China trade war, overshadowing some of recent optimism over the partial reopening of the U.S.
The lockdown measures to contain the outbreak have wreaked havoc on the economy, wiping out all the jobs created since the financial crisis and pushing the economy to contract by more 4% in the first quarter, with fears running high that a prolonged recession looms.
With a vaccine still at the minimum months away, drugmakers are in a race against time to produce Covid-19 treatments that can support efforts to get the wheels of the economy turning once again, with Gilead s  remdesivir leading the pack.
The Food and Drug Administration granted the drug emergency use authorization, President Donald Trump said Friday, according to CNBC.
The latest data on manufacturing activity, however, was better than feared, though the sector continued to remain in contraction.
The impact of the virus has also been evident across quarterly earnings reports as companies have pulled guidance, citing coronavirus-led uncertainty.
Amazon.com  fell 7.4% after the e-commerce giant late Thursday reported lower first-quarter earnings and said it expected an operating loss of $1.5 billion to an operating income of $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to a jump in Covid-19-related expenses.
Apple , meanwhile, fell 1.6%, after reporting flat revenue growth and ditching its custom of proving guidance for the June.
Newell Brands  slumped 11.4% after the manufacturer reported a decline in quarterly earnings and revenue.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a climb in oil prices as major oil-producing countries got their agreed output cuts underway in a bid to offset falling demand."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street sold off sharply on Friday after President Donald Trump revived a threat of new tariffs against China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought global economies to a grinding halt.
All three major U.S. stock averages closed down well over 2%, and for the week they all lost ground.
May is often marked by sell-offs, and on the month s first day, with jitters on the rise as some U.S. states begin easing coronavirus shutdowns, the adage held true. 
""Markets had a very strong April as they looked through the valley of economic weakness to a point when stimulus will reignite economic growth,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""But it could be a longer and deeper valley than many hoped.""
Indeed, stocks had a remarkable run in April, with the S&P 500 and the Dow both posting their strongest monthly percentage gains in 33 years. 
Trump said his administration was crafting retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the coronavirus outbreak, once again sparking tariff fears that rattled markets through much of the last two years. Trump has blamed China for what he says is ""misinformation"" when the virus emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan and then quickly spread around the world.
""Trump poking China was the last thing markets needed given so much present economic and financial uncertainty,"" Carter added.
A mixed bag of earnings, particularly a disappointing report from Amazon.com , along with a fresh round of dismal economic data, also weighed on sentiment.
U.S. manufacturing activity skidded to an 11-year low last month as lockdowns shuttered factories, according to the Institute for Supply Management s purchasing managers index.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 622.03 points, or 2.55%, to 23,723.69, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 81.72 points, or 2.81%, to 2,830.71, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 284.60 points, or 3.2%, to 8,604.95.
All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 closed in the red, with energy companies (SPNY) suffering the largest percentage drop.
The corporate reporting season has crossed the midpoint, with 275 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results. Of those, 68% have beaten consensus estimates.
In aggregate, first-quarter S&P 500 earnings are seen having fallen 12.7% from a year ago, a stark reversal from the 6.3% annual growth forecast that stood on Jan. 1.
Tesla Inc  plunged 10.3% after company Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a tweet that the electric car maker s stock price was ""too high.""
Amazon.com  shares slid 7.6% after the online retailer warned pandemic-related expenses could lead to its first quarterly loss in five years.
Apple Inc s  quarterly results beat expectations, but the iPhone maker declined to provide current-quarter forecasts. Its shares lost 1.6%.
 Exxon Mobil   dropped 7.2% after the company reported a drop in profit due to a massive $3 billion writedown on plummeting oil demand and prices.
Rival  Chevron  Corp  posted a 38% profit increase, boosted by asset sales, and slashed spending plans. Its shares dipped 2.8%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq , a 4.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 12 new lows.

697,https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/buffett-says-coronavirus-cannot-stop-america-2158795,2020-05-03,"Warren Buffett says the coronavirus cannot stop America, or Berkshire Hathaway By Reuters","(This May 2 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of ""towel"" in second paragraph)
By Jonathan Stempel and Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States  capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic ""quite an experiment"" that had an ""extraordinarily wide"" range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American ""magic"" prevailed before and would do again, he said. 
""Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,"" Buffett said. ""I will bet on America the rest of my life.""
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo  Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
BERKSHIRE EXITS AIRLINES
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp  and Apple Inc  during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be ""considerably less"" than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said ""we re willing to do something very big,"" perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its ""entire positions"" in the four largest:  American Airlines Group  Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co  and United Airlines Holdings Inc .
Buffett said he ""made a mistake"" investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed ""in a very major way"" with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
""It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,"" he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""
ABEL SHARES THE STAGE
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in ""fine shape"" and ""good health,"" and looked forward to attending Berkshire s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors ""I don t see the culture of Berkshire changing"" after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, ""we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.""

Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding  American Express  Co , to Berkshire s board, making him the company s first African American director."

PARIS (Reuters) - France s state-supported ""StopCOVID"" contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase in the week of May 11 when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister said on Sunday. 
Minister for Digital Affairs Cedric O, a member of President Emmanuel Macron s inner circle, presented the app as a key element of France s strategy to stave off the coronavirus as authorities grapple with the prospect of mass testing. 
""There s nothing magical about this app, but it s not technological coquetry either,"" O wrote on online publishing platform Medium. ""It s only useful if it s integrated into a global health system."" 
Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk of one person infecting another, helping to isolate those who could spread the disease.
Like others in Europe, France has chosen the short-range Bluetooth ""handshakes"" between devices as the best approach, dismissing the alternative of using location data pursued by some countries in Asia as intrusive.
But debate has raged about whether to log such contacts on individual devices or on a central server - which would be more directly useful to existing contact tracing teams that work phones and knock on doors to warn those who may be at risk.
France has so far opted for a ""centralised"" approach, which would need Apple  in particular to change the settings on its iPhones. The smartphone maker has refused to budge, although discussions with the U.S. company were ongoing, O said. 
""French health and technological sovereignty ... is the freedom for our country to be able to have the choice and not be constrained by the choices of a large company, however innovative and efficient it may be,"" O wrote. 
France s most important European partner, Germany, changed course last week over which type of smartphone technology it wanted to use, backing an approach supported by Google  and Apple along with a growing number of other European countries.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Tang Yue, a 27-year-old teacher from the city of Guilin in southwest China, steam-presses a blue dress and takes dozens of photographs before picking one to clinch her 200th online sale. 
For a growing number of Chinese like Tang, hit by job losses, furloughs and salary cuts, the consumer economy has begun to spin in reverse. They are no longer buying - they are selling.
Instead of emerging from the coronavirus epidemic and returning to the shopping habits that helped drive the world s second-largest economy, many young people are offloading possessions and embracing a new-found ethic for hard times: less is more.
With Tang s monthly salary of about 7,000 yuan ($988), the self-described shopaholic said she has bought everything from Chanel lipsticks to Apple  s latest iPad in the past three years. 
But the adrenaline rush that comes with binge-shopping is gone, said Tang, whose wages have been slashed with the suspension of all the classes on tourism management she usually teaches.
""The coronavirus outbreak was a wake-up call,"" she said. ""When I saw the collapse of so many industries, I realised I had no financial buffer should something unfortunate happen to me."" 
There is no guarantee that the nascent minimalist trend will continue once the coronavirus crisis is fully over, but if it does, it could seriously damage China s consumer sector and hurt thousands of businesses from big retailers to street-corner restaurants, gyms and beauty salons.
To be sure, there are signs that pent-up demand will drive a rush of spending as authorities reopen malls, leisure venues and tourist spots. In South Korea, the first major economy outside of China to be hit by the virus, people thronged malls this weekend to go ""revenge shopping"" to make up for time lost in lockdown., 
There are some signs that a similar trend will take hold in China, where some upscale malls are starting to get busy, although luxury firm  Kering   SA - which owns Gucci, Balenciaga and other fashion brands - has said it is hard to predict how or when sales in China might come back.
A recent McKinsey & Co survey showed that between 20% and 30% of respondents in China said they would continue to be cautious, either consuming slightly less or, in a few cases, a lot less.
""The lockdown provided consumers with a lot of time and reasons to reflect and consider what is important to them,"" said Mark Tanner, managing director at Shanghai-based research and marketing consultancy China Skinny.
""With much more of their days spent in their homes, consumers also have more time and reasons to sort through things they don t feel they need – so they re not living around clutter that is common in many apartments."" 
#DITCHYOURSTUFF
Tang made a spreadsheet to keep track of her nearly 200 cosmetic products and hundreds of pieces of clothing. She then marked a few essentials in red that she wanted to keep. In the past two months, she has sold items worth nearly 5,000 yuan on second-hand marketplaces online. 
Bargain-hunting online has become a new habit for some Chinese as the stigma that once hung over second-hand goods has begun to fade. 
Idle Fish, China s biggest online site for used goods, hit a record daily transaction volume in March, its parent company  Alibaba   told Reuters. 
Government researchers predict that transactions for used goods in China may top 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) this year.
Posts with the hashtag #ditchyourstuff have trended on Chinese social media in recent weeks, garnering more than 140 million views. 
Jiang Zhuoyue, 31, who works as an accountant at a traditional Chinese medicine company in Beijing - one of the few industries that may benefit from the health crisis - has also decided to turn to a simpler life.
""I used to shop too much and could be easily lured by discounts,"" said Jiang. ""One time Sephora offered 20% off for all goods, I then bought a lot of cosmetics because I feel I m losing money if I don t.""
Jiang, the mother of a 9-month-old baby, said she recently sold nearly 50 pieces of used clothing as the lockdown gave her the opportunity to clear things out. ""It also offered me a chance to rethink what s essential to me, and the importance of doing financial planning,"" she said. 
Eleven Li, a 23-year-old flight attendant, said she used to spend her money on all manner of celebrity-endorsed facial masks, snacks, concert tickets and social media activity, but now has no way to fund her spending.
""I just found a new job late last year, then COVID-19 came along, and I haven t been able to fly once since I joined, and I ve gotten no salary at all,"" said Li, who said she was trying to sell her Kindle. 
Some are even selling their pets, as they consider leaving big cities like Beijing and Shanghai where the high cost of living is finally catching up with them.
NO RETURN TO OLD WAYS?
As the coronavirus comes under control in China, the government is gradually releasing cities from lockdown, easing transport restrictions and encouraging consumers to venture back into malls and restaurants by giving out billions-worth of cash vouchers, worth between 10 yuan and 100 yuan.
But many people say they are still worried about job security and potential wage cuts because of the struggling economy. Nationwide retail sales have plunged every month so far this year. 
Xu Chi, a Shanghai-based senior strategic analyst with Zhongtai Securities, said some Chinese consumers may prove the  21 Day Habit Theory,  a popular scientific proposition that it only takes that long to establish new habits. 
""We believe people s spending patterns follow the well-known theory, which means most people in China, having been cooped-up at home for more than a month and not having binge-shopped, may break the habit and not return to their old ways,"" Xu said. 
Jiang said she was determined not to return to her free-spending ways and planned to cook more at home.
""I ll turn to cheaper goods for some luxury brands,"" she said. ""I ll choose Huawei s smartphone, because (Apple s) iPhone has too much brand premium.""
Tang, who has recently used 100 yuan of shopping coupons to stock up on food, is going to hold the purse strings even tighter.

""I ve set my monthly budget at 1,000 yuan,"" she said. ""Including one - and just one - bottle of bubble tea."" "

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will start testing its own COVID-19 tracing app on the Isle of Wight from Tuesday, hoping that the technology in combination with more testing and tracking will help limit transmission of the coronavirus. 
It has taken a different approach from other European countries by processing data centrally rather than solely on the devices themselves, where a higher level of privacy can be guaranteed.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday, however, that data privacy and security were paramount in the app s development.
Everyone on the island off the south coast of England, which has a population of about 140,000, will be able to download the app from Thursday, while health service and council staff will have access from Tuesday.
Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 or a positive test, enters their details on the app to start the tracing process.
""By downloading the app, you re protecting your own health, you re protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community,"" Hancock told a news briefing on Monday.
""The pilot is important so we can help make sure the app works as well as it possibly can alongside the contact-tracing system."" 
Countries are rushing to develop apps which, along with a wider testing and tracking programme, are seen as key to easing the social distancing rules that have all but shut global economies.
Britain has opted for a centralised model, whereby a list of contacts made via bluetooth signals are stored on a users  device as anonymous tokens.
If the user says they have symptoms or have tested positive, the list of contacts can be submitted to the app, which analyses the data and notifies devices matching the tokens it deems at risk, for example because of the time the devices were in proximity.
Matthew Gould, Chief Executive Officer the National Health Service s technology group NHSX which developed the app, said they had ""put privacy right at the heart of it"".
""It doesn t know who you are. It doesn t know who you ve been near. It doesn’t know where you are,"" he said.
PRIVACY TRADE OFF
Rival systems, including one proposed by Apple  and Google , match the lists of tokens on the devices themselves, removing the risk of sending data to a centralised server, even if it is anonymised.
Britain s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said on Monday that if she were to start with a blank sheet for an app, decentralised would be on it. 
But she told a committee of lawmakers that did not mean a centralised system could not have the same kind of privacy and security protections.
Gould said centralised technology would be able to give more insights into the virus.
""If privacy was the only thing we were optimising for here, then it may well be that a decentralised approach should be the default choice,"" he said.
But privacy had to be balanced against public health, and a centralised approach gave the potential ""to collect some very important data that gives serious insight into the virus that will help us"".
These included data on which symptoms developed into COVID-19, which contacts were more risky, and the difference, for example, between a contact three days ago and one yesterday.
He added that Britain was talking to international partners and was also working ""phenomenally closely"" with Apple and Google. 

Ideally more than half the population would download the app, he said, but even a level above 20% would give some important insights into how the virus was spreading."

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Monday as increases in large tech and internet companies and oil price gains outweighed concerns about the latest U.S.-China tensions and downbeat sentiment from the annual meeting of Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway.
Major U.S. indexes opened lower but moved higher throughout the afternoon to snap two-day losing streaks.
Stocks have rebounded sharply since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states trying to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Monday capitalized on the Federal Reserve s emergency measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak to issue its cheapest bonds in years, making it the latest blue-chip company to do so to fund stock buybacks and dividends.
Apple s offering illustrates how companies with the best credit ratings are boosting shareholder returns by tapping cheap debt made available through the Fed s backstopping of the credit markets. Apple shares are virtually flat year-to-date, compared with a 12% drop in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). 
The technology company raised $8.5 billion by selling four different bonds with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years. It sold a $2 billion three-year bond and a five-year $2.25 billion with coupons of 0.75% and 1.125% respectively, the lowest rates the company has paid on bonds with such durations since 2013, according to Refinitiv IFR data. 
The coupons on Apple s 10-year and 30-year bonds were also the lowest the company has paid in the past years, according to the Refinitiv data.
The funds will go toward general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and dividend payments, Apple said in a regulatory filing. During the six months ended March 28, Apple spent $38.5 billion to repurchase its own stock. 
The Fed slashed interest rates to almost zero in March and said it would act as buyer of last resort in the investment-grade corporate bond market, in a bid to help cash-strapped companies access capital markets roiled by the economic fallout from the pandemic. 
While the Federal Reserve has yet to buy a single corporate bond, the intervention has fueled record issuance by companies in need of funding, such as  Boeing Co  , Marriott International Inc  and  Ford Motor Co  .
The policy has also allowed financially strong companies such as Apple, which had just over $40 billion in cash as of the end of March, to reduce its cost of capital to the benefit of shareholders.
In the past week, drugmaker Biogen Inc  and U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc  have also sold new bonds at low rates, which the companies said were partly to fund share buybacks. 
Goldman Sachs  & Co, BofA Securities, JPMorgan  and  Morgan Stanley   were joint book-running managers on the Apple bond offering.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  and Alphabet  Inc s Google on Monday said they would ban the use of location tracking in apps that use a new contact tracing system the two are building to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99% of smart phones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The companies plan to allow only public health authorities to use the technology.
Both companies said privacy and preventing governments from using the system to compile data on citizens was a primary goal. The system uses Bluetooth signals from phones to detect encounters and does not use or store GPS location data.
But the developers of official coronavirus-related apps in several U.S. states told Reuters last month it was vital they be allowed to use GPS location data in conjunction with the new contact tracing system to track how outbreaks move and identify hotspots.
The Apple-Google decision to not allow GPS data collection with their contact tracing system will require public health authorities that want to access GPS location to rely on what Apple and Google have described as unstable, battery-draining workarounds.
Alternatives likely would miss some encounters because iPhones and Android devices turn off Bluetooth connections after some time for battery-saving and other reasons unless users remember to re-activate them.
But some apps said they planned to stick to their own approaches.
Software company Twenty, which developed the state of Utah s Healthy Together contact tracing app with both GPS and Bluetooth, said on Monday the app ""operates effectively"" without the new Apple-Google tool.
""If their approach can be more effective than our current solution, we’ll eagerly incorporate their features into our existing application, provided it meets the specifications of current and prospective public health partners,"" Twenty said.
Canada s Alberta province, which does not collect GPS data, said it has no plans to adopt the Apple-Google system for its ABTraceTogether app.
Privacy experts have warned that any cache of location data related to health issues could make businesses and individuals vulnerable to being ostracized if the data is exposed.

Apple and Google also said Monday they will allow only one app per country to use the contact system, to avoid fragmentation and encourage wider adoption. The companies said they would, however, support countries that opt for a state or regional approach, and that U.S. states will be allowed to use the system."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets snapped a three-day losing streak on Tuesday and oil was on its longest run of gains in nine months as moves to ease major economies out of their coronavirus lockdowns lifted sentiment.
It was a turnaround from Monday, when bickering between Washington and Beijing triggered fresh selling, but traders have become used to sudden changes of direction in recent months and there were more to handle in Europe, too.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose nearly 2% early as a more than 6% jump in oil prices boosted oil stocks, only to wilt on news that Germany s top court had ruled the European Central Bank s quantitative-easing programme had ""partially violated"" the country s constitution.
The euro and the region s government debt fell, too, although the court also said the ECB s measures didn t amount to monetary financing -- where a central bank bankrolls the government -- something banned in Germany.
The ruling also didn t apply to the bank s new coronavirus PEPP support programme.
""In practice, this should not restrict the ECB too much,"" said Holger Schmiedling, chief economist at Berenberg. ""However, Karlsruhe (German court) has emphasized that there are limits to bond purchases. This could make it more difficult for the ECB to expand PEPP.""
In addition, euro zone producer prices fell the most in March since the 2008 financial crisis, Eurostat data showed.
The drop was more than expected as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for energy. Prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 1.5% month-on-month in March and 2.8% year-on-year. 
The euro traded down at $1.0889, stocks were up only half of what they had been and a sell-off in bond markets pushed Italy s government yields up past 1.83%.
That meant the U.S. dollar index pushed higher for a second consecutive day, though the big petrocurrencies like Canada s dollar, Norway s crown and Russia s rouble were all with stronger or holding steady. [/FRX]
Several countries, including Spain, Italy, Nigeria, India, and Malaysia, are tentatively easing lockdowns and the governors of California and New York sounded more optimistic on Monday about businesses reopening there.
Brent crude rose 6.5% to $28.97 a barrel, up for a sixth straight day, and U.S. crude rose 9% to $22.24 a barrel for its fifth consecutive rise.
Analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia  said the structure of the oil price rises, with bigger gains in nearer-dated contracts, suggested expectations of more production cuts and a restoration of fuel demand later this year.
They added, though, that this meant prices are unlikely to recover their big declines since the start of the year.
""From a very top-down perspective, markets are reacting positively to measures governments and central banks have taken,"" said Alistair Wittet, a European equity portfolio manager at Comgest.

""But we are still to see what the full economic consequences of all this be... the real test will be when the markets start opening up and governments and central banks start withdrawing (their support)."" "

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, as tensions between China and the U.S. appeared to ease and  more states and corporations looked to reopen for business.
At 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 32 points, or 1.2%, higher, Nasdaq 100 Futures up 110 points, or 1.3%. The Dow futures contract rose 270 points, or 1.2%.
Deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger said late Monday the United States is not considering “punitive measures” against China over its handling of the pandemic.
This contrasted with more aggressive comments over the weekend from the U.S. administration, which had raised fears of another trade war between the two most powerful economies in the world.
Now attention turns to the idea of a return to normalcy, as more and more states look to reopen for business. The latest to do so is New York, the state hardest hit by the pandemic, after Governor Andrew Cuomo Monday outlined seven requirements needed for each region in the state to reopen.
Some areas, including central New York and the sparsely populated North Country section of the state, are already meeting five of the seven requirements, he said. New York City is meeting only three.
Adding to this, Starbucks  announced late Monday that the coffee giant plans to reopen more than 85% of its U.S. stores by the end of this week. Starbucks stock gained 3.1% premarket.
The corporate earnings season continues Tuesday, with Walt  Disney   the leading name, reporting after the bell. The company has been hard hit by the pandemic, with its theme parks unlikely to open until 2021, cruises suspended and advertising on live sporting events on ESPN cancelled. Can the new income stream from Disney+ offset this?
Elsewhere, Apple  will be in the spotlight after the iPhone maker on Monday borrowed $8.5 billion with a four-part bond deal. 
Shares of L Brands  fell more than 7% premarket after the company pulled out of its plan to take Victoria s Secret private, and Hertz  slumped 27% amid reports it could file for bankruptcy as early as this week.
Turning to economic data, the Institute of Supply Management will release its April non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The ISM services index is expected to have plunged to 36.8 last month from 52.5 in March. That would be below the all-time low for the index of 37.3 set in 2008.
Oil futures pushed higher, amid signs the short-term imbalance between supply and demand is easing. The American Petroleum Institute will issue its snapshot of weekly U.S. oil inventories after the bell. Last week’s numbers showed a build of 10 million barrels in crude.
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 9.8% higher at $22.38 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 7.6% to $29.27.."

PARIS (Reuters) - France accused Apple   on Tuesday of undermining its effort to fight the coronavirus by refusing to help make its iPhones more compatible with a planned ""StopCovid"" contact-tracing app.
Countries are rushing to develop smartphone apps, which are seen as a way to help keep the novel coronavirus epidemic in check while reopening the economy.
The apps would use the Bluetooth feature that allows phones to interact with nearby devices to help detect when users come into contact with people who potentially carry the virus.
Apple s iPhones normally block access to Bluetooth unless the user is actively running an app. French officials want Apple to change the settings to let their app access Bluetooth in the background, so it is always on. So far, they say, Apple has refused.
""Apple could have helped us make the application work even better on the iPhone. They have not wished to do so,"" France s minister for digital technology, Cedric O, told BFM Business TV.
""I regret this, given that we are in a period where everyone is mobilised to fight against the epidemic, and given that a large company that is doing so well economically is not helping out a government in this crisis.""
""We will remember that when time comes,"" the minister added.
A spokesman for Apple in France declined to comment.
The issue of Bluetooth access on iPhones is one of several security-related questions that have arisen as countries try to roll out smartphone apps to fight the coronavirus.
France, along with some other countries, wants to keep contact data in a central database, arguing this would make it easier for the authorities to track suspected coronavirus cases.
Apple and Alphabet s  Google, between them responsible for the operating systems on nearly all smartphones, want data to be stored on the phones themselves, out of government reach, saying this would better protect the privacy of users.
O, the French minister, said he could not explain the reasoning behind Apple s decision on Bluetooth.
""We consider that oversight of the healthcare system, fighting the coronavirus, is a matter for governments and not necessarily for big American companies,"" he said.
The French minister said the app should be ready to be deployed on June 2 regardless of Apple s stance, and would enter a testing phase in the week of May 11 when the country starts to unwind its lockdown.
In France, Apple s mobile operating system accounted for 21.1% of the market in the first quarter, while Google s Android accounted for 78.8%, according to Kantar research.

Britain, which is using the same centralised approach as France to store data, will start testing its own COVID-19 tracing app on the Isle of Wight from Tuesday."

The company in March decided to make the conference, which is usually held in San Jose, California and attracts more than 5,000 attendees, an online-only event due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Technology giants  Facebook Inc  ,  Microsoft Corp   and Alphabet  Inc s Google have also canceled or moved their software developer conferences online due to the pandemic."

(Reuters) - Wall Street s main indexes jumped on Tuesday as a recovery in oil prices lifted battered energy stocks and a slew of countries eased coronavirus-induced restrictions in an attempt to revive their economies.
Some hard-hit countries, including Italy, as well as a handful of U.S. states are tentatively easing stay-at-home orders this week, raising hopes for a recovery in oil demand.
All the major S&P 500 sub-indexes were trading higher, with the energy sector (SPNY) rising 2.4%, but the index is a big laggard across sectors with a 36.6% decline this year.
Healthcare stocks (SPXHC) were also in the spotlight with  Pfizer  Inc  up 2.8% after it announced a venture with its German partner had started delivering doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccines for human testing in the United States.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  jumped 5.6% as it said its experimental antibody cocktail for COVID-19 may be available for use by the end of summer or fall, as it ramps up efforts to start human trials in June.
Market-leading growth stocks such as  Microsoft Corp  , Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc  provided the biggest boost for a second day.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has climbed about 30% from its March lows on the back of unprecedented stimulus measures and signs of a plateau in new COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world.
""We are in the hope mode regarding the rebound that will come once the economies reopen,"" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for  Northern Trust   in Chicago.
However, many market experts have warned the rally could be tested amid a risk of another wave of virus infections and with growing evidence of the damage to the economy and corporate America.
Data on Tuesday showed the domestic services sector recorded its first contraction in nearly 10-1/2-years, while the Institute for Supply Management s (ISM) non-manufacturing index showed a smaller-than-expected decline.
Investors are now bracing for data on the labor market through the week with expectations of another staggering initial jobless claims reading on Wednesday and nonfarm payrolls for the month of April due Friday. 
""It s all about the mood swings and hopes of the economies reopening. But the problem is this could change once we get to see some of the hard numbers, especially the employment report,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
At 12:51 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 339.42 points, or 1.43%, at 24,089.18, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 47.99 points, or 1.69%, at 2,890.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 161.46 points, or 1.85%, at 8,872.18. 

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 3.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.54-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded eight new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and four new lows."

The hardware to detect irregular beats is present in FitBit s devices, but is not available to consumers. Device users who enroll in the study will be allowed to test it in order for Fitbit to seek regulatory review.
Fitbit, which is being acquired by Google-parent Alphabet  Inc, said in October that it planned to develop https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fitbit-health/fitbit-in-healthcare-partnership-to-take-on-apple-watch-idUSKBN1WW263 a method to detect irregular heartbeats that would match the feature available on rival Apple Inc  s Watch.
At the time, Fitbit said it would partner with the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance on how to communicate with patients about the condition, but did not say when it would begin trials to gain approval from health authorities in the United States and elsewhere for its detection algorithm.
Fitbit said the study announced Wednesday will fill that purpose and generate data for its regulatory submissions around the world. The study will be led by Steven Lubitz, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
It is open to individuals in the United States who are over 22 years of age over and own Fitbit devices that can track heart rates, such as the ""Ionic"" and ""Versa"" models. Fitbit aims to enroll hundreds of thousands of people for the study.

Contact tracing involves identifying, testing and isolating people exposed to the virus before they spread it to others, something that governments globally have said is vital to keep their economies safely opened until a vaccine exists. Apps that tap the Bluetooth sensors in smartphones to detect encounters with those who test positive could speed the process, experts say.
But some governments that planned to forge ahead with such apps without the help of the American technology giants have been forced to reverse course. The head of Australia s contact-tracing app told senators on Tuesday his team is moving to the Apple-Google technology over a glitchy internal solution, and the government agency behind the U.K. s forthcoming app disclosed in a contract signed on Tuesday that it is asking engineers to test the Apple-Google system amid privacy concerns about its previously planned alternative.
The decisions have wide ramifications for using smartphone apps to log encounters between people to make it easier to find and alert those who crossed paths with a virus-carrier. 
Apple and Google have said their Bluetooth-based technology will work more smoothly than alternatives and be trusted by consumers wary of government surveillance, with the companies banning government collection of app users  GPS location and other personal data. Several governments including France, the United Kingdom and some U.S. states contend Apple and Google s rules to protect privacy prevent the robust data analysis needed to slow the virus  spread.
But Colombia s struggle to use alternative technology highlights the challenges that await governments reluctant to accept Apple s and Google s terms.
""There have certainly been several lessons learned in this process,"" Colombia presidential adviser Victor Munoz told Reuters.
ROADBLOCKS ON IPHONES
The Colombian government had felt well on its way with its CoronApp, which had been downloaded by 4.3 million people as of May 2 and also includes features to report symptoms and see where cases are located on a map.
But the CoronApp dropped its contact tracing feature last month just days after launching it. 
Apple and Google, the leading makers of smartphone operating systems, allow government contact tracing apps to bypass their technology. But without it, iPhones do not send a readable Bluetooth signal while locked, a feature designed to prevent tracking and save battery life. 
Contact tracing apps are useless unless at least about half of a population downloads them, and iPhone usage is too substantial in most countries to be ignored.
So CoronApp used alternative technology from Portuguese company HypeLabs, which sells networking technology to gaming apps and other businesses, that purports to overcome the iPhone Bluetooth limitation.
But Munoz said Colombia encountered multiple challenges with the contact tracing feature that relied on HypeLabs, including inaccuracies in logging contacts using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
Colombia needed a better way to ""minimize the risk of generating unnecessary alerts"" and decided to align CoronApp with the Apple-Google technology instead, Munoz added.
His team had met representatives of Apple and Google and was studying their technology, he said.
""It s very important to us that we evaluate any alternative that can help the government make better decisions,"" Munoz said.
HypeLabs said it remains in discussions with several other countries.
Randall Brugeaud, chief executive of Australia’s Digital Transformation Agency, said on Tuesday that the country’s COVIDSafe app increasingly struggles to log encounters the longer an iPhone remains locked. 
""The big shift in performance of Bluetooth connectivity will be the point we’re able to leverage the new Apple-Google Bluetooth management software,"" he told senators.
Apple and Google last month began working on a joint solution to the connectivity problem between devices. But their offering, which will not be available for use until mid-May, restricts governments from amassing databases of people s movements.
Colombia is one of several governments that has been hoping to gather such location data for use detecting coronavirus hotspots where businesses may need to be shut down or deep cleaned. 
APPLE-GOOGLE COULD FALL SHORT
Other developers are moving ahead to build contact tracing apps without Apple-Google technology. The Silicon Valley giants are authorizing their tools only for government contact-tracing apps. But several developers told Reuters they are fielding requests from large businesses that want apps for their workplaces.
""We’ve talked to a pro sports team, companies in the food supply chain, a car dealership, nonprofits,"" said Jamison Day, founder of Safe2, an app that uses HypeLabs  technology to enable exposure notification.
Using only Bluetooth also could fall short, experts said. The coronavirus can spread through shared objects such as tables, and two people who sit in the same spot an hour apart would not be picked up by the Apple-Google Bluetooth system, said Aarathi Prasad, a professor of computer science at Skidmore College.
Privacy activists have praised the protections introduced by Apple and Google, noting legitimate concerns exist about how data from contact tracing apps could be misused by governments.
Whether consumers trust elected officials or Apple and Google to better safeguard data collected by contact tracing remains a major question, with answers varying globally.
HypeLabs co-founder Carlos Lei said he continues to field inquiries from government officials, whom he declined to name, who have reservations about embracing Apple and Google.

""When it s an entire world looking into a problem, it s always better than having just one or two private companies looking into it,"" Lei told Reuters."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  said on Thursday that it was awarding $10 million to a maker of nasal swabs and other materials for collecting samples for Covid-19 tests in a move aimed at boosting the swab maker s production to 1 million collection kits per week by early July.
The two companies said the award would help Murrieta, California-based COPAN Diagnostics expand into a larger facility and create 50 new jobs in Southern California. In addition to providing the funding, Apple said it would help COPAN Diagnostics design and source new equipment from York, Pennsylvania-based K2 Kinetics and Waukesha, Wisconsin-based MWES, both makers of industrial robotics systems.
Shortages of collection kits and testing supplies have slowed efforts to track the spread of the novel coronavirus in the United States. The corporate parent of COPAN Diagnostics, COPAN Group, is based in the Lombardy region of Italy, one of the worst-hit regions in the world during the pandemic, and stepped up production as demand surged. 
In California, COPAN Diagnostics makes specialized nasal swabs to collect samples for Covid-19 tests, along with vials and sterile media used to transport those swabs to labs for testing. The companies said Apple s help would expand production of sample kits destined for U.S. hospitals from a current several thousand per week to more than one million kits per week by early July.
In a statement, Norman Sharples, chief executive of COPAN Diagnostics, said Apple s ""teams are already making a huge difference with our efforts to scale up the production of our sample collection and transport kits.”
Apple did not specify the nature of the funding but made the award from a $5 billion advanced manufacturing fund. The iPhone maker previously used the fund to support expansions and research at its suppliers, such as Corning  Inc, which makes glass for iPhones, and II-VI  Inc-owned Finisar, which makes chips for Apple s face recognition sensors.

“We feel a deep sense of responsibility to do everything we can to help medical workers, patients, and communities support the global response to COVID-19,” Jeff Williams , Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement."

BERLIN (Reuters) - A European coalition is forming around an approach to using smartphone technology to trace coronavirus infections that, its backers hope, could help to reopen borders without unleashing a second wave of the pandemic.
As countries rush to develop apps that would use Bluetooth short-range wireless to identify those who have come into contact with people infected with the virus, controversy has erupted over how best to handle the personal data they collect.
Britain and France argue people should trust their health authorities to hold such information on a central computer server. A loose coalition of other nations, led by Switzerland and including Germany and Italy, believe data should be kept only on handsets so that it would be impossible for governments to spy on their citizens.
Crucially for the coalition, its approach is compatible with that of U.S. technology giants Apple  and Alphabet s  Google, whose iOS and Android operating systems run 99% of the world s smartphones.
Apple has, on privacy grounds, erected a roadblock to centralized apps by preventing the Bluetooth Low Energy function on its iPhones from monitoring other devices while running in the background.
That means for such apps to work, they would need to be open while the phone is unlocked - a pain for the user and a drain on the battery. Attempted workarounds have proven to be unreliable.
Supporters of the phone-based approach from Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland this week backed a roadmap https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mGfE7rMKNmc51TG4ceE9PHEggN8rHOXk/view to enable national apps to  talk  to each other and handle infections when people travel abroad.
""Everything about these projects has from Day One been about how we can make it work on an international level,"" said Marcel Salathe, a digital epidemiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.
INTERNATIONAL DEBATE
The standards row has been compared by German Health Minister Jens Spahn to a ""war of religion"". It also has major ramifications for Europe, a patchwork of over 40 nations where lockdowns have brought cross-border travel to a near standstill.
It is also playing out in other parts of the world.
Colombia has removed the contact-tracing feature in its official app for informing residents about the coronavirus after experiencing glitches, but aims to rebuild using the Apple-Google technology.
In Europe, Salathe is a leading voice in an initiative called DP-3T https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/DP3T%20White%20Paper.pdf that has brought together Swiss and other European researchers to develop a decentralized app whose guiding principle is that it should be trusted by the public and not limited to one geography.
""Interoperability of proximity tracing apps across borders is crucial,"" said Cas Cremers of the CISPA cybersecurity institute, brought to advise on Germany s app plan after Berlin recently switched to the  decentralized  camp.
Of the European coalition, only Austria has so far rolled out an app. Stopp Corona, developed by Accenture  for the Red Cross, has been downloaded 570,000 times and is being tweaked to run on a decentralized architecture. 
A Swiss prototype has undergone trials with army volunteers to see whether it can detect close encounters lasting more than five minutes - a risk event that would trigger a push notification to call a doctor or self-isolate.
SIGN UP OR ELSE
Researchers at Oxford University say that 60% of people need to sign up to apps to achieve the tracing levels needed to help defeat COVID-19. 
Although such apps can be useful at lower levels of takeup, this has led some governments that have already launched them, including Australia, to link further steps to ease lockdowns to the number of downloads.
That approach is anathema to the decentralizers and privacy advocates. They say any discrimination -- for example making access to a workplace contingent on using an app -- should be illegal.
Adopting proximity tracing apps should be seen as an act of altruism to help protect others from infection, argues Carmela Troncoso, a computer scientist at Lausanne who has been involved in designing and coding DP-3T.
Troncoso acknowledged that defending privacy entailed trade-offs in terms of utility when compared to the intrusive surveillance used by China and South Korea to trace and chase infections. That, however, is the point.
""This is a very big bet: We hope this will allow us to better control the spread of the virus so that we can go back to normal life,"" Troncoso told Reuters.

""But it s very hard to say that it will work. All the more reason not to create a new, invasive technology."""

Invesco  QQQ Trust Series 1, which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, is poised to hit that closing milestone for the first time since it began trading in 1999. It’s already hit that level in regular market hours. The ETF extended a rally from its March low to over 30% on Thursday as a broader tech-heavy gauge erased its year-to-date drop amid gains in giants such as Apple Inc .,  Microsoft Corp  . and  Facebook Inc  .
Read: Nasdaq Composite Erases 2020 Losses as Big Earnings Drive Gains
Investors are picking technology as a safe corner at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is causing so many uncertainties for global markets. Tech behemoths, known for their strong balance sheets and high growth, have counterbalanced the gloom and doom affecting many other industries. With millions of people around the world stuck in their home offices to help contain the outbreak, companies that specialize in remote-working products are becoming a hot spot.
“It’s a sector now that’s just resilient,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade . “The conditions we’re in right now, companies need to keep operating -- they just need to do it remotely. And that benefits a lot of these tech companies.”
While the Nasdaq Composite Index turned green for 2020 on Thursday, broader gauges such as the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average remained lower for the year by at least 10%. All three major benchmarks have surged from their March lows, but technology is the only S&P 500 group that’s up for 2020.
That preference for tech is visible in the ETF world. After posting its best month of inflows since 2001 in March, QQQ added another $3.2 billion in April and $367 million so far in May. The fund rose 1.6% at 2:17 p.m. in New York -- on track for its highest close since Feb. 21.
“Investors may recognize that the constituents of QQQ’s benchmark, the Nasdaq 100, are well positioned to capitalize on the current shift to digital working and learning, potential advancements in biotech and healthcare along with a number of transformative, long-term themes in the marketplace,” said Ryan McCormack, Invesco QQQ strategist.
Only four other ETFs are currently above $100 billion -- SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY ; iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, or IVV; Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, or VTI; and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or VOO.
Despite QQQ’s rally, traders are increasingly looking to bet against the fund. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on QQQ -- a rough indicator of bearish bets on the fund -- climbed to 5.1% on Wednesday, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s up from about 2.7% on March 23.
“The thing we haven’t seen yet with tech names is how badly advertising is going to be hit,” said Marc Odo, client portfolio manager at Swan Global Investments. “Those companies are going to have to plug the gaps or their earnings are going to take a hit.”
Still, solid first-quarter earnings from Google parent Alphabet  Inc., Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla  Inc. have contributed to momentum -- at least for now."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A greater portion of borrowers in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc s  consumer business had less-than-stellar credit scores in the first quarter, indicating that the bank s rapid expansion into Main Street lending may be hitting a bump in the road. 
The percentage of customers with Goldman credit cards or loans from its online bank Marcus who had FICO scores below 660 rose to 18% as of March 31, up from 15% at the end of last year, according to a securities filing last week. A score above 670 indicates a borrower can reliably pay debts on time, while a score between 580 and 669 is shakier, according to creditcards.com. 
Goldman has been careful not to grow its consumer portfolio too much in recent months, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down major economies and put millions of people out of work, executives have said. That suggests the decline in credit quality is because borrowers the bank targeted many months ago experienced some financial hardships that dinged their credit scores, said D.A. Davidson analyst David Konrad. 
While Marcus remains a tiny part of Goldman Sachs, it attracts attention on Wall Street because Chief Executive David Solomon has made growing consumer deposits and lending a key pillar in his turnaround strategy for the bank. 
""It will likely slow down part of (Goldman s) transformational strategic plan, given the shock to the economy,"" Konrad said. 
The total balance of loans and credit card balances Goldman held was $6.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $6.6 billion in the fourth quarter last year, the only two quarters for which the bank has disclosed this information. 
Marcus offers a joint credit card with Apple Inc , as well as installment loans marketed for paying off credit card debt. Although the business has grown quickly since its launch in 2015, its loan book is largely uncollateralized, making it vulnerable to sharp economic downturns. 
U.S. gross domestic product declined at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since late 2008. Since March 21, some 33.5 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment benefits. Goldman s chief financial officer, Stephen Scherr, said on a call with analysts last month that the bank will slow growth in consumer lending ""as we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation."""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A court asked the Indian government on Friday to respond to a challenge against its order for compulsory use of a contact tracing app by public and private sector employees returning to work amid the world s biggest coronavirus lockdown.
India launched the Aarogya Setu, or ""Health Bridge"", app last month. Downloaded to the phones of 94 million Indians, it makes use of Bluetooth and GPS to alert users who may have encountered people who later test positive for the virus.
But mandatory use of the app forces a user to ""give away data to a system which he may or may not approve of, thereby attacking his right of informational autonomy,"" a member of the opposition Congress party said in a petition to the high court in the southern state of Kerala.
""Such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information from an individual is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and it is attribute of a dictatorial system,"" said the petition, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.
The court has fixed a hearing on May 12.
India s technology ministry did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters to seek comment.
The app was initially available only on smartphones running on Google s  Android and Apple s  iPhones, leaving out nearly 400 million people who use only basic feature phones.
Officials at the tech ministry and a lawyer who framed the app s privacy policy have said it needs to be on at least 200 million phones to be effective among a population of 1.3 billion.
Now, seeking to widen its use, New Delhi plans to launch within days a version for mobile carrier Reliance Jio s $9 internet-enabled phones, Reuters has reported.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better target health efforts, the tech ministry said in late April, adding that information would be used ""only for administering necessary medical interventions"".
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe privacy as data is collected anonymously.
As India scales back in low-risk zones the shutdown that began on March 25, it has vowed to hold company heads responsible for ensuring that all returning workers use the app.
Digital rights activists have criticised the order as a violation of the principle of consent. Critics, including a French hacker, have raised privacy concerns and want the app s source code made public, but the government says it is safe.
App use should be mandatory only in containment zones, Delhi-based think tank the Dialogue told the government, calling for independent data auditing to preserve checks and balances.
Many nations are using similar apps but some, such as Australia and Colombia, are turning to technology from Apple and Alphabet s Google amid citizens  privacy concerns and glitchy state-backed systems.
India has reported 37,916 virus infections and 1,886 deaths.

(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc  is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection as soon as next week with plans to permanently close about a quarter of its roughly 850 stores, becoming the latest major U.S. retailer to succumb to fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the matter.
A bankruptcy filing would cap a long decline for the iconic 118-year-old department store chain, which struggled with a nearly $4-billion debt load and competition from e-commerce firms and discount brick-and-mortar retailers even before the pandemic s onset.
The Plano, Texas-based company, which employs nearly 85,000 people, is in discussions with creditors for a so-called debtor-in-possession loan to bolster its finances while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings, the sources said. The loan could total between $400 million and $500 million, some of the sources said.
The timing of a bankruptcy filing could slip depending on how much time it gets from creditors, the sources said. J.C. Penney skipped a $17 million debt payment Thursday and only has five days to make good on it before defaulting. A 30-day grace period on a $12 million payment the company skipped April 15 ends next Friday.
J.C. Penney has not made a final decision on how to address its strained finances, and is also considering alternatives that include negotiating a deal with creditors outside of bankruptcy court or obtaining additional financing, the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.
J.C. Penney declined to comment.
While J.C. Penney aims to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy protection, it plans to permanently shutter roughly 200 stores, a figure that could fluctuate depending on negotiations with creditors, the sources said.
Under one plan being discussed, J.C. Penney would emerge from bankruptcy as two separate companies, the sources said. One would own some of the company s real estate and serve as a landlord to the other entity operating the retailer s business, they said. Creditors, many of them Wall Street hedge funds, would control the businesses in exchange for forgiving debt, they said. 
J.C. Penney s online sales have not been enough to compensate for the significant losses it has incurred while keeping stores closed across the United States in response to lockdowns aimed at curbing spread of the coronavirus.
While the company has enough cash to survive in the coming months, it faces a $105 million debt payment due in June and about $300 million of annual interest expenses. More than $2 billion of debt comes due in 2023. 
J.C. Penney Chief Executive Jill Soltau told customers in a Thursday email that stores have started to gradually reopen with precautions such as Plexiglass shields at registers and limited crowds. 
Retailers are bearing a significant brunt of the economic fallout from the pandemic as sales all but evaporate. Just this week, luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus Group and clothing retailer J. Crew Group Inc filed for bankruptcy protection. 
In April, the U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs, the steepest plunge since the Great Depression, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
IN NEED OF TURNAROUND
J.C. Penney opened its first store in Wyoming in 1902 and called it ""The Golden Rule,"" a reference to what the retailer saw as its standard for customer service, according to its website.
The e-commerce revolution that took hold in the 21st century eroded J.C. Penney s business much as it did other traditional retailers . The company now also faces fierce competition from discount chains including TJX Cos Inc’s  Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
J.C. Penney spent years trying to recover from a failed transformation spearheaded by former CEO Ron Johnson, the one-time pioneer of Apple Inc s  retail stores. 
Johnson launched expensive renovations of J.C. Penney locations and eliminated coupons, resulting in a customer backlash that led to plunging sales. He was replaced in 2013, and a revolving door of executives followed before Soltau took the helm in late 2018.
J.C. Penney had recently made some strides in its turnaround attempt, meeting or exceeding guidance on financial objectives for 2019 and improving sales at some stores. 
Before the pandemic, J.C. Penney hoped to persuade creditors to give it more financial breathing room, as Soltau tried to forge a turnaround focused on the company s roots as a seller of affordable apparel for middle class families.

But discussions with creditors earlier this year did not win J.C. Penney any concessions, the sources said. The coronavirus outbreak prompted the company to draw $1.25 billion from its revolving credit line and eventually start making bankruptcy preparations. "

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants such as Facebook  and Amazon  could face tougher rules as European Union regulators seek evidence to curb their role as gatekeepers to the internet and access to people, information and services, according to an EU tender seen by Reuters.
The outcome could force Facebook, Google , Amazon and Apple  to separate their competing businesses, provide rivals access to their data and open up their standards to them.
The European Commission, which in February said it was considering legislation against large online platforms acting as gatekeepers, has put out a 600,000-euro ($649,800) tender for a study to gather evidence of such gatekeeping power.
The study should look into self-preferencing practices and the possibility of forcing dominant companies to separate their businesses, the tender said, citing Amazon which is both a retailer and a market place operator, and app developer and App Store operator Apple.
""A general, automatic rule could prohibit or restrict any differentiated treatment by those platforms when they are vertically integrated, to separate clearly their roles as organisers of the marketplace and as a competitor on these marketplaces,"" the tender document read.
Tech giants with vast troves of data and unwilling to share them with smaller rivals may be required by regulatory measures to offer access on reasonable, standardized and non-discriminatory terms, the document said. 
The study should also focus on tech companies  use of data from one market to expand into other markets, making it difficult for current or new rivals to compete, the paper said, citing the example of Facebook and its Whatsapp unit.
Another area of interest is information asymmetries characterised by social media platforms and search engines amassing vast amounts of data via free services, resulting in users reluctant to switch to a competing company.
Specialist news agency MLex first reported about the tender.
The study s wide remit is alarming, said Kayvan Hazemi-Jebelli, lawyer for lobbying group Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA).
""The powers the Commission is looking into under the proposal would give it wide discretion to protect not just competition, but favoured competitors,"" he said.
""Unilaterally departing from the existing global competition law framework in this way would create an uneven playing field, and risks depriving Europeans  access to beneficial services and functionalities.""
The Commission s directorate-general for communications and technology expects an interim report in three months and a final report in five months.

Investing.com –  The Dow rallied into the close Friday, ending positively for the time in three weeks as investors bet on a comeback in the jobs market following data showing a record loss of jobs last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.91%, the S&P 500 gained 1.69%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.58%. The Nasdaq turned positive for the year earleir this week after bouncing off lows seen in March,
Nonfarm payrolls dropped by 20.5 million last month and the unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that was not as bad as many had feared, with economists  forecasting 22 million jobs lost in April and an unemployment rate of 16%.
The bulk of the job losses were temporary and are expected to return as stay-at-home orders are gradually lifted and businesses start to open, according to Jefferies .
""The good news is that our base case is that employment contracts modestly in May and returns to growth in June as businesses reopen and laid-off workers begin to return to work,"" Jefferies said in note. ""We think it will take roughly two years to return to pre-COVID19 employment levels.""
The strength of the rally was underscored by a muted reaction to reports that the Trump administration has paused talks on plans to roll out another coronavirus stimulus package as parts of the country begin to gradually lift restrictions that had weighed on economic activity.
Rising energy stocks, meanwhile, led the broader market rally as oil prices settled 5% higher for a second-straight weekly climb amid ongoing hopes that the reopening of economies and output cuts by major oil-producing nations will stem in the glut in crude supplies.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors digested mixed quarterly performance from corporates.
Uber  rose 5.91% after the ride-hailing company reported a bigger-than-expected loss, but reassured investors that the Covid-19 pandemic would set its path to profitability back by quarters rather than years.
The company previously said it expected to turn a profit in the fourth quarter of the year.
 Roku   fell 8% as it warned growth in its ad business was expected to fall short of its initial expectations and reported mixed first-quarter results amid a surge in costs.
After reporting first-quarter earnings that missed estimates, Walt  Disney   climbed 3.4% after it sold out all tickets for the reopening of Shanghai Disneyland on Monday.
Supporting a climb in tech, Apple  rose 2.4% after announcing it would reopen soe stores in four U.S. states starting next week, albeit with restrictions on capacity.   "

OAKLAND, California (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to launch an app this month to enable people in under-resourced countries to assess whether they may have the novel coronavirus, and is considering a Bluetooth-based contact tracing feature too, an official told Reuters on Friday.
The app will ask people about their symptoms and offer guidance on whether they may have COVID-19, the potentially lethal illness caused by the coronavirus, said Bernardo Mariano, chief information officer for the WHO. Other information, such as how to get tested, will be personalized according to the user s country.
Though the WHO will release a version on app stores globally, any government will be able to take the app s underlying technology, add features and release its own version on app stores, Mariano said in a phone interview.
India, Australia and the United Kingdom already have released official virus apps using their own technology, with common features including telling people whether to get tested based on their symptoms and logging people s movements to enable more efficient contact tracing. 
Several countries are ramping up contact tracing, or the process of finding, testing and isolating individuals who crossed paths with an infectious individual. It is seen as vital to safely opening economies, and apps that automate parts of the process could accelerate efforts.
The WHO expects its app to draw interest in other countries, including some in South America and Africa where case numbers are rising. They may lack the technology and engineers to develop apps or be struggling to offer testing and education.
""The value is really for countries that do not have anything,"" Mariano said. ""We would be leaving behind the ones that are not able to (provide an app), that have fragile health systems.""
Engineers and designers, including some who previously worked at Alphabet  Inc s Google and  Microsoft Corp  , have been volunteering for weeks to develop the new app with about five of them overseeing the process. They are designing it open-source on the hosting service GitHub, meaning code is open to public input. 
Several team members declined to comment.
Mariano said he wants to include additional tools beyond the symptom checker, including a self-help guide for mental health care.
The team also is considering what the WHO refers to as proximity tracing.
Engineers have done preliminary work and talked to smartphone operating system makers Apple Inc  and Google about possibly adopting technology the companies plan to release jointly this month to make tracing easier. 
The technology relies on virtual ""handshakes"" between phones that come within a few feet of each other for at least five minutes. Phones keep anonymized logs of such encounters, allowing someone who later tests positive to anonymously send notifications to recent contacts about their possible exposure to the virus. 
But Mariano said legal and privacy considerations have prevented the WHO from committing to such a feature yet. He expressed concern about the many businesses pitching proximity tools turning around and using any personal data they gather to generate revenue later.
""We want to make sure we ring-fence all the risks around it,"" he said. 
Apple and Google have said their system will not use any data for other purposes and will be stopped when the pandemic ends.
The WHO plans to release guidance as soon as next week on issues countries should consider as they weigh their own proximity tracing apps.
To reach people with limited internet access, the WHO is working to deliver information via text messages. In March, it launched an account on  Facebook Inc   s WhatsApp to provide users with information about the coronavirus, and it partnered with the company s Free Basics program to make some information available without users incurring data charges.

The WHO also plans to release an app next week to inform health workers globally about best practices for donning protective gear, washing hands and treating the virus. The organization already has a general app, WHO Info, that largely mirrors its website."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  said Friday it will reopen a handful of stores in four U.S. states starting next week, in the first resumption of physical retail operations since the iPhone maker shuttered all U.S. stores in mid-March. 
The company said it will open ""some"" stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho and South Carolina. Apple has two stores in both South Carolina and Alabama but did not say which would open. Its Boise, Idaho location will open Monday, with others to follow later in the week.
Apple executives have said they are examining local health data at the county and city level in each community where the company has physical stores to determine when to reopen. Apple has locations in several U.S. states, such as Texas and Georgia, where state rules would in theory allow it to reopen stores, but it has not yet announced plans to do so.
""Our team is constantly monitoring local heath data and government guidance, and as soon as we can safely open our stores, we will,"" Apple said in a statement.
In the four states where Apple stores will reopen, new procedures will be in place similar to those in countries such as South Korea, Australia and Austria, where stores have already reopened.
Customers and employees will be required to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the stores, and Apple will provide a mask if customers do not have their own. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of customers in the store at one time, which Apple said could create delays for walk-in customers.
""With many working and learning from home, our primary focus will be providing service and support,"" Apple said. ""We recommend, where possible, customers buy online for contactless delivery or in-store pick-up.""
Apple will still have demonstration devices for customers to handle in the store, but staff will clean them often, and hand sanitizer dispensers will be placed in stores.

Apple earlier on Friday said it would reopen stores in Germany. The company started shuttering its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. Days later, Apple closed all stores outside mainland China as the virus moved around the globe. Stores began reopening outside the Greater China region in mid-April with its store in South Korea."

Investing.com - Wall Street ended the week with another strong gain as investors managed to shrug off the worst drop in nonfarm payrolls ever.
The Nasdaq Composite turned positive for the year this week, with tech stocks remaining a particular point of strength. And sentiment looks strong as earnings season winds down and states across the U.S. begin to reopen their economies.
But has the rally got legs as summer approaches?
Yasin Ebrahim contends that the Federal Reserve will do whatever it takes to support the economy and for the foreseeable future equities remain the only game in town.
Kim Khan argues that the rally looks narrow, the employment picture will worsen and the days of tax cuts are in the rearview mirror. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the jobs markets and left many businesses on the brink of financial ruin. But the pandemic s grip on equity markets has seemingly been short-lived as swashbuckling gains have followed on Wall Street since the March 23 lows.
Pointing to the disconnect between underlying economic conditions and surging equity markets, many are scrambling for answers at a time when the ultimate economic cure – a Covid-19 vaccine - is still some ways off.
But for others the explanation is simple: the Federal Reserve.
The most powerful central bank in all the land has cut rates within a quarter percentage point of zero and pledged to do whatever it takes to ensure that an eventual economic recovery is robust.
The Fed has expanded its asset purchases beyond Treasuries to include investment-grade debt, municipal bonds, ETFs and junk bonds, helping to stabilize credit markets and lay a softer landing for the coronavirus-ravaged economy.
The spending so far has taken the Fed s balance sheet to nearly $7 trillion, with the central bank recently conceding that it would need to more to support the economy.
The unprecedent move into unconventional markets and unrelenting support from the Fed has strengthened the narrative that the Fed will do whatever takes to support the economy.
""Don t fight the Fed,""  Morgan Stanley   said in a recent note. ""This move (the Fed s $2.3 trillion stimulus) is in-line with our prior view that investors should have no doubt about the Fed’s resolve to do whatever it takes to make sure the recession does not turn into a depression.""
Beyond the Fed, Congress has also ensured the well of stimulus remains deep, rolling out about $2.4 trillion in coronavirus aid to support individuals and businesses impacted from the coronavirus crisis.
Equities -- The Only Game in Town
With U.S. rates currently languishing at near zero and expected to turn negative next year, sitting in cash is not attractive, so equities remain the only game in town.
""(T)here would be no other place for these cash balances to go than chasing equities and bonds in the world as the need for precautionary savings subsides over time,"" JPMorgan  said.
But the flows into equities are not indiscriminate. Unsurprisingly, it is the FAANGs -- Facebook , Apple , Amazon , Netflix , Google-Parent Alphabet  -- and others like Microsoft , Zoom  and Slack  that are best suited to the current pandemic and beyond that are attracting attention.
While stimulus has played the biggest role in the most recent rally, the gradual lifting of restrictions across the country has underpinned hopes the economy has weathered the worst of the pandemic.
""We expect GDP to grow ... as firms and households learn to combine higher economic activity with continued virus control via a range of adjustment mechanisms including mask and glove wearing, frequent cleanings of workplaces, lower office and retail occupancy, and improved testing and contact tracing,"" Goldman Sachs  said.
Without a coronavirus vaccine the possibility of a second wave of infections could threaten the current rally, but for the time being traders are willing to bet the Federal Reserve “put” will remain in place until a Covid-19 vaccine is found.
 
The Bear Case
Investors should beware the bubble. Not an asset-price bubble bears usually speak about, but an economic bubble.
This rally has happened in a bubble where the economy had to be shut down, but the Federal Reserve and the federal government provided an unprecedented backstop. As state governments attempt to reopen and the limitations of that backstop are evident, a lot of valuations will be called into question.
Investors will always be reluctant to fight the Fed, especially one providing historically large liquidity and with a fed funds rate tilting to negative for the first time. But the unprecedented action isn’t creating unprecedented enthusiasm.
“While hedge funds have responded to lower prices by their equity exposure from the lows of late last year, they have gone back only to a neutral allocation,” Andrea Cicione, Head of Strategy, at TS Lombard said in a note this week. “And both institutional and individual investors remain somewhat bearish.”
Breadth shows wavering conviction as well. The percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average is 20%, compared with 70% to 80% last year when the S&P  was around the same level, Cicione noted.
The current high equity prices also seem to be dismissing the seismic shift that’s happened to the economy, pricing in a V-shaped recovery where the angle of the V is approaching 0 degrees and things are reverting back to how they were in no time.
Friday’s employment report brought into sharp relief the pandemic economy landscape. The BLS reported that 20.5 million jobs were lost last month and the jobless rate spiked to 14.7%.
Jobless claims figures gave investors a good idea of what to expect, but stocks have still rallied. A lot of that may have to do with expectations of a sharp rebound by both investors and those recently out of work.
About 77% of laid-off or furloughed workers expect to be rehired by their previous employer, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll out this week. But economists aren’t so optimistic. The Post also noted that a report from the University of Chicago’s Becker Friedman Institute predicted that 42% of job losses from the pandemic will be permanent, with businesses closing and spending curtailed sharply even after reopening.
Meanwhile things could still deteriorate. The Minneapolis Fed’s Neel Kashkari said Thursday the true unemployment rate could be as high as 24% and the recovery will be “slow”.
The new landscape will likely also feature something to which Wall Street is especially averse: higher taxes.
The Treasury is borrowing a record $3 trillion this month to pay for the stimulus programs launched to stabilize the economy. And there could be more programs to come if Republicans and Democrats can agree."

James Li, a public relations account director, would rather spend an hour sitting in Beijing traffic than risk 30 minutes exposed to crowds on a train. “Traffic is as bad as it could be” but the subway is still too dicey, he said.
In Frankfurt, real estate assistant Anna Pawliczek is driving to work for the first time in her career. “I definitely have always preferred to chill out in the train, instead of being stuck at traffic lights,” she said. But days after Germany ended its lockdown, her company is asking returning employees to avoid public transportation at all costs.
Gasoline demand is rebounding, suggesting that the car -- at least for now -- is making a comeback. As lockdowns ease and parts of the world reopen for business, driving has emerged as the socially distant transportation mode of choice and is offering some near-term relief to an oil market fresh off its worst crash in history and reeling from an unprecedented collapse in energy demand.
“People are using more their cars because they are afraid to use public transportation,” Patrick Pouyanne, the chief executive of French oil giant Total SA , said.
It’s too soon to say whether this change is permanent. In some parts of Asia that reopened earlier than the rest of the world, people are venturing back onto trains. And it’s unclear whether global gasoline demand will ever fully recover.
But on the streets of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, morning traffic is now higher than 2019 averages while subway use is well below normal, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF. Volume on Beijing’s metro system is 53% below pre-virus levels. Subway usage in Shanghai and Guangzhou is down 29% and 39%, respectively.
“At least at the beginning of our way back to normality, we expect a decrease in the use of public transportation,” said Josu Jon Imaz, the head of Spanish oil company Repsol  SA.
Rush Hour Returns
It’s a phenomenon that may begin to reverse the dramatic reductions in air pollution the world’s busiest cities have seen in recent months as travel and industrial operations ground to a halt.
In Berlin, among the first European cities to relax its lockdown, public transit use remains down 61% while the number of people driving has recovered to 28% below normal normal, according to data from Apple Inc ., which tracks request for directions on its popular Maps app.
Apple Maps data for 27 world cities shows that driving directions are recovering more quickly than directions for mass transit. In Madrid, driving is 68% below normal levels, up from about 80% in April, while use of public transport remains down 87%, largely the same level as last month.
The same is occuring in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, where driving directions on the app have recovered to 40% of normal levels, up from 60% in April, while directions for mass transit remain flat from April at 80% below normal levels.
In the U.S., gasoline consumption is clawing back from record lows, rising by 400,000 barrels a day during the week ended May 1. Cities in Florida, one of the first American states to re-open, has seen fuel sales rebound to 30% below normal levels, from 50% weeks ago, according to the Florida Petroleum Marketers Association.
“I think maybe we will get a third of gasoline demand back relatively easy,” said Patrick DeHaan, an analyst at GasBuddy. The rest will come back much more slowly, he said, perhaps taking a year or more. Some demand may never return.
Summer Plans
Gasoline’s recovery may extend into summer amid changes in the way people vacation. In the U.S., demand for long-haul recreational vehicles has picked up as people opt for roadtrips over air travel. Jon Gray, chief executive officer of RVshare, said bookings in some areas have more than doubled compared with last year. “We saw an almost overnight doubling of bookings” as lockdowns showed signs of ending, he said.
Fuel distributor Pilot Flying J Inc. also has noted the trend. “People are thinking about their travel plans for this summer and many are considering road trips due to people feeling more comfortable driving,” said Chief Experience Officer Whitney Haslam Johnson.
A similar pattern played out in China during the five-day Labor Day holiday in May. Over the first four days of the holiday, car trips in Beijing jumped 15%, while trips by plane and train in and out of the city fell 76% and 86%, respectively, according to government data.
Climate Caveat
What’s good for the oil market, though, usually isn’t good for the climate.
Amid the post-lockdown revival of the car, electric vehicles are likely to be left on the sidelines as a struggling economy and cheap gasoline stifles demand for cleaner-burning autos. Even under the most optimistic scenario, worldwide sales growth this year will barely exceed 2019, according to BloombergNEF. Depending on how the pandemic plays out, the outlook is even bleaker.
Widespread lockdowns that have shuttered factories and kept people at home stands to reduce global carbon emissions by 8% this year, the biggest reduction ever, according to the International Energy Agency. But even that won’t be enough to reverse warming temperatures, which have been rising steadily by an average of almost 2.5 parts per million a year since 2010.
Still, a look at cities that were early to re-open suggests that the spike in driving will be short-lived.
In Seoul, software developer Kim Jingi drove to work for a month and half after restrictions eased, in an effort to self-isolate. But for the last two weeks, Kim has returned to the subway.
“I thought it was safe enough,” Kim said. Also, “it was hard to find a parking spot.”"

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is in talks with semiconductor companies about building chip factories in the United States, representatives from two chipmakers said on Sunday.
 Intel Corp   is in discussions with the United States Department of Defense over improving domestic sources for microelectronics and related technology, Intel spokesman William Moss said in an emailed statement.
""Intel is well positioned to work with the U.S. government to operate a U.S.-owned commercial foundry and supply a broad range of secure microelectronics"", the statement added.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330), on the other hand, has been in talks with the U.S. Department of Commerce about building a U.S. factory but said it has not made a final decision yet. 
""We are actively evaluating all the suitable locations, including in the U.S., but there is no concrete plan yet"", TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao said in a statement.
Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan wrote a letter to the Department of Defense in late March in which he expressed the company s willingness to build a foundry - a term used in the industry to reference a chip factory - in partnership with the Pentagon.
""This is more important than ever, given the uncertainty created by the current geopolitical environment"", Swan wrote in the letter dated March 30 and seen by Reuters on Sunday. 
It comes amid increasing diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China during the coronavirus outbreak, with both sides trading barbs over who is to blame for the spread of the disease after already being involved in trade tensions for almost two years.
""We currently think it is in the best interest of the United States and of Intel to explore how Intel could operate a commercial U.S. foundry to supply a broad range of microelectronics,"" the letter from the Intel CEO added.
The Trump administration s discussions with chipmakers were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, with the report adding that TSMC also has been talking with Apple Inc , one of its largest customers, about building a chip factory in the United States. 
TSMC declined to comment on the talks with the iPhone maker.
The Journal had also reported that U.S. officials are looking at helping South Korea s Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930), which has a chip factory in Austin, Texas, to expand its contract-manufacturing operations in the United States. A Samsung spokeswoman in Seoul declined to comment on Monday. 

The U.S. Commerce Department and Apple did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday."

The numbers suggest an early domestic rebound for smartphone makers such as Apple Inc  and Huawei Technolgies [HWT.UL] and a potential return to normalcy in China for the broader consumer hardware market in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak.
Phone makers shipped 40.8 million handsets in April, up from 34.8 million in April 2019, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a state-backed think tank.
For the first time in years, the organisation did not reveal the percentage of Android devices shipped, a key metric that gave insight into how many smartphones Apple sold in China each month.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  Corp (T:6758) expects operating profit to drop at least 30% this financial year to its lowest in four years as the company anticipates a hit to demand for its TVs, cameras and smartphone image sensors from the coronavirus outbreak.
Sony  has halted production at some plants and experienced supply-chain disruptions as governments around the world imposed lengthy restrictions on movement and business activity to contain the virus. 
Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said the consumer electronics business such as TVs ""has been hardest hit right now, but the impact will expand to other businesses as well."" 
The electronics and entertainment company reported a 57% fall in operating profit for the January-March quarter to 35.45 billion yen ($331 million), missing a 73.77 billion yen average of analyst estimates polled by Refinitiv.
The company did not provide precise forecasts for the current year which started in April, but Totoki said current calculations showed that profit was likely to drop ""at least about 30%"" from 845.46 billion yen in the previous year.
The forecast profit of less than 600 billion yen would be the lowest since the year that ended in March 2017, when earthquakes knocked out factories in southern Japan that produce image sensors.
Totoki said profitability at Sony s image sensors business, a key growth driver, could deteriorate as the coronavirus outbreak could cause a shift away from high-end smartphones with multiple-lens cameras that often use the group s advanced image sensors.
Sony controls 51.5% of the world s $15 billion image sensor market, according to data provider  Gartner  , supplying most global smartphone makers including Apple Inc  and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
The impact from the outbreak already reduced group operating profit by 68.2 billion yen for the year ended this March, Sony said.
One bright spot for Sony was its gaming business, which reported a narrower-than-expected profit decline for the year that ended in March. The business had a positive impact of 2.8 billion yen from the coronavirus outbreak, as consumers locked down at home looked for entertainment and downloaded more gaming software.
Sony is scheduled to launch its PlayStation 5 (PS5) during the year-end holiday shopping season, seven years after its previous generation games console. 

Sony reiterated the year-end timing for the PS5 launch, denying media speculation that the coronavirus would impact production and cause a major delay. The company has nevertheless been forced to announce delays to major games titles such as The Last Of Us Part II."

MAENNEDORF, Switzerland (Reuters) - Love led a young Swiss doctor to emigrate to South Africa, his wife s home country. Years later, love for his disabled child brought him back to Switzerland.
The know-how Stefan Metzker gained on his journey - first as a Cape Town intensive care specialist, then supplying African doctors with Chinese-made surgical scrubs and now as a Swiss hospital CEO - prepared him to help when COVID-19 struck.
Answering a call from Zurich officials desperate for face masks, surgical gowns and gloves, Metzker leveraged a Chinese business contact he had forged decades ago to secure 23 million items of medical gear.
Since April, passenger-turned-cargo jets belonging to Lufthansa unit Swiss Air Lines have made 15 non-stop flights from Shanghai to Zurich.
The 16th and final flight, with the last of what amounted to 230 tons of equipment, is due later this month.
""I wouldn t have recommended it if I hadn t known the people in China for years through my activities in South Africa,"" Metzker, 59, told Reuters.
""Based on trust, and the long relationship I had, it was possible to pay up front. That allowed us to secure large volumes at reasonable prices, at a time when raw materials were extremely scarce.""
Business leaders like Apple  s Tim Cook, Twitter s Jack Dorsey and Salesforce  s Marc Benioff have used connections or pledged personal wealth to secure medical supplies or finance coronavirus relief.
The air bridge Metzker helped organise underscores how people far from the limelight have also tapped their experience to make a difference.
SWITZERLAND TO SOUTH AFRICA
After apartheid s collapse, Metzker and his wife, Christine, left Switzerland in 1995 for Cape Town s Tygerberg Hospital, for a job treating intensive care patients.
There, he watched aghast as surgeons clad only in traditional cotton scrubs became soaked with blood of patients, many of whom had AIDS.
Since South African hospitals could not afford expensive protective clothing, Metzker said he enlisted university partners in the early 2000s to develop affordable, re-usable medical textiles.
""We developed a fabric to protect us against blood and body fluids,"" Metzker said. ""Through this business, I made relationships with international suppliers.""
In 2009, however, Metzker s family returned to Switzerland so his son, who has a severe neurological disease, could safely attend school in his electric wheelchair. Metzker took a job as CEO of Spital Maennedorf, a 150-bed, 950-employee hospital on Lake Zurich.
As COVID-19 rolled over Switzerland in February and March, officials in Zurich feared a three-month protective equipment supply in the nation s emergency stockpile would not last.
With nations everywhere clamoring for equipment, Zurich s government pharmacy put out an all-points bulletin, asking for help from anybody who could get their hands on masks, gloves and scrubs.
Metzker remembered his Chinese contacts and stepped forward.
""I thought to myself, ""Oh, man! It can t be that a country like Switzerland is heading toward a disaster without the protective material we need,"" he said.
There were challenges. 
A sudden change in Chinese regulations stalled one early April shipment at Shanghai customs before the Swiss consulate in China intervened to finally get the plane aloft, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said.
Zurich officials acknowledged Metzker s role in the deliveries but did not comment on details including their cost. Metzker said the regional government reacted swiftly, paying in advance after he reassured them the Chinese supplies would come through.
RISING PRICES
Zurich opted to have gear shipped directly from Shanghai, not via another country, for fear other governments might seize it. Germany accused the United States of ""modern piracy"" in early April in a case of masks diverted from an airport in Bangkok.
There was another reason for haste: Prices were rising as demand skyrocketed. A surgical gown he bought for less than $2 now costs about $8, Metzker said.
Metzker s hospital doubled the number of ICU beds with ventilators to 12, though they were never completely filled.
Still, he said, it was ""mind-blowing"" just how much protective equipment was needed, with doctors and nurses discarding layer after layer every shift.
With Zurich-area hospitals  shelves now stocked and COVID-19 infections waning, Metzker believes they are prepared should the virus flare up again, which some fear as Switzerland joins other countries in gradually relaxing restrictions.

""We probably could even afford the luxury of shipping by sea or by train in the future,"" Metzker said. ""We re ready for a second wave, if there is one."""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet  Inc-owned Google s planned $2.1 billion buy of fitness trackers company Fitbit  may harm consumers and hinder innovation, European consumer group BEUC said on Wednesday, calling it a game-changer deal in the health and digital markets.
Google announced the deal in November last year, a move which would allow it to take on Apple  and Samsung (KS:005930) in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches. Huawei [HWT.UL] and Xiaomi  also compete in the market.
Critics however said the deal would give the U.S. tech giant access to a trove of health data gathered from Fitbit s fitness trackers and other devices used to monitor users  daily steps, calories burned and distance travelled.
BEUC, which counts 45 national consumer organisations from 32 European countries as its members, said the Google bid marks yet another strategic deal in digital markets by a handful of tech giants amassing unprecedented market power.
""If Google acquires consumers  data generated by the use of Fitbit wearables, including now COVID-19 related data, it would be able to use that data for its own benefit and could undermine the ability of other companies to bring new products to consumers,"" BEUC said in a report.
""This could harm innovation and consumer choice in several markets such as online advertising, search, health and wearables. The proposed merger therefore has the potential to touch not only digital markets but also a vital part of all European citizens  lives, their health and well-being.""
Google, who has been fined more than 8 billion euros by EU antitrust regulators for abusing its market power in online searches and its Android smartphone operating system, said it would be transparent about the data it collects from wearables and why.
""We will never sell personal information to anyone. Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads. And we will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move, or delete their data,"" the company said, reiterating comments from a November blog when it announced the deal.
It is now briefing EU antitrust regulators about the deal prior to making a formal request for approval.

The European Data Protection Board in February warned the deal could pose privacy risks. Privacy advocates and some U.S. lawmakers have called on the U.S. Department of Justice to block the deal. "

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission urged EU governments on Wednesday to use COVID-19 contact tracing apps on a voluntary basis as part of efforts to lift border restrictions and revive the European Union s tourism and travel industries.
Countries are rushing to develop mobile tracing apps, hoping that the smartphone technology could help bring about a reopening of borders - crucial to trade - without unleashing a second wave of the pandemic. 
That in turn has kindled concerns about privacy breaches and government surveillance long after the virus crisis has eased. The apps use Bluetooth short-range wireless to identify those who have come into contact with people infected with the virus.
The Commission, which is the executive of the 27-nation EU, sought to allay such fears.
""Tracing apps must be voluntary, transparent, temporary, cybersecure, using pseudonymised data, should rely on Bluetooth technology and be interoperable across borders as well as across operating systems,"" it said in a statement.
The Commission also set out guidelines to help developers design apps that can work with each other and throughout the EU.
These include minimum requirements for apps to communicate with each other to allow users to receive an alert wherever they are in the EU, and in instances where they have been in contact with people infected with the virus. 
The apps should make it possible for health authorities to inform people about their positive COVID-19 test results, calculate users  exposure risk score, and send out alerts on possible follow-up action.
Worries about apps not being able to work across EU borders surfaced after a spat between France and Apple . France accused the company of undermining its virus-fighting effort by refusing to help make its iPhones more compatible with a planned ""StopCovid"" contact-tracing app.

Apple and Alphabet  Inc s Google, whose operating systems power 99% of the world s smartphones, are working together to create an app to slow the virus spread by allowing users to opt into logging other phones they have been near."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - As the spread of the new coronavirus in Canada slows, the western province of Alberta has rolled out a digital-tracing tool to monitor outbreaks as quarantine restrictions ease. The hard part is convincing people to use it.
On May 1, Alberta launched Canada s first smartphone app to trace and call people who have come into contact with an individual infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, so that they can isolate themselves and prevent further spread.
But so far, only about 165,000 Albertans, or less than 4% of the population, have downloaded it. By contrast, the Singapore app -- the model for Alberta -- has 1.4 million users, or almost 25% of the population on the Southeast Asian island. 
""We all know we need to increase the uptake,"" said Jia Hu, the medical officer for Alberta Health Services who is leading the rollout of the app. ""People are scared of the government having their data. That s why we made it as lean as possible.""
Alberta s voluntary app, called ABTraceTogether, has not been running properly on iPhones. Though Hu said a fix is being worked on, it may not come until Apple  and Google  provide new technology later this month.
But the real challenge has been the fear that ""Big Brother (is) watching over you with the app"", Hu said. 
Brenda McPhail at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association is concerned whether ""a system of data surveillance"" is necessary or useful. 
""There s a great deal of hype and a lot of push for the idea,"" McPhail said of tracing apps. ""We are rapidly considering a wide range of measures that are rights infringing during this pandemic.""
The Alberta app collects phone numbers and total time spent with people who have come within two meters of each other for a total of 15 minutes in a 24-hour period, but it gathers no location data. 
Alberta is running an ad campaign urging people to download the software. 
""It s not that if we have 10% (uptake) it s useless, and with 80% it s useful. It s just the more we have the better,"" Hu told Reuters. 
Alberta is gradually restarting its economy, including opening up golf courses and some services. Hu, who previously helped run Alberta Health Services  traditional tracing activities, has no doubts about the app.

""This app is literally going to save lives,"" he said, adding there was ""a direct connection between downloading the app and going back to restaurants and seeing your friends and family and traveling again""."

LONDON/FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU officials are seeking to finalise a plan for public stakes to be taken in key European companies to shield them from the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The European Union is looking to take decisive, unified action to support corporates after plans to help struggling southern states became mired in dispute and led to some politicians questioning the future of the European project.
On May 5, after weeks of negotiations, France called for ""an equity fund, either to recapitalise or to acquire shares in strategic companies that need capital, especially for those operating in European strategic value chains"", according to a proposal submitted to the EU commission and seen by Reuters.
One favoured option is the creation of a central ""solvency support"" scheme, funded by member states, to direct investments into companies deemed systemically important, according to the three sources familiar with the discussions.
Another could see European companies issue convertible bonds to the European Investment Bank, the EU s lending arm, that could later turn into an equity stake, said two of the sources.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment.
While all member states have largely embraced the idea of such investment, its governance has proved a stumbling block along traditional fault lines, said the sources who declined to be named as the negotiations are confidential.
Italy and France want the new scheme to prioritise support for companies in countries worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic and economic slump, and with fewer financial resources at their disposal, according to the sources.
But German officials have asked for more visibility on the benefits that Europe s largest economy will get from ploughing a large chunk of the cash into the scheme, they said.
Much of the detail surrounding any scheme to protect companies - and not just states - is yet to be finalised. A broad announcement on it is expected in the coming days as part of a trillion-euro plan for a recovery fund, the sources said.
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS
The plan to take stakes in companies is inspired by previous proposals backed by France and Italy to strengthen Europe s ""strategic"" industries. 
Last August, EU officials examined the creation of an EU sovereign wealth fund to invest in European champions in sectors where Europe lags behind global rivals such as technology, according to an internal document seen by Reuters that mentioned stepping up competition with U.S. giants such as Apple  and Google  as well as China s  Alibaba  .
This plan stalled in the autumn, and the wealth fund never materialised. But the broad idea of the bloc investing in major companies was revived by Italian and French officials after the coronavirus hit Europe as a way to overcome the stalemate on debt mutualisation, the sources said.
It was also championed by internal market commissioner Thierry Breton as a way to protect systemically important businesses in Europe and deter any unwanted takeover or stake-building from outside actors.
Concerns over the vulnerability of some European companies grew in April when it emerged that Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund had amassed stakes in four European oil majors, including France s Total and Italy s  ENI  . 
Another method of investing in companies being examined by EU officials is by making greater use of an agency that takes small stakes in companies, the European Fund for Strategic Investment, to bolster businesses struck by the pandemic, one source said.
Since it was set up in 2015, the fund has made roughly 1.9 billion euros of small investments in companies specialising in life science, renewable energy and digitalisation.
The 27-member bloc is also looking at using its central budget to give guarantees to the European Investment Bank that would, in turn, hand out loans to companies struggling in the slump, another source said.
That would lower the risk for other private investors or a national development bank, which could then grant further credit or take a stake in the company. Such aid would be directed at countries worst hit by the crisis, the person added. 
EUROPEAN UNITY?
While the idea of public stakes in companies has won broad backing, some experts remain set against it.
""I do not favour the recovery fund taking stakes in companies. I do not favour this French model of sponsoring industry,"" said Lars Feld, chairman of the German government s council of economic experts that advises the chancellery, finance ministry and economy ministry on policy.
The nature of the scheme - whether permanent or temporary - is also a key point of contention, the sources said.
Germany wants certainty that any temporary measure would grant an immediate payback when assets are sold, one source said, depending on how much each member state has contributed to the scheme.
France and Italy hope that the scheme can be beefed up over time to build European champions and protect key industries, said one source.
Despite the divisions, negotiations are progressing amid pressures from German, Italian and French industry lobby groups which recently called for a unified European effort to support businesses in trouble.

""No European company should fail because of lack of support,"" they said in a joint statement."

AMS supplies sensors for Apple face recognition technology on iPhones and is in the process of buying Osram (DE:OSRn), the leading manufacturer of car headlamps, for up to $5 billion as it seeks a new sales outlet in the auto industry.
Its shares have lost nearly half their value this year as investors worry about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the company s level of debt.
After an earlier 11% fall, the Zurich-listed shares were down 9.9% at 12.80 Swiss francs at 1415 GMT and were the biggest decliner in the sector (SX8P).
To refund a 4.4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) bridge loan, provided by UBS , HSBC  and Bank of America Merrill Lynch  for the Osram deal, ASM had already issued 190 million new shares for 1.75 billion Swiss francs (1.7 billion euros).
Now it is seeking shareholder approval to issue convertible notes, profit participation bonds or profit participation rights that could translate into 27.4 million new shares, the invitation to its June 3 shareholders meeting said.
That would deliver only 390 million francs according to Tuesday s closing price, but further dilute the shares. 
A spokesman for the Austrian company said the capital raise was not directly linked to the Osram takeover and the company had carried out comparable action before.

India was set to roll out a version of its coronavirus contact-tracing application Aarogya Setu for JioPhones within days, as it looks to increase the reach of the system, Reuters reported last week.
India, which imposed the world s biggest shutdown in late March to battle the spread of the coronavirus, last month launched the Aarogya Setu (Health Bridge) app -- a Bluetooth and GPS-based application which alerts users who may have come in contact with people who later test positive for COVID-19.

The app, which was now been downloaded by 100 million Indians, was initially available only on Google  s Android and on Apple  devices."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is aggressively pushing a state-backed contact tracing app to fight the spread of COVID-19, raising fears that the world s second-most populous nation is on its way to Chinese-style methods of high tech social control.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has touted its app, Aarogya Setu, or ""Health Bridge,"" as a key tool in fighting the deadly coronavirus. With more than 70,000 people already infected, the number of cases in India is expected to exceed China, the origin of the outbreak, within a week. 
Like many apps being rolled out around the world, Aarogya Setu uses Bluetooth signals on smartphones to record when people come in close contact with one another, so that contacts can be quickly alerted when a person tests positive for COVID-19.
But the Indian app also uses GPS location data to augment the information gathered via Bluetooth and build a centralized database of the spread of the infection--an approach avoided by most countries for privacy reasons.
And it mimics China s health QR code system with a feature that rates a person s likely health status with green, orange or red colours, signifying whether the individual is safe, at high risk or a carrier of the virus.
On top of that, the federal government earlier this month made use of the app mandatory for all public and private sector employees returning to work as the world s biggest lockdown eases--drawing sharp criticism from digital rights  advocates.
It made India the world s only democratic country to make the use of a contact tracing app mandatory for its citizens, according to Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC). 
""The government is virtually forcing you and taking your data without consent,"" said B.N. Srikrishna, a former Supreme Court judge, who led an effort to draft India s first data-privacy law.
""Once your fundamental rights are being breached left and right, without anybody to question you, and if the courts are not going to help you, you re even worse than China.""
But the Modi government, which has drawn international criticism for its treatment of the country s large Muslim minority, is not backing down though.
The railway ministry, which is currently running special trains to take migrant workers and others to their home towns, has ordered all passengers to download Aarogya Setu ""before commencing their journey"".
A paramilitary force guarding India s airports and the metro train stations in capital New Delhi has proposed a similar plan for all passengers, according to Indian media reports.
A spokesman for the paramilitary CISF said it had made no such recommendations to the government, while the Delhi Metro said it was yet to finalise its plan to resume services.
And in Noida, a hub for smartphone manufacturing on the outskirts of New Delhi, police are using the country s criminal code to ensure everyone on the road has downloaded the app.
PRIVACY, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS
The National Informatics Centre (NIC ), the government agency which developed Aarogya Setu, is free to share personal data from the app with government departments and public health institutions, according to a circular issued by India s technology ministry on May 11.
The system could be used to create permanent government databases containing sensitive personal information about Indian citizens, said New Delhi-based digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF). The IFF also raised a red flag about the NIC s ability to share anonymised data with Indian universities and research institutions.
""This demonstrates the incentives for why the government of India has taken a centralised approach,"" the IFF said. ""It is less about taking the least intrusive measure towards responding to the public health crisis, but more towards maximising the utility of data.""
India s technology ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Critics, including a French hacker, have called on the government to make the app s source code public, so that independent researchers can fully understand the technology.
The government intends to do that, two senior officials from India s technology ministry told Reuters, but declined to give a timeline.
The technology ministry has previously said that the Aarogya Setu app can help authorities identify virus hot spots and better target health efforts, and that information would be used ""only for administering necessary medical interventions"".
An official at the government think-tank, NITI Aayog, said last month that the app was a ""temporary solution to a temporary problem"", adding that the country may have stumbled across ""the initial building block for a India health stack"".
AADHAR 2.0
Critics say the government s approach to the app is reminiscent of the Modi administration s effort to make Aadhar, a biometric ID system, mandatory for everything from opening a new bank account to getting a mobile phone connection.
That push, which also lead to fears of a surveillance state, was reined in by India s top court in 2018.
There are also questions of whether the core Bluetooth contact-tracing functions will work effectively without new technology from Apple  and Google , which many countries are now adopting. The tech giants will not permit apps such as Aarogya Setu, that use GPS and are made mandatory, to use their tools.
So far nearly 100 million Indian smartphone users have downloaded the app since its launch in early April. The government on Thursday released a version of the app for roughly 5 million users of the cheap internet-enabled JioPhone. The rollout will soon cover the remaining roughly 95 million JioPhone users.
But another 300 million Indians use basic feature phones and do not have access to the Aarogya Setu app. 
For them, India has launched a toll-free number that connects their devices to the Aarogya Setu platform, allowing them to self-assess for COVID-19 via an interactive voice response system.
But the mandatory use of the app could marginalise these people if the rules mean they can t get on a train to go to work.
""It s not just a privacy issue but a human rights issue where you are going to exclude a whole section of the society from accessing transport, from accessing their workplace,"" Prasanth Sugathan of SFLC India said.

""It s definitely going to be a big problem for them."""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower for a third straight day after data showing initial jobless claims fell more slowly than expected than last week, further stoking fears that the economy will struggle to rebound even as the country moves out of lockdown.
By 10:10 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 378 points or 1.6% at 22,870 points, its lowest in over a month. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.4%. 
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial jobless claims fell to 2.98 million last week - the first week since March that they ve been below 3 million but still considerably above expectations of 2.50 million.  The numbers took the total number of initial claims since the pandemic erupted to over 36 million, or one quarter of the workforce.
Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the numbers showed a disappointingly slow decline in the rate of new claims, and said the number is now unlikely to drop below 1 million before the end of June. 
""That said, the proportion of the previous week’s initial claims then appearing in the continuing claims numbers a week later has fallen for seven straight weeks, so hiring is not completely dead,"" Pantheon s Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients.
The market was also rocked early Thursday by more aggressive rhetoric toward China from President Donald Trump, reviving fears of the trade war that rocked markets last year. Trump told Fox Business News that: ""We could cut off the whole relationship"" with China, something he said would ""save"" the U.S. $500 billion a year. Fox also reported that the administration is looking for ways to punish or seek financial compensation from China for what it sees as withholding information about the coronavirus. 
Already this week, Trump has directed a federal pension program to divest its holdings of Chinese equities and signed an executive order extending a ban on U.S. companies doing business with telecoms company Huawei until the end of May 2021. 
That helped push names such as Apple , which manufactures its smartphones in China, down 1.7%, while Tesla  stock, which relies in large measure on the Chinese market for its growth outlook, fell 2.5%. 
Delta Air Lines  stock fell 8.9% after a Reuters report detailing the likely extent of overstaffing at the end of the third quarter. The company is currently not allowed to lay off staff as part of the conditions for its bailout from the federal government. United Airlines stock fell over 10% after a class action was filed by employees to stop it forcing them to take off 20 days as unpaid leave, something they said violated the bailout conditions.
Elsewhere, Grubhub   stock fell 8.3% and Uber  stock fell 3.6% as enthusiasm for their mooted combination cooled. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to impose new taxes on American companies that produce goods outside the United States, another move his administration could make to push supply chains away from China and raise new trade barriers.
Trump said in a Fox Business Network interview that taxation was an ""incentive"" for companies to return manufacturing to the United States. He did not specify whether these would be new across-the-board tariffs or another form of taxes, which would require an act of Congress. 
""You know, if we wanted to put up our own border, like other countries do to us, Apple  would build 100 percent of their product in the United States. That’s the way it would work,"" Trump said.
U.S. officials say that Trump s administration is ""turbocharging"" efforts to push companies to move production of away from China, partly as a way to punish Beijing for its early handling of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Asked whether Trump would consider giving companies tax breaks to return manufacturing operations to the United States, he said he may tax them if they don t and suggested they had a duty to re-shore operations. 
""One incentive, frankly, is to charge tax for them when they make product outside. We don’t have to do much for them. They have to do for us,"" Trump said.
The former real estate developer spent much of his first three years in office waging a trade war against China over its trade practices, technology transfer and industrial policies, imposing punitive tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese imports.
By January, before the coronavirus spread globally, Trump s new tariffs had cost American companies $46 billion, according to Commerce Department data.
Many business groups and economists are calling for Trump to cut tariffs, at least temporarily, to ease cost pressures on U.S. companies facing severe drops in revenues.
The International Monetary Fund has warned that raising new trade barriers will prolong the worst recession since the 1930s Great Depression.
On Thursday, Trump, who is seeking re-election in November and needs to win key manufacturing battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, called global supply chains ""stupid"" and said the coronavirus has exposed their weaknesses as critical products are cut off. 

""I said we shouldn’t have supply chains. We should have them all in the United States. We have the companies to do it. And if we don’t, we can do that,"" he said."

Contact-tracing, a disease control tactic that traditionally relies on patients  memories of their movements, identifies people they might have infected so they too can be isolated.
    
FIRST GENERATION APPS THAT USE BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY
Bluetooth is a short-range radio technology used for things like connecting wireless headphones to a smartphone. It detects when another Bluetooth signal is near and can estimate the distance between devices -- making it a good tool for contact-tracing.
Singapore s TraceTogether, launched in March, was the first Bluetooth-based contact-tracing app. When a person tests positive for COVID-19, health authorities can look at the person s Bluetooth history and, in Singapore s case, call all the people on that list and order them to quarantine.
Countries that have launched similar Bluetooth apps include Australia, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.
But these apps face obstacles. Most of the population has to use them if they are to be effective. On Apple  s iPhone, the app has to be open at all times for it to work, which is a drain on the battery. Apps may fail to record some encounters between iPhones and devices running Google’s Android operating system, or between pairs of older Android devices.
    
APPS THAT WILL USE THE APPLE-GOOGLE BLUETOOTH APPROACH
The two tech giants said last month they would build special software to make Bluetooth apps work better. At first, this will be a tool that developers can integrate in their apps. That is due out in coming days.
Later this year, Apple and Google  will include the tool in software updates, meaning users can log contacts without having to download an app.
The two companies set strict privacy rules. Apps cannot collect any personal data, including where contacts happened. Contact data is stored only on the phone, and when a user is confirmed as infected an anonymous notification about possible exposure will go directly to other phones. 
In France, Norway, Britain and the United States, governments complained this is too limiting, as they won t be able to see where disease clusters are. But given the challenge of making apps work smoothly without the Apple-Google tools, the Norway, U.K. and some governments in the U.S. told Reuters they are now considering giving up on collecting location data.
Many European countries including Germany and Italy have agreed to go with, or shown interest, in the Google-Apple approach, with a Swiss-led consortium, DP-3T, leading the way. 
    
APPS THAT USE PHONE LOCATION DATA
The GPS satellite system, as well as cellphone towers, make it possible for governments and network operators to track smartphones and many other types of mobile phones. Using a database, health authorities can then see when and where a person who tested positive crossed paths with other people.
The data isn t perfect: GPS can be inexact in a crowded high-rise, for example, and cell-tower data varies in precision. Systematic use of such data to track people is invasive and thus anathema to many people and governments.
Still, Ghana, Iceland, India, Israel, Norway and the several U.S. states have rolled out apps that use location data. 
    
APPS THAT GO BEYOND CONTACT TRACING
Some countries, notably China, have developed apps that collect personal health data, travel and other information useful for disease control and identifying individuals at risk. Chinese citizens must carry a ""health code"" app that rates their risk level to enter shops or ride on trains, for example. 
India s app has similar functions, and Colombia told Reuters it hopes to launch an app with a ""digital passport"" feature.
Private companies around the world may also require such apps for people to return to work. 
    
OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE CONTACT-TRACING APPS
It remains unknown whether Bluetooth-based contact-tracing apps will be effective. The early apps still only have limited adoption and are hampered by their lack of the Apple-Google technology. A major concern is that apps will log an overwhelming number of erroneous contacts. Privacy worries could limit uptake of the apps and make them ineffective.
OTHER METHODS OF HIGH TECH CONTACT-TRACING
Many law enforcement and spy agencies can track people without consent via phones, surveillance cameras and other methods. Such techniques have been used in China for COVID-19 tracking. Israel uses such systems also for that purpose, though not without controversy.

Commercial ""spyware"" companies have also tried to sell their systems for COVID-19 tracking. "

TSMC, a major supplier to Apple Inc , announced on Friday it will build a $12 billion chip factory in Arizona, in what the company called a ""strong partnership"" with the U.S. government. Pompeo said the investment will strengthen U.S.-Taiwan ties.

""TSMC s announcement comes at a critical juncture, when China is competing to dominate cutting-edge technology and control critical industries. The TSMC facility in Arizona will increase U.S. economic independence"", Pompeo said on Friday."

(Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), the biggest contract chipmaker, said it plans to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in an apparent win for the Trump administration s efforts to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China.
The plan, which will create over 1,600 jobs, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump steps up criticism of Chinese trade practices and Beijing s handling of the novel coronavirus ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
Trump has long pledged to bring manufacturing back from overseas and now a steep economic slump brought on by the coronavirus is driving a government-wide push to end U.S. production and supply chain dependency on China.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross touted the deal as ""another indication that President Trump’s policy agenda has led to a renaissance in American manufacturing.""
TSMC is a major supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc  and  Qualcomm Inc  , as well as Chinese firms like Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], which Washington has put on a trade blacklist.
""This project is of critical, strategic importance to a vibrant and competitive U.S. semiconductor ecosystem that enables leading U.S. companies to fabricate their cutting-edge semiconductor products within the United States,"" TSMC said. 
While huge in terms of foreign investment in the United States, the plan is small by TSMC s standards. For 2020, TSMC s capex plan is $15-$16 billion. 
The Taiwanese chipmaker said the plan was to build the plant over nine years.
""The budget... suggests the eventual scale won t be big,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note, adding revenue contribution from the plant will stay at around 3%-4%.
""The scale and technology is similar to what TSMC did in China, suggesting a balance between the US & China.""
A U.S. Commerce Department official said TSMC s decision to locate the plant in the United States generated ""good will"" at the department, the drafter of a law that would, if implemented, severely restrict TSMC chip sales to Huawei. 
 Credit Suisse   analysts said proposed restrictions could threaten TSMC’s 14% of sales from Huawei, escalate U.S.-China tensions and delay the rollout of the next-generation 5G mobile network.
""While it is hard to be certain, we believe that TSMC announcing a U.S. Fab could remove the threat of further Huawei restrictions in the very near-term at least,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note.
Shares of TSMC, the world s most valuable semiconductor company with a market capitalisation of about $255 billion, exceeding  Intel Corp  s , closed up 1.7% on Friday, outperforming a 0.3% gain in the main Taiwan stock market (TWII).
ADVANCED CHIPS
The plant, the biggest foreign investment by TSMC, will produce the most sophisticated 5 nanometer chips, which can be used in high-end defense and communications devices. 
TSMC manufactures the bulk of its chips in Taiwan and has older chip facilities in China and Washington state.
Its chips power Apple s iPhones and the iPhone maker works closely with TSMC to become the first to take advantage of new advances in its chip-making processes.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said chips from the new TSMC plant will power everything from artificial intelligence to 5G base stations to F-35 fighter jets.
Semiconductors play a key role in both consumer electronics and defense equipment. The vast majority of the most advanced chips are made in Asia, which has caused concern among U.S. officials as a strategic rivalry with China deepens over the origins of the deadly coronavirus.
While Intel has major manufacturing operations in the United States, it supplies only its own chips rather than making them for outside customers.
The Trump administration has been in talks with both Intel and TSMC to build a plant in the United States, and Intel said last week it was in discussions with the Department of Defense about improving domestic sources for microelectronics and related technology.
The TSMC announcement is not expected to derail the Pentagon’s efforts to bolster the supply chain for microprocessors, despite the Commerce Department s working on the TSMC deal independently, a person familiar with the matter said.
Apple and Intel declined to comment.
TSMC said that construction of the Arizona facility would begin in 2021 with production targeted to begin in 2024, and that it would be able to process up to 20,000 silicon wafers per month. Each wafer can contain thousands of individual chips. The investment will be made from 2021 to 2029.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the latest details of TSMC s plans."

Apple Inc .’s most important manufacturing partner recorded a 89% decline in net income to NT$2.1 billion ($70 million) in the first three months of 2020. Revenue slid almost 12% to NT$929.7 billion, according to Bloomberg News’ calculations based on previously reported monthly sales numbers.
Known as Foxconn, the Taiwanese company gets half its revenue from making iPhones and devices for Apple in China. But global shipments of smartphones fell at their fastest rate on record in the first quarter, hitting the assembler’s sales even though its main production facilities managed to return to full seasonal staffing levels around mid-March.
Production at many of Apple’s Asian partners ground to a halt after efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 kicked in. That resulted in severe shipping delays for devices and led to component supply bottlenecks. Consumers also sheltered at home, hammering retail sales. At one point, Apple shuttered all 42 retail outlets in China, a critical market for the company, followed by store closures in other countries. While shops in China have reopened, most of its international ones have not.
Covid-19 has also delayed product development and launches. Apple’s four upcoming redesigned iPhones with 5G will come out several weeks later than usual -- but still within the fall window -- Bloomberg News has reported. In May, Apple failed to provide a forecast for the first time in more than a decade.
Foxconn has already slashed its 2020 revenue projections in the wake of the pandemic. It told investors in April that it still has time to help Apple launch new iPhones in time for the holidays, but cautioned the schedule could be disrupted if the pandemic persists.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai’s sales pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, U.S.-China trade disputes, smartphone-market weakness and a broader slowdown in tech spending won’t abate quickly and will likely mean a w-shaped sales recovery through 2020, even as its Chinese manufacturing gets back to full seasonal capacity.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn s (TW:2317) first-quarter profit plunged to its lowest in two decades, all but wiped out, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the Taiwanese firm to suspend manufacturing operations in China and knocked demand from customers including Apple Inc (0:AAPL).
But the world s largest contract electronics manufacturer, formally called  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, said the worst of the virus outbreak for the company was over. 
New growth was to be found in the work-from-home lifestyles being adopted around the world even if the outlook for smartphone and other consumer electronics demand remained bleak, it said. 
""Hon Hai will stabilize in the second quarter,"" Foxconn said in a statement, adding that all of its main factories in China have now resumed normal operations. 
Net profit for January-March slumped 90% to T$2.1 billion ($70.3 million) from a year earlier - the lowest level since the first quarter of 2000 and well short of a Refinitiv consensus estimate of T$8.88 billion. Revenue declined 12%.
For the second-quarter, the company expects revenue will show double-digit percentage growth from January-March although it will still likely mark a single-digit decline from the same period a year earlier.
""Telecommuting, online entertainment and new lifestyles have brought us new growth momentum,"" Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told an investor teleconference.
He added that its enterprise and computing units are expected to see a yearly revenue growth of more than 10% and more than 15% respectively in the current quarter.
The exception is its consumer electronics division, much of which is smartphones. The division is forecast to post a 15% yearly decline in sales as the virus is set to have ""an enormous"" impact on demand. In the first quarter, the division accounted for 42% of revenue.
""For consumer electronic products, because everyone is staying at home, naturally it affects consumers  purchasing power and such power might take a very long time to recover,"" he said.
Highlighting that weak demand, first-quarter smartphone shipments in China tumbled 20%, its largest decline ever, data from market researcher IDC showed this month.
Taiwan-based research firm TrendForce said last month it expects global smartphone production to slump a record 16.5% to 287 million phones in the June quarter from a year earlier as the coronavirus muzzles demand.
Liu declined to given an earnings outlook for the second half or the full year, saying the pandemic had made forecasting too uncertain.
Foxconn shares closed 1.4% lower ahead of the results on Friday, versus a 0.3% gain for the broader market (TWII). They have lost 15% for the year to date.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets clawed back early losses on Friday , but still drifted lower amid growing concerns that the pandemic and its political fallout will breathe new life into an economically damaging trade war that had been in suspended animation since January. 
Wall Street rebounded after an initial blow from figures showing the biggest ever monthly drop in retail sales in April, the first full month of lockdowns dictated by public health concerns. April s data for industrial production and manufacturing output were, however, marginally better than expected. 
By 10:20 AM ET (1420 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 4 points, effectively unchanged on the day, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3%. In a conspicuous contrast to recent trading patterns, the Nasdaq Composite was underperforming, losing 0.4% as semiconductor stocks - typically sensitive to the trade issue - fell more sharply than most. That followed a new executive order tightening the current restrictions on sales of high-performance chips by U.S. companies to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, which the administration has repeatedly accused of aiding Chinese spying.
Qualcomm  stock fell 4.2% in early trading, while Micron Technology  stock fell 3.6% and Intel   stock fell 2.4%, after Hu Xijin, editor of the Chinese English-language publication The Global Times, warned of possible retaliation. He also singled out Cisco Systems , Apple and Boeing  as possible targets. Apple   stock fell 2.0% but the other companies  moves were unremarkable. 
Earlier, the Census Bureau reported that retail sales fell 16.4% in  April as the country s malls and stores were shut down by government order to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Core retail sales fell an even sharper 17.2%. Industrial production, meanwhile, fell 11.2% and manufacturing output by 13.7%, as the nation s factories ground to a near-halt.
""As with the retail sales numbers, these data likely mark the floor for industrial output, but the rebound will be much less steep than the collapse, so a huge Q2 drop is a certainty,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson. ""The lost ground will not be quickly recovered.""
The retail sales numbers underlined how much online retailers had gained at the expense of traditional ones, with non-store retail actually rising 8.4% on the month. However, the news failed to move Amazon.com Inc  stock, which fell 0.6%, while Walmart  stock rose 1.0%.  The phenomenon wasn t limited to the U.S., with ADRs in Chinese retailer JD.com  rising sharply after it posted better-than-expected quarterly numbers, also lifting the ADRs of rival  Pinduoduo  .
Elsewhere, crude oil prices extended their recent gains as more investors bought into the narrative of global market rebalancing.  U.S. Crude futures were up 5.1% at $28.96 a barrel, their highest since early April."

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is putting stringent health measures in place at the locations, as it has in other stores that are slowly reopening in the U.S., China, Australia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland and South Korea.
“We’re excited to begin welcoming visitors back to some of our stores in Italy this Tuesday,” Apple said in a statement on Friday. “Our newly reopened stores will have significant safety procedures including temperature checks, social distancing and face coverings to ensure customers and employees continue to stay healthy.” The company will also let a limited number of customers in the stores at a time.

Italy was one of the first regions to be affected by the novel coronavirus and Apple closed its retail doors there relatively early. The company isn’t yet reopening its locations in Lombardy and Piedmont, two of the country’s hardest hit areas.
Beyond stores, Apple has operations and product development centers in Italy and restricted employee travel to the country at the beginning of March.

Investing.com – Wall Street closed above session lows on Friday, led by a rebound in large-cap tech stocks, but couldn t avert its worst weekly slump since March as investors had to contend with weaker economic data and rising U.S-China trade tensions.
The S&P 500 gained 0.43%, but still recorded its worst weekly performance since the week ended March 29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.25%, or 60 points, after falling by as many as 271 points intraday, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.79%.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales fell 16.4% last month, worse than the 12% decline expected. But the prior month s numbers were upwardly revised to -8.3%.The retail sales control group, which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP, fell 15.3%.
The weaker backdrop for consumer spending, however, is expected to get a boost from pent-up demand and the recent stimulus rolled out by Congress.
""The pronounced weakness in April sales sets the stage for a bounce in May spending, which could be significant,"" Jefferies  said in a note. ""There is near-term support from stimulus payments which were largely saved in April, and a good deal of pent-up demand.""
Also helping sentiment, Michigan consumer sentiment for May, was better than feared, rising to a reading of 73.7 from 71.8 a month earlier, topping economists  forecasts of 68.
Wall Street s comeback from session lows coincided with a rebound in the bulk of FAANG stocks, with Netflix  leading the pack, closing 2.8% higher. Apple  was the exception, falling 0.6%.
Energy gave up gains to closer just below the flatline even as oil prices surged on data showing that China, the world s largest oil importer, ramped-up daily crude oil use in April. That added to recent optimism for a recovery oil demand amid government efforts to lift restrictions that had weighed on economic growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street s three major indexes closed higher after swinging between gains and losses on Friday as investors weighed worries about Sino-U.S. trade relations and weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data against growing optimism that easing coronavirus restrictions would boost activity this month. 
Economic data painted a grim picture on Friday as U.S. retail sales and manufacturing output showed record declines in April due to virus-related stay-at-home orders.
The data came after U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up trade tensions with China by moving to block semiconductor shipments to China s Huawei Technologies from global chipmakers. The trade worries sent the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) down more than 2%.
China was swift to respond with a report saying it was ready to put U.S. companies on an ""unreliable entity list,"" according to the Global Times.
The combination of trade tensions and weak data had sent S&P 500 down around 1.3% earlier in the session but for much of the afternoon session it oscillated between positive and negative territory. 
""We got the Friday jitters on China trade but late this afternoon the market turned its focus on reopenings,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. 
""We re smack in the middle of May and think this might be the worst of the economic numbers. There s a chance they start to slowly turn positive,"" said Augustine citing moves by most states to at least partially reopen their economies. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 60.08 points, or 0.25%, to 23,685.42, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 11.2 points, or 0.39%, to 2,863.7 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 70.84 points, or 0.79%, to 9,014.56.
However, for the week S&P 500 fell 2.3%, for its biggest weekly drop since the week of March 20. The Dow dropped 2.7% for the week while the Nasdaq declined 1.2%, marking their biggest weekly drops since the week ended April 3.
Six of the 11 major S&P sectors closed higher, led by a 1.3% gain in communications services (SPLRCL). Utilities (SPLRCU) was the weakest with a 1.4% drop followed by a 0.7% drop in financial stocks (SPSY). 
""Today has very much been about this battle of conflicting factors,"" said Ed Perks, multi-asset solutions  chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton, adding that without ""something that s going to give us direction"" investors are viewing it as a lackluster Friday after a long week. 
The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) outperformed, with a 1.6% gain. One of its stocks, Sorrento Therapeutics Inc , closed 158% higher after its experimental antibody candidate showed potential in blocking COVID-19 infections in early studies.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday moved to block global chip supplies to blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], spurring fears of Chinese retaliation and hammering shares of U.S. producers of chipmaking equipment.
A new rule, unveiled by the Commerce Department and first reported by Reuters, expands U.S. authority to require licenses for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology, vastly expanding its reach to halt exports to the world s No. 2 smartphone maker. 
""This action puts America first, American companies first, and American national security first,"" a senior Commerce Department official told reporters in a telephone briefing on Friday. 
Huawei, the world s top telecoms equipment maker, did not respond to a request for comment.
News of the move against the firm hit European stocks as traders sold into the day s gains, while shares of chip equipment makers such as Lam Research  and KLA Corp  fell around 5% and 3%, respectively, in U.S. trading. 
The reaction from China was swift, with a report on Friday by China s Global Times saying Beijing was ready to put U.S. companies on an ""unreliable entity list,"" as part of countermeasures in response to the new limits on Huawei.
The measures include launching investigations and imposing restrictions on U.S. companies such as Apple Inc , Cisco Systems Inc  and  Qualcomm Inc  , as well as suspending purchases of  Boeing Co   airplanes, the report said https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188491.shtml, citing a source.
The Commerce Department s rule, effective Friday but with a 120-day grace period, also hits Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), the biggest contract chipmaker and key Huawei supplier, which announced plans to build a U.S.-based plant on Thursday. 
TSMC said on Friday it is ""following the U.S. export rule change closely"" and working with outside counsel to ""conduct legal analysis and ensure a comprehensive examination and interpretation of these rules.""
The department said the rule is aimed at preventing Huawei from continuing to ""undermine"" its status as a blacklisted company, meaning suppliers of U.S.-made sophisticated technology must seek a U.S. government license before selling to it.
""There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been in able, in effect, to use U.S. technology with foreign fab producers,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business News on Friday, calling the rule change a ""highly tailored thing to try to correct that loophole.""
The company was added to the Commerce Department s ""entity list"" last year due to national security concerns, amid accusations from Washington that it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and can spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.
Frustration among China hawks in the administration that Huawei s entity listing was not doing enough to curb its access to supplies prompted an effort, first reported by Reuters in November, to crack down on the company that culminated in Friday s rule.
Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official, said the rule appeared to be a ""novel, complex expansion of U.S. export controls"" for chip-related items made with U.S. technology abroad and sent to Huawei. But he stressed that chips designed by companies other than Huawei and manufactured with U.S. technology could still be sold to the company without the license requirement. 
While the new rules will apply to chips regardless of their level of sophistication, a senior U.S. State Department official who also briefed reporters Friday opened the door to some flexibility for the company, echoing reprieves granted to Huawei by the Trump administration previously. 
""This is a licensing requirement. It does not necessarily mean that things are denied,"" the official said, adding that the rule gives the U.S. government greater ""visibility"" into the shipments. ""What are done with those applications, we ll have to see ... Each application will be judged on its merits.""
After essentially barring Huawei from buying from U.S. suppliers, the Commerce Department granted licenses to some of Huawei’s biggest U.S. partners to continue to sell to the company, while also allowing smaller rural telecoms companies to continue to purchase Huawei equipment to keep their networks up and running. 
Huawei, which needs semiconductors for its smartphones and telecoms equipment, has found itself at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China, whose relationship has soured in recent months over the origins of the deadly coronavirus. 
While the rule change is aimed at squeezing Huawei and will hit the chip foundries it relies on, U.S. manufacturers of chipmaking equipment could face long-term pain, if chipmakers develop new equipment sources beyond the reach of U.S. rules. 
But for now, most chipmakers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials , which did not respond to requests for comment.
While some of the complex tools required to make chips come from companies outside the United States, such as Japan s Tokyo Electron (T:8035) and Hitachi (T:6501) and the Netherlands  ASML , analysts say it would be difficult to put together an entire toolchain for making advanced semiconductors without at least some American equipment.
The burden of dealing with the new rule is most likely to be felt by foundries such as TSMC that buy the tools, rather than U.S. semiconductor firms such as Qualcomm Inc  or  Nvidia Corp   that tap such foundries as part of their supply chain.

""We are concerned this rule may create uncertainty and disruption for the global semiconductor supply chain, but it seems to be less damaging to the U.S. semiconductor industry than the very broad approaches previously considered,"" Semiconductor Industry Association Chief Executive John Neuffer said in a statement."

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. fund managers piled into big-name technology stocks and bottom-fished in the beaten-down energy sector as markets reeled from the coronavirus-fueled selloff in the first quarter, regulatory filings released on Friday showed. 
They also cut exposure in restaurants, retail and airlines as the mounting number of deaths from the coronavirus -- which have now topped 86,000 in the United States -- forced shutdowns of virtually all nonessential businesses in most U.S. states.
The first quarter was marked by a 20% plunge in the Standard & Poor s 500 index and a swelling of the jobless ranks by the millions. While the filings are backward-looking, they give a glimpse of what investors did during a historic stock market selloff and the start of an economic crisis that is being likened to the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Technology giants including  Microsoft Corp  , Amazon.com Inc , Apple Inc , Google owner Alphabet  Inc and  Facebook Inc   saw fresh buying from fund managers as their earnings were expected to stay comparatively steady this year. Hedge funds Viking Global Investors, Maverick Capital, Moore Capital Management and Arrowstreet Capital all increased their positions in Microsoft, which reported sharp demand for its Microsoft Teams product as offices and schools transitioned online as stay-in-place orders forced Americans to work and study from home.
Stanley Druckenmiller s Duquesne Family Office increased its holding in Amazon by 713%. Amazon shares hit an all-time high on April 30 thanks in part to rising demand for consumer products at a time when many small retailers have closed. Druckenmiller also raised his investment in Facebook by 75%, the filing shows.
CONTRARIAN BETS
Several prominent fund managers took contrarian bets on the energy sector as a supply glut caused the price of oil to tumble to 20-year lows and briefly turned oil futures negative in April for the first time in history. 
Dmitry Balyasny s Balyasny Asset Management bought an additional 2.9 million shares in oil and natural gas exploration company  Noble Energy  , raising its stake by 565%. Cinctive Capital Management, a new hedge fund that employs teams of traders like Balyasny, increased its position in Noble  by 300%. Noble s stock has surged 89% since March 23. Cinctive also bought into  Valero Energy  , whose stock price has jumped 85% since March 23.
As segments of the U.S. economy were shuttered by the lockdowns, fund managers hustled out of stocks that would suffer as business ground to a halt. Viking cut its stake in ride-hailing company Uber Technologies  by 31% while Coatue Management reduced its Uber ownership by 58%, the filings show. 
Coatue also liquidated its position in retailer J.C. Penney, which is expected to file for bankruptcy soon, by selling 3.4 million shares.
With travel stalled, casinos and resorts struggled. Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price cut its stake in MGM Resorts  International, which owns the Bellagio in Las Vegas, 30% by selling 16 million shares.
But some hedge funds saw opportunity in the hospitality industry. Viking added a new position in  Las Vegas Sands   Corp, while hedge fund Long Pond Capital added new positions in MGM Resorts and Marriott Vacations, and more than tripled its existing position in Wyndham Hotel and Resorts, bringing it to more than 8% of its portfolio.
Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund manager in the world, sold its entire stake in several large financial companies, including Bank of America ,  Wells Fargo   and Goldman Sachs . 
The firm added positions in consumer staples such as  General Mills   and bulk retailer Costco . Bridgewater also added a position in  General Electric  , whose shares have fallen by more than 50% since January to a three-decade low amid concerns about cratering demand in the airline industry. "

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) said on Friday it has sold much of its stake in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc , despite the billionaire s assurance that the banking sector was not a ""primary worry"" for him during the coronavirus pandemic.
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed investments as of March 31, Berkshire said its Goldman stake fell 84% to 1.9 million shares, from 12 million at year-end, with the stake s market value dropping to $297 million from $2.76 billion.
Goldman s stock price fell about 33% during the quarter, and some of Berkshire s selling appears to have occurred after the slide began.
Berkshire sold its remaining small stakes in the insurer Travelers Cos  and oil refiner Phillips 66 , and tweaked several holdings. Its stake in  Wells Fargo  & Co  was unchanged, though the stock s price fell 47%.
A request for comment to Buffett s assistant was not immediately returned. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and its namesake energy business.
Investors monitor Berkshire s quarterly filings to see where Buffett and his portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs see value. Buffett normally directs larger investments such as Apple Inc .
The Goldman stake originated in a $5 billion preferred stock investment at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, in a vote of confidence by Buffett for the Wall Street bank.
Berkshire s selling was disclosed after Buffett said at the May 2 annual shareholders  meeting of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate that banks were now well-capitalized and capable of weathering economic distress from the pandemic.
""If problems become severe enough in an economy, even strong banks can be under a lot of stress, and we ll be very glad we ve got the Federal Reserve system standing behind them,"" he said.
""Overall the banking system is not going to be the problem,"" he added. ""They are not a primary worry of mine at all.""
Berkshire remains a major shareholder in  American Express  , Bank of America , Bank of New York Mellon , JPMorgan Chase , PNC Financial , US Bancorp  and Wells Fargo.
Maeve DuVally, a Goldman spokeswoman, declined immediate comment.
Doug Kass, managing partner at Seabreeze Capital Investment Inc, called the Goldman stock sale ""not surprising,"" following Berkshire s sale of 6.3 million Goldman shares in the fourth quarter.

Berkshire ended March with a record $137.3 billion of cash, disappointing investors unhappy with the low yields it generates for the company. The cash stake likely rose in April as Berkshire sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines: American , Delta , Southwest  and United ."

The Justice Department is also moving toward bringing a case as soon as this summer, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 
Shares of Alphabet fell about 1.5% in after-hours trading.
Google - along with  Facebook Inc  , Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc  - are under a series of probes into allegations that the tech behemoths use their clout to unfairly defend their market share, including one by the House Judiciary Committee s antitrust panel.
The federal probe of Google focuses on search, advertising and management of its Android operating system. The Federal Trade Commission settled an antitrust investigation of Google in 2013 with a reprimand.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the multi-state investigation, said they were talking to companies who said that they had been hurt by the search and advertising giant.
""Our antitrust investigation into Google has not been slowed down by the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said in a statement. ""We hope to have the investigation wrapped up by fall. If we determine that filing is merited, we will go to court soon after that.""
Paxton said in February he has not taken any possible punishment off the table, including breaking up the search and advertising giant.
Google said it would not comment on speculation about the potential for litigation. 
""We continue to engage with the ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Attorney General Paxton, and we don’t have any updates or comments on speculation,"" a Google spokesperson said in an email statement.
The Justice Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The four tech giants, which are powerhouses in search and online advertising, social media, online sales and smartphones, have caused concern among progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans alike because of their outsized clout.

The Justice Department is believed to be looking at all four companies while the FTC is probing Facebook and Amazon.com. Dozens of state attorneys general, led by New York, are also investigating Facebook. "

NEW YORK(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday with plans to permanently close some stores and also explore a possible sale, making it the latest brick-and-mortar retailer to crumble as prolonged store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic drive a final stake through long-troubled businesses. 
The U.S. department store chain, known for selling family apparel, cosmetics and jewelry at roughly 850 locations, said it reached an agreement with existing lenders for $900 million of debtor-in-possession financing to aid operations while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings in federal court in Corpus Christi, Texas.
The loan consists of $450 million in fresh financing, the company said. The balance is made up of existing debt being ""rolled up"" to be given the same legal status as the new funding that J.C. Penney obtained, people familiar with the matter said. The retailer said it had an additional $500 million in cash on hand before the bankruptcy filing.
While J.C. Penney plans to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings after eliminating several billion dollars of debt, it will also explore a sale as part of the terms of its new financing, the company said. Reuters earlier reported that the company was nearing a bankruptcy filing and negotiating the financing. 
The company on Friday said it would begin closing some stores permanently in phases and would disclose further details in coming weeks. People familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that the company initially plans to permanently shutter roughly 200 stores, saying the figure could fluctuate depending on negotiations with creditors.
The bankruptcy filing caps a long decline for the 118-year-old department store chain, which once operated more than 1,600 locations that became fixtures in U.S. malls. The company at one point employed nearly 200,000 people. 
Even before the coronavirus outbreak, J.C. Penney was struggling with nearly $4 billion of debt and pressure from both discount retailers and e-commerce companies. 
Larger retailers such as Walmart  Inc and  Target  Corp  have squeezed smaller rivals by offering bargain-price apparel, including online. 
IN THE FOOTSTEP OF OTHER BANKRUPTCIES
The coronavirus outbreak, which has resulted in more than 80,000 deaths in the United States, is now forcing a financial reckoning among an array of retailers that had to temporarily close their doors under states  orders. Other retailers already grappling with customers  abandonment of traditional stores for online shopping have also resorted to bankruptcy filings. 
Earlier this month, both luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus Group and clothing retailer J. Crew Group Inc filed for bankruptcy protection after alternative attempts to rework their finances failed. Stage Stores Inc, a U.S. department store chain selling mid-priced apparel at hundreds of stores in mostly rural areas, said earlier this week it would liquidate unless it finds a buyer.
Like other retailers, J.C. Penney has started reopening its stores in stages as many states have begun to loosen coronavirus restrictions. But with U.S. unemployment now at the highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s, there are serious concerns that consumer spending will remain dampened for a prolonged stretch. 
Against that backdrop, J.C. Penney faced a looming $105 million debt payment in June and $300 million of annual interest expenses. Adding to pressure was an unprecedented span of lost sales and uncertainty whether shoppers concerned about their health would return to stores.
J.C. Penney negotiated with creditors earlier this year for more financial breathing room, hoping to give its new chief executive, Jill Soltau, additional time to forge a turnaround focused on the company s roots as a seller of affordable apparel for middle-class families. The talks did not bear fruit.
The coronavirus crisis forced J.C. Penney to prepare for a bankruptcy filing to address its strained finances, which on the horizon included more than $2 billion of debt coming due in 2023. 
In March, the company drew down $1.25 billion from its credit line. It later skipped debt payments, triggering grace periods to make good before defaulting that expired this week. The company made one of those overdue payments before filing for bankruptcy.
Under one plan being discussed, J.C. Penney would emerge from bankruptcy as two separate companies, the sources said. One would own some of the company s real estate and serve as a landlord to the other entity that would operate the retailer s business, they said. Creditors, many of them Wall Street hedge funds, would control the businesses in exchange for forgiving debt, they said. 
The company earlier this month resolved a legal dispute with Sephora, the French beauty chain owned by LVMH that had threatened to end its agreement to sell cosmetics inside J.C. Penney stores. 
Days before seeking bankruptcy protection, J.C. Penney paid nearly $10 million in bonuses to top executives. The company said it was ""taking necessary steps to retain our talented management team,"" which made strides on the company s turnaround plan before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
FROM RURAL ROOTS TO U.S. MAINSTAY
James Cash Penney founded the eponymous retailer with partners in 1902. Averse to the haggling that was common at the time, he believed prices should be low, set and marked, an attitude that served as a precursor to modern shopping, according to the J.C. Penney Museum in Hamilton, Missouri, the founder s hometown. 
The company s first store, opened in Wyoming, was called ""The Golden Rule,"" a reference to what the retailer viewed as its standard for customer service, according to its website. 
J.C. Penney stores initially dotted Main Streets in rural towns dominated by farmers. After expanding to operate more than 30 stores, it went public in 1929. 
By the 1970s, J.C. Penney had become a mainstay across the United States. The following decade, it acquired a bank, and later drugstores before eventually divesting both businesses. 
The e-commerce revolution that took root in the 21st century rocked nearly every corner of the traditional retail landscape and eroded J.C. Penney s business much as it did those of its rivals. In recent years, J.C. Penney has closed hundreds of stores and cut thousands of jobs. 
The company has also faced fierce competition from discount chains including TJX  Cos Inc’s Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
J.C. Penney suffered a significant setback after a failed transformation attempt spearheaded by former CEO Ron Johnson, the one-time pioneer of Apple Inc  s retail stores. Johnson launched expensive renovations of J.C. Penney locations and eliminated coupons, resulting in a customer backlash that led to plunging sales. He was replaced in 2013.
Soltau took the reins in late 2018 after a revolving door of executives, and attempted to return J.C. Penney to its roots as a seller of affordable apparel for middle-class families. She jettisoned the company s appliance business and mostly abandoned its furniture offerings.

763,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/global-chipmaking-kingpin-gets-dragged-into-uschina-trade-war-2174958,2020-05-18,Global Chipmaking Kingpin Gets Dragged into U.S.-China Trade War By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Since its founding more than three decades ago, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has built its business by working behind the scenes to make customers like Apple Inc . and Qualcomm  Inc. shine. Now the low-profile chipmaker has landed squarely in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, an incalculably valuable asset that both sides are vying to control.
The Trump administration opened up a new front in the conflict on Friday by barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying China’s Huawei Technologies Co. without U.S. government approval. That means TSMC and rivals will have to cut off Huawei unless they get waivers from the U.S. Commerce Dept.
That would be a financial blow for TSMC, which gets an estimated 14% of its revenue from Huawei, but more importantly it risks provoking retribution from the Chinese government, which already views Taiwan as a breakaway province that belongs to the mainland. The Communist Party has vowed to protect Huawei, a company it regards as a national champion for its success in becoming the world’s top producer of telecommunications equipment -- and a dominant force in the rollout of fifth-generation or 5G networks.
“China likely will retaliate, and investors should brace themselves for a possible trade war escalation,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a research note on Friday.
Read more: U.S. Tightens Rules to Crack Down on Huawei’s Chip Supply
The latest restrictions inject fresh turmoil into a complex international ecosystem that produces computer parts, while escalating a campaign to contain Huawei’s and China’s technological ascent by cutting it off from vital gear. The U.S. already blacklisted Huawei last year, preventing American companies from supplying the Chinese company unless they got a license. The latest move tightens those restrictions to prevent chipmakers -- American or foreign -- from working with Huawei and its secretive chip-design unit HiSilicon on the cutting-edge semiconductors they need to make smartphones and communications equipment. The Trump administration sees Huawei as a dire security threat, an allegation the company denies.
“We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a tweet.
The U.S. decision is likely to hurt not just Huawei and TSMC, but also a clutch of American players including gear-makers Applied Materials Inc ., KLA and  Lam Research Corp  . themselves,  Morgan Stanley   analysts wrote. Disruptions to Huawei’s production will also hurt U.S. Customers from Micron Technology Inc . and Qorvo  Inc. to Texas Instruments  Inc., they said. But “it bears repeating that any escalation of trade tensions is negative for the stocks overall,” they wrote in a research report.
It would have been impossible to imagine TSMC becoming such a coveted chit between the world’s great powers when it was founded in 1987. Morris Chang, born in China and trained in the U.S., started the company as a so-called foundry, manufacturing semiconductors for any customer that didn’t want to construct its own fabrication facility, or fab.
At the time, the business wasn’t nearly as glamorous as making chips yourself. Dominating the industry at the time were companies like  Intel Corp  . and Advanced Micro Devices  Inc., which made processors for personal computers. “Real men have fabs,” AMD co-founder Jerry Sanders would say, making clear that was an insult.
But in the intervening years, the foundry industry has become far more strategic for the technology industry. Customers from Apple and Huawei to Qualcomm and Nvidia  Corp. have found they can innovate more quickly if they focus on chip designs and then turn to foundries like TSMC to produce them. Innovators in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence or the internet of things also depend on foundries to crack open new markets.
Today, many of the chips for mobile phones, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and any other key technology are made at foundries. TSMC has become the leading foundry in the world by investing heavily in ever more advanced fabs, with annual capital spending of about $16 billion this year.
It can now manufacture at 5 nanometers, about twice the width of human DNA, while China’s top foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., or SMIC, is at 14 nanometers. That makes TSMC’s chips far more powerful and energy efficient.
Huawei and HiSilicon will have few good options if they are cut off from TSMC. One possibility is to procure off-the-shelf chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics  Co., an option Huawei’s rotating Chairman Eric Xu mentioned in late March. But even that may no longer be viable under the new Commerce restrictions.
SMIC itself is keen on moving up the technology ladder, eyeing a secondary share listing that could raise more than $3 billion on top of a large capital infusion from the state.

But that’s a longer-term endeavor and Huawei’s products meanwhile are likely to suffer, putting them at risk of falling behind those of rivals like Apple or Xiaomi  Corp.
For TSMC, it’s growing ever more difficult to remain neutral amid the growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The company brands itself “everybody’s foundry,” effectively the Switzerland of the tech industry. It supplies Chinese customers like Huawei and the American military, while relying on U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment like Applied Materials and Lam Research.
TSMC did take one step closer to the U.S. last week, saying it would build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona. The Department of Defense has expressed concern that overseas fabs may be vulnerable to cyberattacks and domestic manufacturing would assure a more reliable supply of chips.
The proposal appears to be carefully calculated to address such security issues without too much damage to profits or its political balancing act. Suppliers to the military, such as  Xilinx Inc  ., would be able to use the U.S. fab, but the facility would likely account for less than 5% of revenue so margins won’t be compromised.
It’s not clear if the plans for a U.S. plant will win TSMC leniency in supplying Huawei, however.
“TSMC will not be granted or granted a license based on their intent to build a 5 nanometer fab here in the United States. That’s not part of it at all,” Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department, told reporters on a call. “There’s no assurance on that and we don’t anticipate that.”
Meanwhile, China appears to be preparing to retaliate for the new restrictions on Huawei. On Friday, the Global Times -- a Chinese tabloid run by the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party -- reported Beijing was ready to initiate countermeasures, including imposing restrictions on Apple, suspending the purchase of Boeing  airplanes and putting U.S. companies on an ‘unreliable entity list.’
The list will cover “foreign entities that cause actual or potential damage to Chinese companies and industries,” the newspaper said.

The iPhone maker in March shut all its stores outside of Greater China in response to the spread of the coronavirus. It started shutting its more than 50 Greater China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. 
""Our commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe,"" Deirdre O Brien, Apple s head of retail, wrote on Sunday in a note on the company s website. 
The stores will impose social-distancing rules, limit occupancy and some will offer only curbside or storefront service, she said. 
Apple does not disclose its retail store revenue. Direct sales, including retail stores, web and corporate sales, accounted for 31% of its $260 billion in 2019 revenue.
Chief Executive Tim Cook declined last month to provide an outlook for the June quarter, citing business uncertainty created by the virus. First-quarter sales in China, reflecting that country s store closings and lockdown, were $9.46 billion, about $1 billion less than for the same period a year earlier. 
Last week, Apple reopened its first five stores in the United States, requiring customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the premises.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned over the weekend that the U.S. economy could ""easily"" contract by 20%-30% amid the pandemic, and that the economic downturn might last until late 2021.
However, he also told CBS’s 60 Minutes program that “we’re not out of ammunition by a long shot” as he said the Fed could enlarge existing lending programs or start new ones. Powell is due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.
On Friday, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed an additional $3 trillion coronavirus relief package. However, it is not expected to pass the Republican-majority Senate.
This comes as more and more states start to reopen their economies. The Trump administration offered up reopening guidelines just over a month ago, and since then more than 30 states have partially reopened.
This positive news has tended to overshadow the latest salvo in war of words between China and the U.S. over the coronavirus outbreak. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro had accused China of knowingly spreading the virus around the world while concealing its full knowledge of the outbreak.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI cracked the iPhone encryption of the Royal Saudi Air Force trainee who killed three American sailors in a December attack at a naval base in Florida, and found evidence linking him to al Qaeda, Attorney General William Barr said on Monday.
The shooter, Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, also wounded eight people before being killed by law enforcement during the Dec. 6, 2019 attack. 
He was on the base as part of a U.S. Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies.
The Justice Department succeeded in unlocking the encryption on the shooter s iPhone after Apple Inc  declined to do so, Barr told reporters on a conference call. Apple later disputed his version, saying it cooperated to the extent that its technology allowed.
""The information from the phone has already proved invaluable,"" Barr said.
Barr called on Congress to take action forcing Apple and other tech companies to help law enforcement agencies get through encryption during criminal investigations.
""Apple s decision has dangerous consequences,"" Barr said. ""Many of the technology companies that advocate most loudly for warrant-proof encryption ... are at the same time willing to accommodate authoritarian regimes.""
Apple said: ""It is because we take our responsibility to national security so seriously that we do not believe in the creation of a backdoor — one which will make every device vulnerable to bad actors,"" Apple said in a statement. ""There is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys, and the American people do not have to choose between weakening encryption and effective investigations.""
In February, an audio recording purporting to be from the Islamist militant group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the attack, but provided no evidence.
Prior to the shooting spree, the shooter posted criticism of U.S. wars and quoted slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on social media.
""The Pensacola attack was actually the brutal culmination of years of planning,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Monday, adding that evidence showed Alshamrani had been radicalized by 2015.
Barr has said the Saudi government did not have any advanced warnings of the shooting.

Saudi Arabia in January withdrew its remaining 21 cadets from the U.S. military training program and brought them home, after the Justice Department s investigation revealed some had accessed child pornography or had social media accounts containing Islamic extremist or anti-American content."

Figures on movement, restaurant bookings and energy consumption show the pickup in activity as governments ease back on some of the restrictions they’ve imposed over the past two months.
The movement isn’t uniform, with some countries moving more slowly than others, and the region’s economy remains far from full speed. Schools, for example, have opened in some countries but not in others, and it’s a similar situation for bars and restaurants.
But it’s a start, after weeks of lockdown, and high frequency data sources are capturing some of the changes taking place across Europe.
Many countries restricted people’s movement -- one hour of exercise close to the home, plus essential shopping only, for example. That clampdown is clearly reflected in Apple  mobility data, which shows a sharp drop in March. Now, those readings are starting to rise again, as people are allowed to travel more freely, some stores reopen and people return to work. Austria was among the first to ease lockdown measures -- and it shows.
Countries have different timetables for restaurants and bars, particularly because it can be hard to adhere to social distancing advice in such places.
Germany allowed restaurants to throw open their doors again last week, and patrons are returning. According to data from booking website OpenTable, the year-on-year drop in reservations has eased to less than 80% from 100% at the start of the month. Many people may remain cautious given that the virus is still a risk, but for others, it’s a chance to get out after two months of home cooking and take-out.
In the U.K., the lockdown put the housing market into stasis. One measure of sales plunged to minus 92. The low during the financial crisis was just minus 55.
Now, with property viewings allowed again, prospective buyers and sellers who could do nothing but wait are jumping back in. Website Zoopla said traffic on its website is rising again, while hits on Rightmove  are also up.
Power demand is a key metric for tracking economic recovery across the region. In Italy, electricity demand is 3.4% higher since it began reopening on May 5. It was the worst affected country in Europe, with power use down as much as 28% during several weeks in April compared with a year earlier.
German demand has increased 4% since measures were eased on April 23. Here, the drop off was less marked with heavy industry that processes chemicals and steel able to continue operations. Britain has started to fall behind other nations with power demand yet to see much of a come back.
The labor market has taken the brunt of the economic fallout, with millions of people out of work or furloughed, and companies scaling back hiring plans. But job postings appear to have stabilized, and increased moderately in some cases. They are still far below the level at the start of the year.
Using data from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker, Bjorn van Roye and Tom Orlik at Bloomberg Economics have investigated the relationship between lockdowns and the economy: on average a 10-point increase in lockdown stringency results in a 4% drop in activity. Yet the headline result masks differences between countries.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  Corp (T:6758) said on Tuesday it will turn its listed financial arm, Sony  Financial Holdings Inc (T:8729), into a wholly owned unit through a tender offer worth about 400 billion yen ($3.72 billion).
The deal will allow the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant to strengthen its presence in the fintech field to compete with global tech majors such as  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  and Apple Inc .
It also reflects Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida s strategy of making revenue streams more stable following a major revamp by his predecessor which shifted Sony s focus away from low-margin consumer electronics to entertainment content and subscription-based businesses.
The deal is the biggest strategic move for Sony under Yoshida since a $2.3 billion acquisition of EMI Music Publishing, announced soon after Yoshida took the helm in 2018.
""The financial business has a stable profit base in Japan,"" Yoshida told reporters and analysts in a briefing. Taking full control of the business ""will help us hedge growing geopolitical risks.""
Sony, which will change its name to Sony Group next year, already owns 65% of Sony Financial. It offers about 2,600 yen for each remaining Sony Financial share - a premium of about 26% over Monday s closing price of 2,064 yen. The tender offer closes in July.
Sony Financial, a consistently stable revenue source for Sony, has banking, life and non-life insurance, credit card and nursing care businesses in Japan with about 11,000 staff. Total assets stood at 14.5 trillion yen as of the end of last year.
It contributed operating profit of 129.6 billion yen in the year ended in March, or about 15% of the group.
Sony expects the acquisition to have a positive tax-related impact of 40 billion to 50 billion yen annually on net profit.
The plan, first reported by the Nikkei business daily earlier on Tuesday, sent shares of Sony Financial up nearly 17% to 2,412 yen before trading of the stock was suspended. Sony Corp shares rose 3.3% in a broader market that ended up 1.5%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House advisory panel on Tuesday urged the government and private industry to work together on new technological infrastructure to support future jobs and underpin a solid economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The White House American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, co-chaired by White House adviser Ivanka Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, called for ""an unprecedented investment in digital infrastructure."" Members include Apple Inc  Chief Executive Tim Cook,  Lockheed Martin  Corp  Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson and International Business Machines Corp  Executive Chairman Ginni Rometty. 
The board ""was focused on solving these challenges even prior to covid 19, but the pandemic has accelerated our need to take action,"" said Barbara Humpton, CEO of Siemens USA. 
The board s efforts are aimed at helping connect displaced workers with pathways to upgrade their skills and learn new ones so they can move into ""good jobs in rebounding fields as the health crisis abates and the economy begins to recover,"" according to a White House official briefed on the plan.
The board wants governments ""to streamline occupational licensing, education requirements, reduce the cost of licensing, and increase reciprocity"" and urges the federal government to ""allow student financial aid for high-quality, short-term, market-aligned credential programs."" 
Workforce issues have taken on new importance as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the economy.
The United States lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.
In a statement, Ross said the advisory board s meeting comes at a ""challenging"" time, but expressed confidence the president s policies will lead to a rapid rebound. 
Ivanka Trump said in a separate statement the board will work to find ""solutions to combat the job loss caused by this pandemic and help the unemployed get reconnected to the workforce.""
""By rallying around this call to action, leaders in business and government can help more people build skills that lead to good jobs, promote hiring that is based on skills not just degrees, and build a national skills infrastructure to connect workers with opportunities,""  IBM  s Rometty said in a statement.
Four major companies - Walmart Inc , Salesforce , IBM and  Workday Inc   - are announcing Tuesday they are creating ""Interoperable Learning Records"" to help workers and employers match applicants with jobs, the official said.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - When a senior living facility in Amarillo, Texas suspected a nurse may have caught the novel coronavirus this month, it had a list within five minutes of staff and residents the nurse could have infected. 
High-tech wristbands worn by The Legacy at Town Square  s 35 workers and 49 residents expedited contact tracing, the otherwise pain-staking process of interviewing patients to determine who crossed paths with them. 
The nurse tested negative an hour later and Legacy did not have to isolate or test others. But its experience shows how wristbands and other wearables have emerged as tools to automatically record encounters between people at places that can mandate their use.
Facilities with quick contact tracing following infections in the coming months will be better positioned to ward off outbreaks and stay open, according to epidemiologists.
""It makes you ready to make the best operational decisions at a moment’s notice,"" said Joseph Walter, executive director at LifeWell Senior Living s Legacy facility.
Australia, Singapore and other governments have sought to enable smartphones to record people s contacts. But data privacy rules imposed by smartphone software makers Apple Inc  and Alphabet Inc s  Google limit the utility of smartphone-based systems, while many employers do not let workers carry phones because of security and safety considerations.
Manufacturers are hawking wearables online priced as low as $4. 
The Legacy in Texas uses technology from CarePredict, a startup that added contact tracing functionality to its system for elderly care homes when the pandemic struck. 
CarePredict s Tempo bracelets function as a call button to summon staff, a digital room key, and a health and activity tracker. More than 20 care facilities in the United States have the devices, which cost about $1 per day per user, according to CarePredict. 
The wristbands use infrared light to connect to beacons on a wall in each room, creating a record of who has been near whom, where and for how long. 
Walter said the system has proved accurate over the last two years for tracking residents  activities at The Legacy, but its reliability in contact tracing is yet to be seen. 
Setting up beacons and special-purpose devices like CarePredict s Tempo may be too costly and complex for some facilities. But wearables that communicate with each other through Bluetooth signals may be more suitable, and software development company Myplanet and automaker  Ford Motor Co   are among those testing popular Bluetooth-based fitness trackers and smartwatches from companies such as  Fitbit Inc   and Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930). 
One of Myplanet s experiments found that companies hoping to reduce costs and hassles by allowing workers to use existing gadgets will face connection challenges because of variances in the devices  Bluetooth technology, said Greg Fields, who is leading the Toronto-based firm s contact tracing efforts for its multinational clients.
Apple and Google soon plan to release contact tracing technology to smooth out some of the connection issues on phones, and device makers are confident that the tech giants will do the same for wearables, said David Su, CEO at Atmosic, a Silicon Valley-based wireless chip company. 
The companies did not respond to requests for comment on the speculation. While Apple-Google technology would improve reliability in contact tracing, devices that use it would need access to the internet and a government-authorized contact tracing app.
Ford conducted a small test of pricey smartwatches that alert wearers when they are standing closer than guidelines allow, but they too require Wi-Fi, which is sometimes unavailable in sprawling plants, Ford manufacturing chief Gary Johnson told Reuters. 

The automaker also is testing chips on identification badges, he said, and those could track sustained encounters or issue reminders to keep distance."

TSMC, the world s biggest contract chipmaker and supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc , announced the project last week, in a move trumpeted by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as signaling a ""renaissance in American manufacturing"" fueled by President Donald Trump. 
In a letter addressed Tuesday to Ross and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and two colleagues said they ""strongly support"" efforts by the administration to ""on-shore"" semiconductor plants in the United States. 
But Schumer, along with Patrick Leahy and Jack Reed, urged more transparency and asked the government to consider ""companies that already have built a significant presence in the U.S."", citing Micron , GlobalFoundries and Cree . 
""We have serious questions as to how this project takes into consideration national security requirements and how it aligns with a broader strategy for building a diverse U.S. semiconductor manufacturing supply chain,"" the men wrote of the TSMC plan. 
""We ask that you cease any such negotiations or discussions until you have briefed the relevant authorization and appropriations committees with your plans, including any commitments you have made to funding, tax breaks, licensures, or other incentives,"" they added. 
Commerce, the Pentagon and TSMC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
TSMC, which is a key supplier to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, has found itself in the cross fire of a global technology battle between Washington and Beijing.

The Taiwanese firm will likely be hit by a new U.S. rule aimed at curbing global chip supplies to Huawei, which it placed on a black list last year on national security grounds. But the U.S. government also negotiated with TSMC for years to open a U.S.-based plant, Reuters reported, as it seeks to bring more chip manufacturing onshore."

In its annual recommendations to the bloc s 27 countries, called the European Semester, the EU executive said the EU should coordinate its approach to economic recovery once the coronavirus pandemic subsides.
""This Spring semester package has been recast and streamlined to provide guidance to our Member States as they navigate their way through the storm.

""That also means everyone must pay their share: there can be no place for aggressive tax planning in a Europe of solidarity and fairness,"" he said in an apparent swipe at tech giants like Google , Apple , Facebook  and Amazon , which the EU has long argued are not paying their fair share of taxes where they make money.

(Reuters) - The regulation of big technology companies such as  Facebook Inc   and Alphabet  Inc s Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.
Here is a look at the stances of Republican President Donald Trump and his likely Democratic opponent Joe Biden on some key tech policy issues:
BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly administration of President Barack Obama, has criticized Facebook and other tech giants during his campaign and proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc .
Trump, who has mixed relationships with tech companies, regularly bashing Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos but meeting with Apple Inc  s Tim Cook, has said ""there is something going on in terms of monopoly"" when asked about big tech firms. 
The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies, but both he and Biden have stopped short of calling for the firms to be broken up. 
Biden has said dismantling companies like Facebook was ""something we should take a really hard look at.""
REGULATING SOCIAL MEDIA
Both Biden and Trump have blasted social media companies over their handling of political content. Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused the companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives. 
Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its policies on political ads and manipulated videos, was the only Democratic presidential candidate who called for revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a key internet law which largely exempts online platforms like Facebook and Twitter from legal liability for users  posts.
In 2018, Trump signed into law a bill that makes websites liable for third-party content that facilitates prostitution or sex trafficking. But this year, in a win for tech firms, Trump also signed a trade deal that means tech companies will have U.S.-style liability protections for online content when operating in Mexico and Canada.
DATA PRIVACY
Congress has been trying to build consensus on a federal consumer privacy legislation, which the Trump administration has signaled support for. Biden has said the U.S. should set privacy ""standards not unlike the Europeans,"" an apparent reference to the European Union s stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The Trump administration has criticized Silicon Valley over the issue of encryption, blasting Apple for what he called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals. 
Privacy advocates have also slammed the Trump administration for actions they say violate immigrants  privacy and for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of their data.
DIGITAL DIVIDE
The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband.
Trump has said he is committed to ensuring ""every citizen can have high-speed internet access,"" though Democratic rivals criticized him over the continuing digital divide on the campaign trail. In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund. 

Biden also said he plans a $20 billion investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations."

HBO Max is launching at a time when demand for new content is high - as more people are staying home due to the coronavirus - but consumers  income may have taken a hit as a result of the pandemic. The service will cost $15 per month for non-AT&T customers; WarnerMedia is also offering lower-cost promotional deals and has said HBO Max will be free to some AT&T customers at launch.
HBO Max will enter a crowded streaming landscape dominated by Netflix Inc , Walt  Disney   Co-owned Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video. It will include 10,000 hours of content from WarnerMedia brands and libraries such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Cartoon Network. At launch it will include six original titles, including the underground ballroom dance competition series ""Legendary"" and a Sesame Workshop children s show ""The Not Too Late Show with Elmo."""

(Reuters) - Becoming a nurse in 2018 was a dream come true for William Coddington. 
He loved helping people and feeling needed at his West Palm Beach, Florida hospital. The 32-year-old was on the upswing of a decade-long battle with opioid addiction and other substance abuse, according to friends and family, who said he was committed to his recovery.
It all started to unravel in March, as fatally ill COVID-19 patients showed up in his intensive care unit. 
It rattled Coddington to see patients his age die, his mother Carolyn said. He could no longer attend his 12-step recovery meetings in person. He was scared about how little personal protective equipment he had. He had nightmares about alarms going off on ventilators in the ICU. 
On the night of April 24, he spoke by phone to his best friend Robert Marks and sounded distraught, Marks said. Coddington was caught between the war zone at work and his confinement at home.
“Don’t take unnecessary risks but hang in there,” Marks texted him. 
The next morning, Coddington was found dead in his car in a hotel parking lot in Deerfield Beach, Florida.
His family suspects a drug overdose. A spokeswoman for the Broward County Medical Examiner s office said the case is pending. The Broward County Sheriff s Office said it is still investigating but does not suspect foul play. 
Reuters reconstructed Coddington s last weeks through some of his text messages, Facebook  posts and interviews with his parents, brother and two close friends. Reuters could not independently verify Coddington s cause of death. 
Frontline  healthcare workers are trying to cope with the trauma of treating the novel coronavirus, which has inundated U.S. hospitals with desperately ill patients and killed more than 90,000 Americans in less than three months.
Healthcare workers with histories of substance abuse may have more difficulty coping with fear, isolation and witnessing so much death during the pandemic, psychiatrists told Reuters. Those factors could provoke relapses in workers recovering from addiction, they said.
“Patients who are being treated for opioid use disorder have reported increased stress and opioid craving since this pandemic began,"" said Kelly Dunn, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who researches opioid use. 
SCARED, BUT COMMITTED
Coddington grew up living with his mother, an executive assistant at a healthcare company, in Deerfield Beach, after his parents got divorced in 2001. 
Coddington s family said he was addicted to opioids from a young age. It started with painkillers he received after a leg surgery, Coddington told his friend Skye Alexander, whom he met in nursing school. 
Coddington entered inpatient rehabilitation at age 21, his mother said. When he emerged, he joined 12-step fellowships, self-help healing groups and therapy. 
“He was always trying different things to find the stability to interact with the world,” said Marks, a resident of Miami Beach who knew Coddington for 10 years.
When COVID-19 patients in March started arriving at JFK Medical Center s North campus, where Coddington worked for 3 months, he volunteered for the coronavirus unit. 
He did it because he was younger than some of his colleagues, and so potentially less likely to become severely ill, and because he was not a parent, said his friend Alexander.
“That was the type of person Will was,” she said.
Still, Coddington was scared, his friends said. He risked exposure and infecting his 65-year-old mother, with whom he still lived. 
Palm Beach County ranks third in Florida behind Miami-Dade and Broward counties for confirmed coronavirus cases; nearly 300 people have died of COVID-19 there. 
Coddington said in an April 13 Facebook post that his hospital had a shortage of protective equipment, especially crucial N95 respirator masks. He said he didn t blame his employer because the issue was widespread.
“In my hospital we are rationing 1 n95 mask for my whole shift,” Coddington wrote. “We are running out of gowns. We are having people make makeshift face shields that end up snapping."" 
Days before he died, his face shield fell off while he was helping with an intubation, which involves putting tubes into patients’ airways to assist breathing, said his father Ronald, a port engineer in Palm Beach.
“He literally felt things splash on his face,” Ronald recalled his son telling him. 
Kathryn Walton, a spokeswoman for JFK Medical Center, part of the hospital group HCA Healthcare , declined to comment on Coddington s death except to extend condolences to his family. She said the hospital’s goal was always to protect employees.
The hospital has “adequate supplies of PPE” and is “taking steps to conserve PPE because we do not know what our future needs will be,"" Walton said. 
She said the hospital offers mental health counseling by phone and video. Coddington’s friends and family say they don t know if he used those services.
 BRACING FOR IMPACT 
Coddington suffered from the social isolation imposed by the pandemic, his family and friends said.
He loved being around people, said Marks, who first met Coddington at a diner. Coddington’s “wacky” impersonations of TV characters endeared him to Marks right away.
“He was like a character all on his own,” Marks said. 
Coddington relied on 12-step meetings to stay sober, but after one virtual video gathering, he told his mother it was not as helpful.
“He couldn’t meet with his sponsor,” she said. “And his friends, nobody wanted to see him because he worked in a hospital, not even to sit 6 feet apart.”
In his last weeks, Coddington came home from work, spoke little and played video games in his room, Carolyn said. His impersonations - including one of her Southern accent that always made them laugh – stopped. 
His friend Alexander, of Sunrise, Florida, said she noticed the change too: ""It was despair ... creeping in.""
Coddington had relapsed before. In 2017, while on a break from nursing school, he had ended up on a ventilator, according to Alexander, who said she visited him in the hospital. She said Coddington told her he had overdosed on the club drug Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHb).
With the pandemic weighing on Coddington, his loved ones were “bracing for impact,” Marks said. Carolyn checked on him constantly. His father and friends called and texted. 
“You are so needed right now by others. You can be great,"" Ronald Coddington said to his son in text messages on April 1. “Please please bury me some day. Don’t make me bury you ... I love you.”
""I love you too,"" Coddington replied.
CRAVING RELIEF
The night of April 24, Coddington argued with his mother, who feared a relapse was coming. They made up, but he announced he was heading to a hotel for a good night s sleep.
Coddington kissed Carolyn and assured her she could track his location on her phone. He called Marks that evening, expressing how trapped he felt between the chaos at work and being cooped up at home.
“I couldn’t stop thinking about him because of how upset he sounded,” Marks said. Sleepless at 1:24 a.m., Marks sent his friend $20 on Apple  Pay to buy himself coffee before his shift.
Coddington never responded. Carolyn checked his location the morning of April 25. He wasn t at the hospital. She drove to the hotel and found him dead in his car.
Ronald Coddington said police told him they obtained a video, likely hotel security footage, showing his son sitting in his car in the parking lot that night when another car briefly pulled alongside. Ronald said there was ""some kind of exchange"" between his son and the other vehicle s driver that he suspects was a drug deal. 
The Broward County Sheriff’s office did not respond to Reuters  request for the video. 
Family members think the toxicology report, expected in a few weeks, will confirm an overdose - a temporary escape gone wrong. 

“Do I think he wanted to die that night? 100% no,” said his friend Marks. “I would bet every dollar I have that it was in an effort to have some relief.”"

In the masterplan backed by President Xi Jinping himself, China will invest an estimated $1.4 trillion over six years to 2025, calling on urban governments and private tech giants like Huawei Technologies Co. to lay fifth generation wireless networks, install cameras and sensors, and develop AI software that will underpin autonomous driving to automated factories and mass surveillance.
The new infrastructure initiative is expected to drive mainly local giants from  Alibaba   and Huawei to SenseTime Group Ltd. at the expense of U.S. companies. As tech nationalism mounts, the investment drive will reduce China’s dependence on foreign technology, echoing objectives set forth previously in the Made in China 2025 program. Such initiatives have already drawn fierce criticism from the Trump administration, resulting in moves to block the rise of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.
“Nothing like this has happened before, this is China’s gambit to win the global tech race,” said Digital China Holdings Chief Operating Officer Maria Kwok, as she sat in a Hong Kong office surrounded by facial recognition cameras and sensors. “Starting this year, we are really beginning to see the money flow through.”
The tech investment push is part of a fiscal package waiting to be signed off by China’s legislature, which convenes this week. The government is expected to announce infrastructure funding of as much as $563 billion this year, against the backdrop of the country’s worst economic performance since the Mao era.
The nation’s biggest purveyors of cloud computing and data analysis Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings  Ltd. will be linchpins of the upcoming endeavor. China has already entrusted Huawei to galvanize 5G. Tech leaders including Pony Ma and Jack Ma are espousing the program.
Maria Kwok’s company is a government-backed systems integration provider, among many that are jumping at the chance. In the southern city of Guangzhou, Digital China is bringing half a million units of project housing online, including a complex three quarters the size of Central Park. To find a home, a user just has to log on to an app, scan their face and verify their identity. Leases can be signed digitally via smartphone and the renting authority is automatically flagged if a tenant’s payment is late.
China is no stranger to far-reaching plans with massive price tags that appear to achieve little. There’s no guarantee this program will deliver the economic rejuvenation its proponents promise. Unlike previous efforts to resuscitate the economy with “dumb” bridges and highways, this newly laid digital infrastructure will help national champions develop cutting-edge technologies.
What BloombergNEF Says
China’s new stimulus plan will likely lead to a consolidation of industrial internet providers, and could lead to the emergence of some larger companies able to compete with global leaders such as GE and Siemens. One bet is on industrial internet-of-things platforms as China aims to cultivate three world leading companies in this area by 2025.

China isn’t alone in pumping money into the tech sector as a way to get out of the post-virus economic slump. Earlier this month, South Korea said AI and wireless communications would be at the core of it its “New Deal” to create jobs and boost growth.
According to the government-backed China Center for Information Industry Development, the 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) that China is estimated to spend from now until 2025 encompasses areas typically considered leading edge such as AI and IoT as well as items such as ultra-high voltage lines and high-speed rail.
Separate estimates by  Morgan Stanley   put new infrastructure at around $180 billion each year for the next 11 years -- or $1.98 trillion in total. Those calculations also include power and rail lines. That annual figure would be almost double the past three-year average, the investment bank said in a March report that listed key stock beneficiaries including companies such as China Tower Corp., Alibaba, GDS Holdings , Quanta Computer Inc. and Advantech Co.
Beijing’s half-formed vision is already stirring a plethora of stocks, a big reason why five of China’s 10 best-performing stocks this year are tech plays like networking gear maker Dawning Information Industry Co. and Apple  supplier GoerTek Inc. The bare outlines of the masterplan were enough to drive pundits toward everything from satellite operators to broadband providers.
It’s unlikely that U.S companies will benefit much from the tech-led stimulus and in some cases they stand to lose existing business. Earlier this year when the country’s largest telecom carrier China Mobile  awarded contracts for 37 billion yuan in 5G base stations, the lion’s share went to Huawei and other Chinese companies. Sweden’s Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) got only a little over 10% of the business in the first four months. In one of its projects, Digital China will help the northeastern city of Changchun swap out American cloud computing staples  IBM  , Oracle  and EMC  with home-grown technology.
It’s in data centers that a considerable chunk of the new infrastructure development will take place. Over 20 provinces have launched policies to support enterprises utilizing cloud computing services, according to a March note from UBS Group AG . Tony Yu, chief executive officer of Chinese server maker H3C, that his company was seeing a significant increase in demand for data center services from some of the country’s top internet companies. “Rapid growth in up-and-coming sectors will bring a new force to China’s economy after the pandemic passes,” he told Bloomberg News.
From there, more investment should flow. Bain Capital-backed data center operator Chindata Group estimated that for every one dollar spent on data centers another $5 to $10 in investment in related sectors would take place, including in networking, power grid and advanced equipment manufacturing. “A whole host of supply-chain companies will benefit,” the company said in a statement.
There’s concern about whether this long-term strategy provides much in the way of stimulus now, and where the money will come from. “It’s impossible to prop up China’s economy with new infrastructure alone,” said Zhu Tian, professor of economics at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “If you are worried about the government’s added debt levels and their debt servicing abilities right now, of course you wouldn’t do it. But it’s a necessary thing to do at a time of crisis.”
Digital China is confident that follow-up projects from its housing initiative in Guangzhou could generate 30 million yuan in revenue for the company. It’s also hoping to replicate those efforts with local governments in the northeastern province of Jilin, where it has 3.3 billion yuan worth of projects approved. These include building a so-called city brain that will for the first time connect databases including traffic, schools and civil matters such as marriage registry. “The concept of smart cities has been touted for years but now we are finally seeing the investment,” said Kwok."

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Authorities in 23 countries across five continents have sought access to contact tracing technology from Apple Inc  and Alphabet  Inc’s Google, the companies announced on Wednesday as they released the initial version of their system.
But authorities would have to stop requiring phone numbers from users under the companies  rules, one of several restrictions that have left governments fighting the novel coronavirus frustrated that the world s top two smartphone software makers undercut the technology s usefulness by prioritizing user privacy.
Apple and Google said several U.S. states and 22 countries have sought access to their technology, but it is unclear how many will end up publishing mobile apps that use it. 
Using apps to accelerate contact tracing, in which authorities identify and test people who were recently near a virus carrier, has emerged as a tool to stem new outbreaks. It could help authorities test more potentially infected individuals than they would normally be able to based on patients recalling recent interactions from memory. 
But some governments contend their app-based efforts would be more effective if they could track users  locations to identify hot spots for virus transmission and notify them about possible exposure through calls or texts, rather than a generic push notification.
Apple and Google have barred authorities using their technology from collecting GPS location data or requiring users to enter personal data.
""We have a collision of tech, privacy and health professionals and the Venn diagram doesn’t really have a spot where they all overlap,"" said Chester Wisniewski, a principal research scientist at cybersecurity company Sophos.
Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries that have sought to develop their own technology are experiencing glitches, draining device batteries and seeing limited adoption.
Apple and Google have said their system will more reliably use Bluetooth connections between devices to log users who are in physical proximity for at least five minutes. 
Developers of contact tracing apps for Austria, Germany and Switzerland told Reuters this week they were moving forward with the Apple-Google technology and were fine not knowing users  phone numbers.
Other governments are hedging their bets. Norway plans to compare the effectiveness of its Smittestopp app with an Apple-Google-based app, Gun Peggy Knudsen, acting deputy director of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in an interview.
Smittestopp, which has a development budget of about $5 million, accesses GPS location and requires phone numbers. But it has seen limited use because of a low number of new infections. 
""If the tracing is so much better with the Apple-Google tool, then perhaps we should switch and we would consider what we need to do to do the switch,"" Knudsen said.
North Dakota, which offered the first U.S. contact tracing app, told Reuters on Wednesday it will leave its initial Care19 app as a location-tracking ""diary"" tool to help patients jog their memories. But it also will release a new Care19 Exposure app based on the Apple-Google technology.

The Australian government said it was in talks with Apple and Google about enhancing its COVIDSafe app, which currently requires phone numbers, postcodes and age ranges."

Masaaki Taira, who heads a team set up a month ago to enlist private-sector tech companies’ help with efforts to control the virus, said the pandemic should be used as an opportunity to shift the administration into the digital world.
“The government hasn’t been able to keep pace with technological progress as it should,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “Politicians and bureaucrats didn’t have a strong enough awareness, or they may have paid too much heed to those who were wary of it.”
Local government online application systems for cash handouts have hit so many snags that some areas are advising people to save time by sending written applications. The use of name stamps known as “hanko” in office work forced some workers to keep commuting to their offices even as the infection spread, hampering efforts to contain the virus by reducing personal contacts.
This comes as neighbors such China, South Korea and Taiwan have tapped into technology in their virus battles and developed apps that aid in items ranging from minimizing person-to-person contact to making sure people can find protective masks at stores.
Japan has yet to introduce a smartphone Bluetooth app for virus contact tracing, which the government had hoped to launch in May, but it could face delays. Taira said the government was awaiting specifications from Apple Inc . and Google  and that he couldn’t say when the app would come into use.
As Japan prepares to lift a state of emergency in more areas of the country, it should look to use the crisis as a technological opportunity, Taira said.
“Japan has a history of moving its capital city in response to infectious diseases,” he said. After the coronavirus, it should move its capital into the digital world, he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A chastened Masayoshi Son summed up SoftBank Group Corp s (T:9984) record $13 billion operating loss on stage this week with a striking image: unicorns tumbling into the ""valley of the coronavirus"".
Son s presentations are more akin to the performances of Apple Inc  co-founder Steve Jobs than the data-dense displays common in corporate Japan, with slides becoming an enduring part of the chief executive s sales pitch.
While striking some observers as comical, the images, mixed with charts showing free cash flow and dividend policy, often outline central tenets of the businessman s thinking. 
Notable examples include SoftBank as a golden egg-laying goose that will reward with patience, or as tofu representing corporate wealth that the tech conglomerate will in the future churn out like a factory.
""How rare is that in a leadership communication in Japan?"" said public relations consultant Bob Pickard, who advises CEOs. Such images play a major role in driving news coverage and chatter on social media, he said.
Son has recently returned to Twitter, tweeting this week, ""the reason for failure lies not externally but within yourself"". But presentations remain the primary method for publicly advancing his ideas, with slides including soaring multi-coloured unicorns representing billion-dollar startups.
To convey his technological utopian vision he uses not only slides but slogans in the simple English favoured by Japanese companies targeting their domestic base. SoftBank looks beyond merely maximising shareholder returns with its corporate philosophy of ""information revolution - happiness for everyone"".
However, his optimism is meeting brute reality as the coronavirus crashes the global economy and hammers Son s investments. 
Son relies on a simple narrative couched with ample small print legalese, said Pickard, with this week s argument that ""winged unicorns"" will escape the ""valley of the coronavirus"".

""He runs the risk of not being taken seriously and becoming a caricature,"" Pickard said."

The regulator acted after Thomas Le Bonniec, a former Apple contractor, wrote to European data protection regulators on May 20 to push for investigations into these practices.
""The DPC engaged with Apple on this issue when it first arose last summer and Apple has since made some changes,"" Graham  Doyle, Deputy Commissioner at the Irish DPC, said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
""However, we have followed up again with Apple following the release of this public statement and await responses,"" he said, in reference to the letter. ""In addition, it should be noted that the European Data Protection Board is working on the production of guidance in the area of voice assistant technologies.""
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Apple said last year it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors.
Le Bonniec s letter, seen by Reuters, which was published on Thursday, said in reference to EU data protection laws: ""Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.""

Le Bonniec worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Irish offices, he said in the letter."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The latest U.S. government action against China s Huawei takes direct aim at the company s HiSilicon chip division--a business that in a few short years has become central to China s ambitions in semiconductor technology but will now lose access to tools that are central to its success.
That could make it the most damaging U.S. attack yet against a Chinese company that U.S. officials told reporters Wednesday functioned as a ""tool of strategic influence"" for the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for its part denounced the U.S. allegations and called the new measures ""arbitrary and pernicious.""
Established in 2004, HiSilicon develops chips mostly for Huawei, and for most of its existence has been an afterthought in a global chip business dominated by U.S., Korean and Japanese companies. Like most electronics firms, Huawei relied on others for the chips that powered its equipment.
But heavy investment in research and development helped drive rapid progress at HiSilicon, and in recent years the 7,000-employee unit has been central to Huawei s rise as a dominant player in the global smartphone business and the emerging 5G telecom networking business. 
HiSilicon s Kirin smartphone processor is now considered to be on par with those created by Apple Inc  and  Qualcomm Inc   --a rare example of an advanced Chinese semiconductor product that competes globally.
HiSilicon is also central to Huawei s leadership in 5G, stepping into the breach when the United States cut off access to some U.S. chips last year.
In March, Huawei revealed that 8% of the 50,000 5G base stations it sold in 2019 came with no U.S. technology, using HiSilicon chipsets instead.
But the U.S. export control rule, first reported by Reuters last week, aims to block HiSilicon s access to two crucial tools: chip design software from U.S. firms including Cadence Design Systems Inc  and  Synopsys Inc  , and the manufacturing prowess of ""foundries,"" led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), that build chips for many of the world s top semiconductor firms.
With the new restrictions,HiSilicon ""will be in a situation where they’re not able to manufacture chips at all, or if they do, then they’re not leading edge anymore,"" says Stewart Randall, who tracks China s chip industry at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink.
Without its own processors, Huawei will lose its edge over domestic smartphone rivals, analysts said. International sales had already been gutted by a ban on the use of key Google  software.
Industry sources say Huawei has stockpiled chips, and the new U.S. rule will not go into full force for 120 days. U.S. officials also note that licenses could be granted for some technologies. HiSilicon can also keep using design software it has already acquired.
HILSILICON IN TOUGH SPOT
Still, analysts agree HiSilicon is in a tough spot. Nearly all chip factories globally -- including China s leading foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981) -- buy gear from the same equipment makers, led by U.S. firms Applied Materials Inc ,  Lam Research Corp   and KLA Corp .
The new U.S. rule requires licenses for companies using U.S. machinery to build Huawei-designed chips and delivered to the Chinese firm. To be sure, the new rule will not catch items shipped to a third party, allowing HiSilicon s fabricators like TSMC the ability to ship chips to HiSilicon’s device manufacturers who can send them directly to a customer.
While there are alternatives to American machines - Japan s Tokyo Electron Ltd (T:8035), for example, makes gear that competes with Applied Materials - replacing U.S. technology is not as simple as swapping out a machine. 
“You almost have to think about it like a heart transplant,"" said VLSI Research Chief Executive Dan Hutcheson, noting that chip production lines are finely calibrated systems where everything has to work well together.
Doug Fuller of the Chinese University of Hong Kong said Huawei had a few options. It could slip around the rule by having suppliers ship directly to Huawei customers, though the U.S. officials said they would be vigilant about such workarounds.
Huawei and the Chinese government could re-double efforts to build production capabilities that did not require U.S. tools, by investing in nascent Chinese competitors and buying from Japanese and Korean firms, even if that required quality sacrifices.
Or Huawei could turn away from HiSilicon and revert to buying from overseas suppliers -- just not American ones. ""There’s talk of Huawei just turning to Samsung (KS:005930) processors,"" for its smartphone, said Fuller.

By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The University of Alabama System will require students and staff returning to its three campuses in the coming months to submit online health checks regularly and encourage them to download its contact tracing app, officials told Reuters on Thursday.
Researchers at several dozen U.S. universities are developing mobile apps that aim to curb new infections of the novel coronavirus, but Alabama is one of the first U.S. school systems to move forward on deploying such an app.
Students and employees will be reminded to sign into a website with their school login credentials every three days and report whether they have any symptoms related to COVID-19, the sometimes deadly respiratory illness caused by the virus. 
Those reluctant to fill it out may be asked to stay away from campus, but an official enforcement system has not been finalized, said Selwyn Vickers, dean of University of Alabama at Birmingham s (UAB) school of medicine.
The contact tracing mobile app, which is being built by Birmingham-based software developer MotionMobs, will use programming code released on Wednesday by Apple Inc  and Alphabet  Inc s Google that notifies people who were near users reporting as virus-positive. Users can remain anonymous the entire time.
Its use will not be required because some phones cannot operate the app, and Apple and Google also set rules preventing institutions and the state from making it mandatory, said Sue Feldman, director of graduate programs in health informatics at UAB.
But the app will be open to anyone in Alabama, she said, and some Birmingham-based companies such as Altec Inc and Regions Bank are considering telling employees to use the contact tracing and health assessment tools.
""We are encouraged by the progress being made and look forward to learning more about the contact tracing system under development,"" said Regions Bank spokeswoman Evelyn Mitchell."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will ramp up COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as it gradually lifts restrictions and is working closely with Apple Inc  and Alphabet  Inc s Google on a mobile phone app to help, the prime minister said on Friday.
In his daily news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government was already helping Ontario, the most populous province, with contact tracing and was open to do the same for the other 12 provinces and territories.
Businesses and citizens ""need to know that we have a coordinated approach to gradually reopen that is rooted in science, evidence and the ability to rapidly detect and control any future outbreaks,"" Trudeau said.
The western province of Alberta said on Friday it would test anyone in long-term care facilities, where most of the deaths have been recorded, even if they have no symptoms.
Canada s total cases rose to 81,765 on Friday, and deaths were up less than 2% to 6,180, official data showed. 
With contagion slowing, provinces have been gradually reopening in recent weeks. 
On Friday, Quebec said museums, libraries and drive-in movie theaters can open from May 29. In Calgary, the biggest city in Alberta, barber shops and hairstylists can restart from May 25, and restaurants and bars will be able to offer table service at half capacity.
On May 1, Alberta rolled out a digital-tracing tool to monitor outbreaks.
The apps are meant to help trace and call people who have come into contact with an individual infected with COVID-19.
Trudeau had not promoted the use of a tracing app, but on Friday he said the government was working ""closely"" with Apple and Google and would ""strongly recommend"" one as soon as their tracing technology is ready.

Early success of tracing apps in countries like Singapore and Australia has been patchy because Apple s iPhone does not support their approach to using Bluetooth short-range radio as a proxy for measuring the risk of infection.
Latvia s Apturi Covid (Stop Covid) app is, by contrast, based on technology launched last week by Apple and Google, whose iOS and Android operating systems run 99% of the world s smartphones.
""The developers believe that reliance on this standard will ensure widespread adoption and also compatibility over time with contact tracing apps around the world that are also expected to adopt the same exposure notification framework,"" the app s developers said in a statement.
The app would only work within the Baltic nation of nearly 2 million people at first.
But its approach aligns Latvia with a loose coalition of European countries - including Germany, Switzerland and Estonia - that are working to make it possible for their national apps to  talk  to each other across borders.

Like mobile roaming, such interoperability would enable an app to work when a user travels abroad, giving governments greater confidence to ease travel restrictions without triggering a second wave of the pandemic."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Japan s Marvelous Inc on Tuesday closed up 17% at their daily limit of 682 yen after the games maker announced China s Tencent Holdings  Ltd would take a 20% stake. 
Tencent will spend around 7 billion yen ($65 million) acquiring shares from Marvelous and its largest shareholders, Amuse Capital and its chief executive, Hayao Nakayama, a former Sega executive whose son founded Marvelous. It will pay 576 yen each - 1% below Monday s undisturbed closing price.

The investment is the latest example of an influx of Chinese money and gaming content into Japan, where a largely unconsolidated industry underpinning the country s pop culture is having to compete with well-resourced overseas rivals.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  plans to reopen about 100 U.S. stores, mostly with curbside pickup but some with walk-in service, the company said on Tuesday.
Apple shuttered stores worldwide as the novel coronavirus pandemic spread but has slowly opened them based on local health data. Earlier this month, the company reopened a handful of stores in Alaska, Idaho and Alabama.
Under Apple s new procedures, stores with walk-in service will require customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering. Apple will provide masks to customers who have none. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of people in the store at one time, which Apple said could create delays for walk-in customers.
Apple plans to allow customers to handle display products, as before.
""Throughout the day, we re conducting enhanced deep cleanings that place special emphasis on all surfaces, display products, and highly trafficked areas,"" Apple retail chief Deirdre O Brien wrote in a letter to customers.
Apple has stores in several states where local rules would have allowed it to open, but it did not immediately do so. The company has relied on local data down to the city level, sometimes even reopening in the same U.S. state at different times.

The company started shuttering its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. Days later, Apple closed all stores outside mainland China as the virus moved around the globe. Stores reopened outside the Greater China region in mid-April, starting in South Korea, and have continued through Europe, Asia and the United States."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Unthinkable just two months ago as the world economy shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. stock benchmark S&P 500 index broke through the psychologically-important 3,000 level on Tuesday, capping a 37% stock rally since its March low. 
But the market may be priced for an economic recovery that the data so far does not support, and some participants say the rally has gone too far, too fast.
It has been fueled by extraordinary interventions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, a $2 trillion stimulus passed by Congress, and hopes that the rapid development of a vaccine will mean that the worst of the damage from the global economic freeze has passed. 
""People have been locked up and when they see sparkles of hope like vaccines, that drives optimism probably ahead of where it should be and clearly ahead of the economy,"" said Richard Steinberg, chief market strategist at the Colony Group. 
Analysts cautioned that they do not expect the market to continue its rapid path upward. 
""I think we re going to give back a little bit soon as more political headlines emerge and people start thinking about problems with China, problems in Europe, problems everywhere the investor looks,"" said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Chief Executive Christian Sewing said on Tuesday that markets were too optimistic.
""In my personal view, the underlying assumption for this recovery are a bit too optimistic,"" he said. ""Second- and third- order effects have not been fully priced in at this stage.""
The market spike has come against a devastating economic backdrop. The U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the most since the Great Depression. [nL1N2CP2KQ]
“It is pretty extraordinary,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ""It is a  V  market with probably not a  V  economic condition,"" he said, referring to the shape of the possible recovery.
Any developments that bring a vaccine closer to market will likely fuel additional gains even if economic data lag, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. 
""If things go well, we could have a vaccine by the first of the year,"" Cardillo said. ""It s a rally of hope."" 
BULLISH HERD 
It is being partly driven by five giants - Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Inc , Apple Inc ,  Facebook Inc  , and Google-parent Alphabet Inc  - make up approximately 20% of the weight of the S&P 500 index, pushing the broad market up as investors herd into companies that have seen increased demand during the economic freeze. 
Amazon, for instance, is up nearly 45% since its March low, while Facebook is up 62%. 
Some justify the gains by comparing the U.S. economy to China, which is about two months ahead in terms of both the virus outbreak and recovery. 
China s composite purchasing managers index fell by more than half in January, yet by April was above its reading at the beginning of the year. U.S. Composite PMI, meanwhile, began its steep drop in February and posted a nearly 35% gain in May, according to flash figures from Markit.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Tuesday it was making public the source code of its coronavirus contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu for Google s  Android smartphones, a move digital rights activists said will boost the security of users.
The bulk of India s roughly 500 million smartphone users have Android devices and the source code for the app s iOS version will be released in the next two weeks, India s tech ministry said in a statement.
""Transparency, privacy and security have been the core design principles of Aarogya Setu since its inception. And opening the source code up to the developer community signifies the government of India s continuing commitment to these principles,"" Amitabh Kant, CEO of the government think-tank NITI Aayog, told a news conference.
Aarogya Setu ( Health Bridge ) was launched by the government in early April as a key tool in containing the spread of COVID-19. It is currently used by over 115 million Indians.
It uses Bluetooth and GPS on smartphones to record when people come in close contact with one another, so that contacts can be quickly alerted when a person is diagnosed with COVID-19.
Privacy advocates including a French hacker who called out some of Aarogya Setu s flaws on Twitter  had asked the government to make the app s source code public, which would allow security researchers to inspect the system and find how it captures data.
A source code refers to programming instructions which are used to run an application.
Udbhav Tiwari, the public policy adviser for internet firm Mozilla, said the Aarogya Setu app still had some ground to cover before it could claim to be truly open source.
""This includes open sourcing the server-side code and ensuring that the app is built exclusively from its public repository,"" Tiwari said. On Tuesday, the government said it did plan to release the server code.
India has been encouraging a widespread use of the app including for rail and air travel, although it softened its previous demand for compulsory use by office workers, after a backlash from privacy advocates.
The app, which was initially available for only Android smartphones and Apple  devices, can now also be used in cheap internet-enabled phones which run on the KaiOS mobile operating system."

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese man suspected of killing 36 people and injuring dozens in an arson attack at an animation studio last July was arrested on Wednesday after spending 10 months in hospital for treatment.
Police had issued an arrest warrant for Shinji Aoba at the time of the fire but had been unable to question him after he suffered serious burns in the blaze at Kyoto Animation. 
Aoba, 42, was arrested at a Kyoto hospital and transferred to police headquarters for further questioning, police said in a statement. Aoba s injuries had left him unable to walk on his own, a police official said.
The fire - one of Japan s deadliest in decades - killed mostly young artists at the studio, shocking animation fans globally and prompting tributes from leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Apple  s chief executive, Tim Cook.
Police said in a statement that Aoba allegedly went to the studio, poured gasoline inside the building and set it ablaze, killing 22 women and 14 men inside. He was also suspected of the attempted murder of another 34 people.
Media reports at the time said Aoba told police he had taken the action because the studio had plagiarized his novel.
In a statement, Kyoto Animation said it expected the suspect to be prosecuted ""to the maximum extent"" under the law.
""We have no further words for the suspect... Our fallen colleagues will never return, and our wounds will never heal,"" it said.

Kyoto Animation is well known in Japan and abroad for its series and movies, including ""Violet Evergarden"", which has been on Netflix ."

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to regulate or shut down social media companies, a day after  Twitter Inc   for the first time added a fact-checking label to some of his tweets about mail-in ballots.
The regulation of big technology companies including  Facebook Inc   and Alphabet  Inc s Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.
Here is a look at the stances of Republican President Trump and his likely Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, on some key tech policy issues:
BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly administration of President Barack Obama, has criticized Facebook and other tech giants during his campaign and proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc .
Trump, who has mixed relationships with tech companies, regularly bashing Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, but meeting with Apple Inc  s Tim Cook, has said ""there is something going on in terms of monopoly"" when asked about big tech firms. 
The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies, but both he and Biden have stopped short of calling for the firms to be broken up. 
Biden has said dismantling companies like Facebook was ""something we should take a really hard look at.""
REGULATING SOCIAL MEDIA
Both Biden and Trump have blasted social media companies over their handling of political content. Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused the companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives. 
On Wednesday, following Twitter s fact-check, the president tweeted: ""Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.""
Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its policies on political ads and manipulated videos, was the only Democratic presidential candidate who called for revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a key internet law that largely exempts online platforms from legal liability for users  posts.
In 2018, Trump signed into law a bill that makes websites liable for third-party content that facilitates prostitution or sex trafficking. But this year, in a win for tech firms, Trump also signed a trade deal that means tech companies will have U.S.-style liability protections for online content when operating in Mexico and Canada.
DATA PRIVACY
Congress has been trying to build consensus on a federal consumer privacy legislation, which the Trump administration has signaled support for. Biden has said the U.S. should set privacy ""standards not unlike the Europeans,"" an apparent reference to the European Union s stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The Trump administration has criticized Silicon Valley over the issue of encryption, blasting Apple for what he called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals. 
Privacy advocates have also slammed the Trump administration for actions they say violate immigrants  privacy and for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of their data.
DIGITAL DIVIDE
The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband.
Trump has said he is committed to ensuring ""every citizen can have high-speed internet access,"" though Democratic rivals criticized him over the continuing digital divide on the campaign trail. In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund. 

Biden also said he plans a $20 billion investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans."

(Reuters) - AT&T’s WarnerMedia division launches its HBO Max streaming service on Wednesday, taking on Netflix, Disney and Amazon at a time when coronavirus lockdowns have boosted demand for streaming even as rising unemployment has cut disposable incomes.
HBO Max launches to a captive audience stuck at home without access to theater, live music, shopping excursions or live or televised sporting events. That situation helped Netflix Inc  sign up 15.8 million new paying customers in the first three months of the year, more than double what it expected to attract.
But with film and TV productions halted across the globe, HBO Max has postponed dozens of releases - most notably a “Friends” reunion special originally planned for launch. If HBO Max does not resume production by this fall, the service could start to see a shortage of original content as early as January, according to a source familiar with the company. 
At $15 per month, the service is more expensive than both the $7 per month Disney+ streaming service and the $13 per month standard Netflix plan. Still, WarnerMedia hopes to reach about 80 million global HBO Max subscribers by 2025. 
Many existing HBO subscribers in the United States will not need to do anything to get the new service, as WarnerMedia revised deals with distributors including Apple Inc ,  Charter Communications  Inc , Hulu and most recently, Comcast Corp .
But subscribers of HBO through Amazon.com Inc  and  Roku   Inc are out of luck as WarnerMedia has yet to strike new agreements. 
For these and new customers, WarnerMedia is offering a promotion for subscribing directly with the company: $3 off the regular $15 price. Some AT&T customers will also get it at no additional cost. 
HBO Max will feature 10,000 hours of content from WarnerMedia brands and libraries such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Cartoon Network. At launch it will include sixoriginal titles, including “Love Life,” a romantic comedy anthology series featuring Anna Kendrick, and a Sesame Workshop children s show ""The Not Too Late Show with Elmo."" 

More original programming will come over time, including the DC Comics film “Justice League,” recut by director Zack Snyder."

Investing.com - Wall Street clawed back losses on Wednesday as a surge in financials and industrials offset a fall in large-cap tech stocks and ongoing worries about escalating U.S.-China tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.36%, or 340 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.86%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.30%.
The rotation from growth to value continued on Wednesday, with financials leading the way, powered by bank stocks as reopening optimism has stoked hopes of a quicker economic recovery.
JPMorgan Chase  rose about 4%, Goldman Sachs  was up more than 5% and  Citigroup   jumped 7%.
The optimism over the reopening of economies has coincided with growing hopes that a vaccine can be found sooner rather than later, with some, including President Donald Trump, touting year-end as a possible target.
Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, however, said a publically availability vaccine is unlikely to arrive before 2021. Industrials also caught a bid on the back of a sharp uptick in  General Electric   after the conglomerate said it would be selling its lighting division as part of ongoing restructuring efforts.
But technology lagged the rally, with investors seemingly wary of the frothy valuations on display following the sector s melt-up since the lows seen in March.
Facebook , Apple , Amazon.com , Netflix  and Google-parent Alphabet  traded below the flatline, though were well off their session lows."

Investing.com – The Dow surged on Wednesday, as technology stocks fought back from session lows and bank stocks continued to extend gains, overshadowing concerns over U.S.-China tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.21%, or 553 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.48%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.77%.
Tech stocks, which have led the rally from the lows seen in March, pared losses to end the day positive, with FAANG names rebounding from intraday lows.
Facebook , Amazon.com  and Google-parent Alphabet  ended the day just below the flatline, while Netflix  and Apple  ended up on the day.
Elsewhere in tech, Twitter  fell 3% as President Donald Trump threatened action against the social media company for starting fact check his tweets.
Bank stocks, meanwhile, continued their bold start to the week as reopening optimism has stoked hopes of a quicker economic recovery.
JPMorgan Chase  rose about 5.8%, Goldman Sachs  was up 6.90% and  Citigroup   jumped 8.5%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on social media companies on Thursday, White House officials said after Trump threatened to shut down the platform he accused of stifling conservative voices.
The officials, who spoke to reporters traveling with Trump to Washington from Florida aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, gave no further details. 
Before leaving for Florida earlier in the day to observe a space launch that was postponed because of bad weather, Trump again accused  Twitter Inc   and other social media of bias without offering evidence.
It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down social media companies. 
The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits any action Trump could take to regulate such platforms.
Twitter declined comment on news of Trump s plans. Facebook  and Google  did not immediately comment.
Separately, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Wednesday upheld the dismissal of a suit brought by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple  alleging they conspired to suppress conservative political views. 
Trump s latest dispute with social media emerged after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time attached a warning to some of his tweets prompting readers to fact check the president s claims.
In the tweets tagged by Twitter, Trump made unsubstantiated claims about mail-in voting. Trump falsely claims that mail-in ballots lead to vote fraud and ineligible voters getting ballots. 
""Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,"" Trump said in a pair of additional posts on Twitter on Wednesday.
The president, a heavy user of Twitter with more than 80 million followers, added: ""Clean up your act, NOW!!!!""
STRONGEST THREAT YET
Trump s threat to shut down platforms like Twitter and Facebook is his strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. Shares of both companies fell on Wednesday. 
Last year the White House circulated drafts of a proposed executive order about anti-conservative bias which never gained traction. 
The Internet Association, which includes Twitter and Facebook among its members, said online platforms do not have a political bias and they offer ""more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history.""
Asked during Twitter s annual meeting on Wednesday why the company decided to affix the label to Trump s mail-in ballot tweets, General Counsel Sean Edgett said decisions about handling misinformation are made as a group.
""We have a group and committee of folks who take a look at these things and make decisions on what s getting a lot of visibility and traction...,"" he said.
In recent years Twitter has tightened its policies amid criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.
Tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon  face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a U.S. congressional panel. 
Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with the U.S. Justice Department, have been considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post. Such changes could expose tech companies to more lawsuits. 
Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of Big Tech companies, sent a letter to Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Wednesday asking why the company should continue to receive legal immunity after ""choosing to editorialize on President Trump s tweets.""

Twitter s rival Facebook left Trump s post on mail-in ballots on Tuesday untouched."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Alibaba   Group Holding Ltd is emerging as one of China s biggest corporate winners of the coronavirus crisis, gaining the opportunity to expand its businesses and solidify its status as a critical part of the country s socio-economic engine.
While many companies are hurting from disruption caused by the virus, Alibaba has seen traffic at its online marketplaces shoot higher and demand grow for services like food delivery. Local authorities have even turned to its cloud business to build health-tracking apps.
The company, which emerged as China s leading e-commerce company after the 2003 SARS outbreak, is now positioning itself as a hirer and a lender too, advertising for over 100,000 jobs and offering billions of dollars in loans to small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) at a time when many others are retrenching.
Such moves have further embedded the firm in the lives of consumers, arguably more so than rivals like Tencent Holdings  Ltd or JD .com Inc, which are trying similar initiatives but have narrower offerings. 
""That s a classic gangster strategy: When the market pulls back, one company doubles down, and then when it returns, you have the whole market,"" said Jeff Towson, a professor of investment formerly at Peking University.
""It s something I haven t seen ... any other company do at that scale,"" he said of Alibaba s plan, announced in March, to lend $282 billion to SMEs in 2020. 
It is pattern being repeated in the United States, where technology giants Amazon.com Inc  and  Microsoft Corp   have been able to weather the coronavirus storm better than smaller peers and concurrently reinforce their position, not only in the market but in the fabric of society itself.
But that also signals that big tech companies like Alibaba are only going to get bigger, potentially stifling smaller firms, analysts said.
To be sure, it is not all good news for Alibaba. E-commerce growth is slowing overall, with the company posting a loss of $1.09 billion on the value of outside investments in its most recent quarter during which the virus impact was most acute.
Still, online merchants said Alibaba was able to use the crisis to pull further ahead of newer rivals like  Pinduoduo   Inc, building on earlier moves to promote services like livestreaming which soared in popularity with both users and merchants due to travel curbs.
Alibaba on Friday reported increases of 21% in quarterly revenue and 19% in core commerce sales, beating expectations. Its executives had predicted in February that the virus would cause sales to drop.
""After the virus, there s nowhere for offline vendors to go but online,"" said Josh Gardner, who operates online store fronts for overseas brands at Kung Fu Data. ""Alibaba has a dominant position on JD.com except for a few electronics categories, and Pinduoduo is mainly for low-margin goods.""
Pacific Epoch analyst Steven Zhu said Alibaba s food delivery arm Ele.me was able to catch up with dominant peer Meituan Dianping  during the virus, mainly by offering discounts which both had previously pulled back on. 
Ele.me s daily active users rose to roughly 15 million from 10 million, while Meituan s increased to 17 million from 15 million, showed data from researcher Analysys. 
The company has also beefed up through laid off restaurant and retail workers. Its Kaola imported-product platform, supermarket arm Hema and Ele.me together said they have hired, or are hiring for, as many as 140,000 roles. 
Gao Daoxiang, 20, told Reuters he joined Ele.me as a driver in April when the hotpot restaurant he had worked for did not reopen after restrictions were lifted.
""I know a lot of people who can t find work,"" he said, ""So their friends are introducing them to these apps.""
The virus has also been a shot in the arm for emerging business lines outside of e-commerce such as cloud-computing, where revenue grew 58% in January-March.
Its workplace messaging app Dingtalk saw downloads through Apple  s App Store increase over 1,000% in February as work and schooling shifted to home computers, showed data from SensorTower. It is now a leader in a category vied for by social media leaders Tencent and ByteDance.
Analysts said the virus and Alibaba s strengthening position were likely to reinforce trends that worry some in China and elsewhere.
Ele.me, for example, is accelerating the rise of the gig economy, which often provides less stable employment. DingTalk is ushering in the age of remote work, and has raised hackles among some users for enabling employers to closely monitor worker activity.
Katt Gu, who tracks China s internet sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Sujitech, said the trend could make it even harder for smaller startups to compete in a landscape dominated by a few giants.

""All of those companies, when they get a little big and get noticed by Alibaba, they just get bought - so they never get a chance to become big companies,"" she said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Lockdown bans on live performances have left many British musicians on the breadline, fuelling a campaign for them to get a bigger share of the profits from streaming their songs online.
""I m getting contacted by lots of young artists who have millions of streams from 200,000 monthly listeners and don t make the minimum wage,"" musician Tom Gray from English indie band Gomez told Reuters.
Gray has founded the Broken Record campaign to pressure the industry into doing more for the people who make the music.
While platinum-selling Gomez has racked up millions of plays on Spotify , the market-leading online music platform, this amounts to ""a few pennies"" of income for Gray.
That is because the money paid by consumers for major online music platforms goes into a central pot that is distributed to artists according to market share.
So if someone pays 10 pounds ($12) a month and listened only to Gomez, their money would still find its way to the world s top artists and their record labels.
The streaming companies say they are doing their utmost to help artists during the lockdown. Spotify has pledged to match donations to music charities up to a total of $10 million and Apple  Music launched a $50 million fund for independent record labels and distributors. 
The Help Musicians UK charity has paid 8.5 million pounds to 17,500 musicians who have run out of money for essentials.
But many more musicians are struggling, shut out of state lockdown support programmes because their incomes are irregular. A Musicians Union survey earlier this month found 38% were not eligible for government help.
""I know how hard this is already for so many people and I can see how truly terrifyingly bad it s going to get,"" said Gray, whose campaign is backed by Boy George, John Grant, and the Shins.
Hot Chip, a popular electro-tinged indie band, had planned a global tour through 2020. Now, the musicians and their nine-strong crew have lost much of their income, despite millions listening to their music online every month - a fanbase that might have earned Hot Chip a ""bed of gold"" decades ago.
""We ourselves don t know where the next chunk of cash is really coming from,"" said Al Doyle, a member of Hot Chip.
Despite a likely 25% drop in global music revenues this year because of the pandemic, the industry is set to double in value by 2030, a Goldman Sachs  research note published this month showed. But many artists have doubts about their future.
""If coronavirus continues like this for the whole of the summer, then really that s going to feel like my life in music has been decimated,"" said Theo Bard, a songwriter who was hoping to promote an album set for release this summer.
Doyle from Hot Chip conceded that only consumers might have the power to redress the balance, by buying music directly from their favourite artists s websites or via online platforms such as Bandcamp where the artists control the prices.
""If it s unsuccessful, then I think you ll find lots of mid-level artists, probably kind of on our level, deciding that this is not a feasible way to support ourselves.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. central bank now has a stake in the fortunes of a broad swath of corporate America after buying about $1.3 billion of bond funds with debt issued by firms in all walks of the world s biggest economy, from Apple Inc  to a clutch of companies in bankruptcy.
The details on holdings in the Fed s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, one of nearly a dozen emergency programs the Fed has rolled out since March to respond to the coronavirus crisis, were published Friday.
The Fed s largest investment-grade fund holding - iShares iBoxx US Dollar Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF  - contains 30 Apple bonds giving the Fed about $5.7 million of exposure to the maker of iPhones through that ETF alone as of May 19. Apple is also a holding in other ETFs the Fed bought.
The largest of the facility s junk bond fund holdings - iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF  - gives the Fed around $25,000 of exposure to three companies that have filed for bankruptcy since the health crisis erupted, including $14,000 to car rental company Hertz, $10,000 to retailer JC Penney , and $1,500 to department store operator Neiman Marcus.
All told the Fed made 158 purchases of shares in 15 exchange-traded funds from May 12 and May 18, the data showed.
Until the health crisis, the Fed had bought U.S. Treasuries and government-backed bonds. The SMCCF s purchases of bond ETFs represent entirely new territory.
LQD, the third largest U.S. taxable bond ETF, holds bonds from such banks as Bank of America Corp  and  Wells Fargo  & Co , as well as telecom operators AT&T Inc  and  Verizon Communications  Inc . The fund was the Fed facility s largest holding, at $326.3 million.
The SMCCF also bought shares in six of the seven largest ETFs devoted to high-yield - or junk - bonds, accounting for $223.4 million, of 17% of its overall portfolio.
The Fed s investment in HYG was just over $100 million."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Target  Corp  and Walmart  said on Sunday they shuttered stores across the United States as retailers already reeling from closures because of the coronavirus pandemic shut outlets amid protests that included looting in many U.S. cities. 
Protests turned violent in places including New York and Chicago following the death in Minneapolis of a black man, George Floyd, seen on video gasping for breath as a white police officer knelt on his neck.
In Los Angeles, protests led to the looting of the Alexander McQueen clothing store on Rodeo Drive, and a Gucci store on the vaunted strip was marked with the graffiti slogan: ""Eat the rich,"" according to local media reports. 
In the nearby Grove Shopping Center, which houses 51 upscale stores, Nordstrom, Ray Ban and Apple were broken into.  Nordstrom Inc   temporarily closed all its stores on Sunday, it told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""We hope to reopen our doors as soon as possible,"" the statement said. ""We had impacts at some of them and are in the process of assessing any damage so we can resume serving customers.""
Apple Inc  said in an email statement it also had decided to keep a number of its U.S. stores closed on Sunday. The company did not specify how many stores were closed, or if the closures would be extended. 
The violence was widespread, and Minnesota-based Target said it was closing or limiting hours at more than 200 stores. It did not specify how long the closures would last.
The company told Reuters it was beginning to board up its Lake Street store in Minneapolis, near where Floyd was killed, for safety and to begin recovery efforts. The company said in a statement that it would plan to reopen the store late this year. 
""There is certainly potential for the resulting social unrest to hurt certain businesses like retailers and restaurants, and for it to further dent consumer and business sentiment,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling. ""It is even possible, particularly if the unrest continues and spreads, that it would, all other things being equal, have a significant impact on investor psychology and the markets.""  
Walmart closed some stores in Minneapolis and Atlanta after protests Friday, and closed several hundred stores at 5 p.m. on Sunday, a spokesman said. ""We’ll look at them each day, and at how each community is impacted and make decisions then,"" the spokesman said.
Online retailer Amazon  said it was monitoring the situation closely. ""In a handful of cities we’ve adjusted routes or scaled back typical delivery operations to ensure the safety of our teams,"" the company said in an emailed statement. 

U.S. retail sales have posted record declines as the novel coronavirus pandemic kept Americans at home, putting the economy on track for its biggest contraction in the second quarter since the Great Depression in the 1930s."

(Reuters) - The regulation of big technology companies including  Facebook Inc   and Alphabet  Inc s Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.
Here is a look at the stances of Republican President Trump and his likely Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, on some key tech policy issues:
BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly administration of President Barack Obama, has criticized Facebook and other tech giants during his campaign and proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc .
Trump, who has mixed relationships with tech companies, regularly bashing Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, but meeting with Apple Inc  s Tim Cook, has said ""there is something going on in terms of monopoly"" when asked about big tech firms. 
The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies, but both he and Biden have stopped short of calling for the companies to be broken up. 
Biden has said dismantling companies like Facebook was ""something we should take a really hard look at.""
REGULATING SOCIAL MEDIA
Both Biden and Trump have blasted social media companies over their handling of political content. Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused the companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives. 
After  Twitter Inc   put fact-checking labels on two of Trump s tweets for the first time in May, the president said he would introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post.
The proposed legislation was part of an executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. The order also said federal spending on online advertising will be reviewed by U.S. government agencies to ensure there are no speech restrictions by a company.
Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its policies on political ads and manipulated videos, was the only Democratic presidential candidate who called for revoking Section 230.
DATA PRIVACY
Congress has been trying to build consensus on a federal consumer privacy legislation, which the Trump administration has signaled support for. Biden has said the United States should set privacy ""standards not unlike the Europeans,"" an apparent reference to the European Union s stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The Trump administration has criticized Silicon Valley over the issue of encryption, blasting Apple for what the president called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals. 
Privacy advocates have also slammed the Trump administration for actions they say violate immigrants  privacy and for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of their data.
DIGITAL DIVIDE
The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband.
Trump has said he is committed to ensuring ""every citizen can have high-speed internet access,"" though Democratic rivals criticized him over the continuing digital divide on the campaign trail. In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund. 

Biden said he also plans a $20 billion investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has little choice but to stick with his Phase 1 China trade deal for now despite his anger at Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, new Hong Kong security rules, and dwindling hopes China can meet U.S. goods purchase targets, people familiar with his administration s deliberations say. 
The U.S.-China trade negotiations took more than two years, heaped tariffs on $370 billion of Chinese products, whipsawed financial markets and dimmed global growth prospects well before the coronavirus outbreak crushed them.
In recent weeks, suggestions that Trump may cancel the deal have emanated from the White House almost daily, and businesses, investors, and China trade watchers are hanging onto every word and tweet.
But on Friday, when Trump said the United States would start dismantling trade and travel privileges for Hong Kong, he did not mention the deal. Stock markets heaved a sigh of relief, with the S&P 500 reversing losses. 
Talking tough on China and criticizing the Obama administration s more measured approach is a key part of Trump s re-election strategy. Sticking with the pact may mean accepting that China is likely to fall short of purchase commitments for U.S. agricultural goods, manufactured products, energy and services - goals that many said were unrealistic https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/china-to-ramp-up-u-s-buys-under-trade-deal-but-skeptics-question-targets-idUSKBN1ZD0FN even before the pandemic.
In response to Trump s Hong Kong announcement, China told state-owned firms to suspend large-scale farm purchases including soybeans and pork, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Such a halt will put China further behind in making good on its pledges to boost U.S. purchases by $200 billion over two years. 
But canceling the deal would reignite the nearly two-year U.S.-China trade war at a time U.S. unemployment is at its worst since the 1930s Great Depression.
The next U.S. step would likely be reviving previously planned but canceled tariffs on some $165 billion worth of Chinese consumer goods, including Apple Inc  cellphones and computers, toys and clothing - all ultimately paid by U.S. companies and passed on to consumers. Beijing would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods, fueling more market turmoil and delaying recovery.
""He s stuck with a lemon. He gets an empty agreement if he sticks with it, and he gets more actions that create an economic drag and more volatility if he abandons it,"" said one person briefed on the administration s trade deliberations.
U.S. goods exports https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html to China in the first quarter were down $4 billion from the trade war-damaged levels a year earlier, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimates https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods that during the first quarter, China made only about 40% of the purchases it needed to stay on target for a first-year increase of $77 billion over 2017 levels, implying an extremely steep climb in the second half.
Leaving the deal now would not buy a lasting political bounce for Trump in manufacturing-heavy swing states with five months to go before the presidential election, analysts say.
COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP 
Trump said on Friday that China was ""absolutely smothering Hong Kong’s freedom,"" but refrained from harsh sanctions that could put the trade deal in jeopardy, taking milder steps to revoke the territory s separate travel and customs benefits from China. 
Claire Reade, a former U.S. trade negotiator, said Trump s ""peripheral steps"" would not deter Beijing from proceeding with the security law, as it regards Hong Kong as a core national security issue. 
""Probably the most significant thing from the trade perspective is that the Phase 1 trade deal is – for now anyway - unaffected,"" said Reade, senior counsel with Arnold and Porter law firm in Washington. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has recently cited https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2020/may/usda-and-ustr-announce-continued-progress-implementation-us-china-phase-one-agreement ""continuing progress"" in the deal, after China welcomed U.S. blueberries, barley, beef and dairy products. 
U.S.-China flashpoints on Hong Kong, Taiwan and other issues did not derail negotiations that resulted in new concessions from China, said Jamieson Greer, who served as Lighthizer s chief of staff until April.
""Some of these security and human rights challenges have certainly complicated the atmosphere, but the trade agreement can still provide a set of rules governing important aspects of the trade relationship,"" said Greer, now an international trade partner at the King and Spalding law firm.

Another person familiar with USTR thinking said the agency ""needs to make Phase 1 look good. They want to show that progress is being made. The president looks at the China relationship much more broadly."""

Since early May Italy has been gradually easing restrictions on movement and business activities, but there is concern that infections may surge again if people don t stick to social distancing rules.
The app dubbed ""Immuni"" (immune) is aimed at reducing the risk of such flare-ups by recording when users are in close proximity with each other. Their mobile phones will exchange codes through Bluetooth technology.
If a person tests positive for the virus, the app tells recent contacts to self-isolate and get tested, helping health authorities to react quickly and limit contagion.
""In this way we will be able to identify someone who was sitting on the bus next to an infected person,"" Pier Luigi Lopalco, head of the COVID-19 emergency unit in the Puglia region which is among those piloting the app, told Reuters. 
There has been heated debate in Italy over possible privacy violations, but the government has said users  personal data will not be collected and the app will not geolocate them.
In addition, all recorded contact logs must be deleted once the health emergency is over or by Dec. 31 at the latest.
However only 44% of Italians said they would probably or certainly download Immuni, according to survey by pollster EMG Acqua on May 26, while 24% would definitely not download it.
On-the-ground testing of the app, which has been developed by tech start-up Bending Spoons, will start on June 8 in the Liguria, Abruzzo, Marche and Puglia regions.
Immuni is based on software launched last month by Apple  and Google , whose operating systems power 99% of the world s smartphones."

Investing.com -- Peaceful protests at the killing of an unarmed black man by police degenerate into riots and looting, while President Trump threatens governors with the imposition of martial law. China is going slow on its purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, while Germany is planning another big stimulus package - with its auto industry set to be one of the big beneficiaries. And oil prices are rising again as Russia and OPEC close in on an extension of their deal on output restraint. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 2nd.
1. U.S. cities hit by more violence
U.S. cities were rocked by another night of protests triggered by the killing of an unarmed black man by Minneapolis police.  Two separate autopsies conducted on George Floyd came to the conclusion of homicide, but offered different causes.  
The protests were marked on the one side by outbreaks of looting, and on the other by violence against both media and peaceful protestors as well as violent ones. President Donald Trump threatened in a call with state governors to send in combat troops if they failed to bring the situation in their states under control.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York would face another curfew tonight after widespread violence and looting in lower Manhattan overnight.  The protests threaten to derail the reopening of much of the U.S. economy, which analysts have repeatedly said depends heavily on consumer and business confidence rebounding.
2. China goes slow on farm goods purchases
Chinese government officials told major state-run agricultural companies to pause purchases of some U.S. farm goods including soybeans, Bloomberg reported, in a move that appears to undermine Beijing’s previous promises to increase purchases under the ‘Phase 1’ trade deal signed in January.
State-owned traders Cofco and Sinograin were ordered to suspend purchases while Chinese officials also told state-buyers to halt American cotton and corn imports, Bloomberg reported. It also noted that some pork purchases have been delayed.
The move is the latest development to reflect worsening relations between Beijing and Washington after the enactment of a new security law that the U.S. said ended the autonomy and freedoms of Hong Kong.
3. Stocks set to open higher, eye on reopenings
U.S. stock markets are poised to open higher, shrugging off the almost nationwide rioting and accompanying ballyhoo.
Markets are focusing more on the lifting of restrictions on the normal operation of businesses as efforts to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic get a helping hand from the start of summer.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 178 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.6%.
One stock in focus later will be Apple , which has cut prices for its iPhones in China in an attempt to revive flagging sales in the wake of the pandemic.
4. Germany pulls Europe higher with new stimulus package
The German stock market hit a three-month high, pulling European markets in its wake, amid reports that the government will debate a further stimulus package to the economy Tuesday.
Local media reports put the size of the package at between 80 and 100 billion euros (($89 to $111 billion), and said much of it will be aimed at the auto industry, which supports over 12% of the country’s jobs directly and indirectly.
Elsewhere in Europe, the EU and U.K. begin their last round of talks on trading relations after the current post-Brexit transitional phase lapses at the end of the year. The U.K. government has said it won’t seek an extension of the transition, which has kept conditions for businesses effectively  unchanged since the U.K. formally left the bloc earlier this year.
5. API oil inventories due as Russia, OPEC mull extension of output deal
Oil prices surged again on hopes that OPEC and Russia will extend their agreement on output restraint, which is due to lapse at the end of June.
The Russian government is scheduled to discuss the issue at a meeting Tuesday, according to local media reports, with at least one suggesting that Russia’s preference is for an extension of only one month.
In the U.S., the American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly data on U.S. inventories of crude and refined products at 4:30 PM ET as usual."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, with investors continuing to look for an economic recovery despite mounting civic unrest and increasing Sino-U.S. tensions.
At 06:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.6%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 60 points, or 0.6%. The Dow Futures contract rose 170 points, or 0.7%. 
This optimism is despite President Donald Trump threatening to deploy the military in U.S. cities. in response to the violent unrest that has followed last week’s death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of police, 
On top of this, relations between China and the U.S. remain strained over the autonomy of Hong Kong, after Beijing passed new national security laws related to the city.
Reports Monday of an order from China s government to halt U.S. soybean purchases raised the possibility of damaging trade disagreements between Washington and Beijing, just a few months after the first phase of a trade deal ending a damaging trade war. Chinese backsliding on the deal would give Trump the pretext to raise import tariffs on its goods again. 
That said, the latest U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index pointed to improvement in May from April, even though the reading was grim. The market is also still supported by trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus and the reopening of states as the coronavirus outbreak passes its peak.
In corporate news, Facebook  will be in focus after a number of employees walked out Monday in protest against the tech giant s decision not to remove or flag a controversial post by Trump last week. Apple  will also be in the spotlight after cutting prices for its new iPhone models in China, its second-biggest market.
Carnival  P&O Cruises said it is extending its pause in sailings to the middle of October as it continues to grapple with the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Zoom Video  is set to report earnings after the bell, and expectations for the company, which has become synonymous with working under lockdown restrictions for the Covid-19 pandemic, are high.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, with traders expecting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, to bring forward its next meeting to later this week in order to discuss whether to extend record production cuts beyond end-June.
The American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell. Last week the API reported that crude stockpiles climbed by 8.7 million barrels, bucking the recent downward trend.
At 5:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.7% higher at $36.38 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.6% to $39.30."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Should President Donald Trump and Twitter ultimately part ways, his campaign has a backup plan at the ready to get his voice out. 
Tensions between Trump and the messaging platform escalated last week after Twitter began to label some of his tweets with a fact-check. Trump responded with an executive order that threatens to curtail some legal protections enjoyed by social media companies.
Trump’s campaign has been building an alternative channel for him for months, a smartphone app that aims to become a one-stop news, information and entertainment platform for his supporters, in part because of concerns that the president would lose access to the Twitter platform, said his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.
The Trump app, which was launched in April, has since often placed among the Top 10 in Apple  s rankings of news apps, sometimes above those of individual news organizations such as CNN, the  New York Times   and Reuters.
“We have always been worried about Twitter and Facebook  taking us offline and this serves as a backup,” Parscale told Reuters.
He spoke before Twitter for the first time prompted readers to check the facts in Trump s tweets last week, warning that his claims about mail-in ballots were false and had been debunked by fact checkers.
For supporters, the new app is where they can get the latest campaign news, watch campaign-produced, prime-time shows hosted by Trump allies and earn reward points for making phone calls or signing people up for the app.
For the campaign, it is a pandemic-proof substitute to Trump s signature rallies, and a key tool to collect crucial data that can help micro-target voters ahead of November s election. Trump will face presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 contest.
With millions of Americans stuck at home and campaign rallies paused due to the coronavirus, successful digital organizing can make a difference, digital strategists in both parties say.
Signing into the app requires a cellphone number, which then allows the campaign to send the user regular text messages lauding Trump or asking for donations.
“The most important, golden thing in politics is a cellphone number,"" said Parscale, who ran Trump s digital efforts in 2016 before leading the 2020 campaign. “When we receive cellphone numbers, it really allows us to identify them across the databases. Who are they, voting history, everything.""
Reward points that users can earn by getting other people to sign up for the app can be used to buy campaign gear or even score a meeting with Trump himself, the campaign said. 
 DIGITAL MOUSETRAP 
Biden’s campaign has a phone app as well, where supporters can donate or volunteer, and text people directly with campaign messaging.
But unlike Trump s app, it provides little information, such as social media streams or news releases. Nor does it connect to the virtual campaign events Biden has been holding nearly daily during the coronavirus pandemic. The app is not ranked by Apple as among its 200 most popular for news. 
The Biden campaign said it uses its app almost solely for organizing supporters, not for pushing content. 
By contrast, according to Stefan Smith, a Democratic digital strategist who worked for Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, the Trump app has created a “walled garden” or “digital mousetrap” where voters ideally stay as long as possible, interacting with the app’s steady stream of content.
""The Trump campaign is a media company with an electoral component,"" Smith said. 
The Trump campaign hired Texas-based company Phunware  to build the app. 
If they so choose, users can rely on the app as a primary, if heavily filtered, information source, one where Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is championed and the economy is poised for a quick recovery and the federal probe into Trump s collusion with Russia was a politically motivated hoax.
Not included is less favorable coverage of the president. On Monday, the app contained a campaign statement framed like a news article that said Trump had been working to unite the county in the wake of nationwide protests over the police shooting of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
There was no mention of a combative conference call Trump had with U.S. governors in which he urged them to act more aggressively toward the protesters.
Bill Bigby, a Trump supporter in Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the app has now become his go-to source for the latest news. 
""We have learned that you can’t trust anything the media says about Trump,"" Bigby, 56, said. ""They just don’t like him.""
Parscale said that was exactly the goal the campaign had in mind.

“I think everything we do is to counter the media,” Parscale said. “This is another tool in the tool shed to fight that fight, and it’s a big tool.”"

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Tuesday, even as the wave of sometimes violent protests in response to the killing of an unarmed black man by policy weighed on hopes for a successful reopening of the U.S. economy as the Covid-19 pandemic eases.
By 10:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 218 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 was 0.5% higher. The Nasdaq Composite, inched up by 0.1%, reversing earlier losses.
The optimism caused by the sight of dozens of states slowly relaxing restrictions on business and social life has run into some second thoughts, as a wave of protests against the killing of George Floyd has engendered looting and anti-police violence on the one side, and unrestrained abuse of peaceful protesters and media on the other.  
New York City, which is still emerging from its Covid-19 lockdown, will be under curfew for a second straight evening on Tuesday after widespread looting in Lower Manhattan late on Monday. With similar scenes being replicated in cities across the country, the hoped-for return of consumers to shops, bars, movie theaters and the like is being pushed back. 
Starbucks  stock fell 1.0%, having earlier been the subject of reports saying it would ask staff to choose between unpaid leave and reduced working hours as it plots a slow path back to normality.
That the rebound in consumer demand may be elusive was also evident in China overnight, where it emerged that Apple is discounting its new iPhone models heavily to sustain sales.  Apple Inc  stock fell 0.1%.
Elsewhere, Dick’s Sporting Goods  stock rose 1.8% after reporting that online sales more than doubled in the three months through April, although same-store sales fell 30% due to Covid-19 related lockdowns."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India launched a $6.65 billion plan on Tuesday to boost electronics manufacturing, saying it would start by offering five global smartphone makers incentives to establish or expand domestic production.
The government is offering a production-linked incentive (PLI) involving cash worth 4% to 6% of additional sales of goods made locally over five years, with 2019-2020 as the base year, technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told a news conference.
Names of the five companies, which would have to meet investment and sales thresholds to be eligible, were expected to be announced in the next two months, ministry officials said.
Five Indian firms would also be selected for the PLI scheme, which, along with two other related initiatives, could help India produce smartphones and components worth 10 trillion rupees ($133 billion) by 2025, Prasad said.
The smartphone industry has become a showpiece for Prime Minister Narendra Modi s  Make In India  drive. The government now wants to make the country an export hub.
Global players such as Samsung (KS:005930) and Taiwanese firms Foxconn and Wistron, which both supply Apple , have already ramped up local production, attracted by India s huge market of 1.3 billion people.
The new plan also includes schemes to drive up production of components and create manufacturing clusters with pre-built factory sheds and common facilities for companies to move in immediately.
""We want the bridegrooms to come but we also want the entire wedding procession. A company coming (to India) should also bring the entire procession of its ancillaries,"" Prasad said.
The plan comes as more companies look for manufacturing sites outside China, where the coronavirus pandemic disrupted global supply chains. India, which offers cheap labor, has more than 1 billion mobile connections but less than half that number of smartphones, offering manufacturers a huge potential market.

Investing.com – The Dow climbed Tuesday, led by energy, as investors weighed the effect of widespread protests in the U.S. against ongoing progress to reopen the economy.       
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.63%, or 160 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.41%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.22%.
Against ongoing violent protests over the death of George Floyd that extended overnight, investors continued to bet that disruptions to the progress of reopening are unlikely to knock the odds of a recovery in the second half of the year.        
Cyclical corners of the market sensitive to the reopening progress such as manufacturers, energy companies, and banks continued to catch a bid.
 Citigroup   and  Morgan Stanley   were up about 2%, while Bank of America  rose 0.55% after pledging to commit $1 billion over four years to support economic and racial inequality accelerated by a global pandemic.
Energy also led the broader market higher, supported by a jump in oil prices to nearly three-month highs on expectations that major producers will extend production cuts when they meet virtually later this week.
RBC Capital Markets  Helima Croft said major oil producers are expected to agree a one- to three-month extension.

Many companies paused normal work and directed their efforts to support the work of Black Lives Matter and other social justice groups.
Streaming service Spotify  highlighted the music of black artists, Sirius XM  Radio said it would silence its music channels for three minutes, and Apple  Music DJ Zane Lowe tweeted that he wouldn t host his radio show but would be ""listening, learning and looking for solutions to fight racial inequality.""
The death last week of Floyd, an unarmed black man, as a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into Floyd s neck, unleashed a wave of outrage in cities around the United States about the treatment of black Americans, further polarizing a country politically and racially.
The Blackout Tuesday movement was prompted by two U.S. record industry executives to pressure the music business to improve the presence of black people in its corporate ranks, noting that the industry had ""profited predominantly from black art."" Rap and R&B overtook rock in 2017 to become the biggest music genre in the United States.
The movement was quickly embraced by record labels, celebrities including Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and basketball player LeBron James and ordinary Americans.
It also gave rise to dissenters. Black Lives Matter complained that news of its planned protests had been drowned out, while film executive Franklin Leonard said he would not be taking part.
""A  show  of solidarity is NOT solidarity,"" Leonard tweeted. ""And posting a black tile on your Instagram feed for a day definitely isn’t.""
Elsewhere, video-sharing platform TikTok donated $4 million to non-profits that help the black community while eBay  in the United States said it would donate all fees collected on Tuesday from items sold in its music categories to a charity that supports equality.
ViacomCBS  said it will be ""on pause"" on Tuesday, a day after CBS News, MTV and Comedy Central went dark for 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the length of time Floyd s neck was pinned to the ground by the knee of a police officer.

Violent protests continued to erupt across U.S. cities over the death of George Floyd and threaten to undo some of the economic reopening progress made so far.
Several companies, including  Target  , Walmart , and Apple  temporarily shut some of their stores as protests turned violent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An advocacy group backed by the tech industry sued President Donald Trump on Tuesday over his executive order that would weaken a law protecting online platforms including social media companies that label or fact-check his posts.
The Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) said in its lawsuit that Trump s executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies. It noted that the order was issued after  Twitter Inc   amended one of Trump s tweets and called it ""plainly retaliatory."" 
The lawsuit argues that Trump s executive order will ""chill future online speech by other speakers"" and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online. 
Trump, in an attempt to regulate social media platforms where he has been criticized, said last week he will introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook.
The proposed legislation was part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.
Trump said he wants to ""remove or change"" a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users. He also said Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation ""immediately"" to regulate social media companies.
In a tweet, Twitter said attempts to unilaterally erode the law could threaten the future of online speech. The White House and Justice Department declined comment on the lawsuit. 
""Twitter appended the President’s tweets... in immediate retaliation, the President issued the Executive Order,"" said the lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
CDT s donors include Alphabet  s Google,  Facebook Inc  , Apple  and Microsoft , according to the Capital Research Center, a right-leaning non-profit think tank.

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only disrupted business supply chains, with major smartphone makers such as Apple Inc  and Samsung Electronics  Co Ltd flagging financial hits, but also squeezed consumer spending worldwide. 
""Nationwide lockdowns and rising unemployment have reduced consumer confidence and reprioritized spending towards essential goods, directly impacting the uptake of smartphones in the short term"", said https:// Sangeetika Srivastava, senior research analyst with IDC.
Apple, which was forced to shut retail stores in the United States and Europe following the outbreak, introduced discounts on the iPhone 11 in China and released a new low-price SE model to weather a plunge in global smartphone demand.
Research firm TrendForce said in April it expected global smartphone production to slump a record 16.5% in the June quarter from a year earlier.
That follows a 10% drop in output worldwide in the March quarter, when the outbreak spread and peaked in China before sweeping through Europe and the United States.
However, shipments from China s factories to vendors rose 17% in April from a year earlier, suggesting signs of an early rebound in domestic demand in the world s largest smartphone market.
In China, where the economy has begun to reopen and factories have resumed operations, IDC expects a single-digit decline in this year.

The research firm also expects upcoming 5G deployment to help the recovery of smartphone shipments next year, adding it does not expect growth to return until the first quarter of 2021."

(Reuters) - A federal judge said Apple Inc  must face part of a lawsuit claiming it fraudulently concealed falling demand for iPhones, especially in China, leading to tens of billions of dollars in shareholder losses.
While dismissing most claims, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers  ruled late Tuesday that shareholders can sue over Chief Executive Tim Cook s comments touting strong iPhone demand on a Nov. 1, 2018 analyst call, only a few days before Apple told its largest manufacturers to curb production.
""Absent some natural disaster or other intervening reason, it is simply implausible that Cook would not have known that iPhone demand in China was falling mere days before cutting production lines,"" Rogers wrote.
The Oakland, California-based judge also said a decision by Apple to stop reporting iPhone unit sales ""plausibly suggests that defendants expected unit sales to decline.""
Apple did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.
The complaint, led by the Employees  Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island, came after Cook on Jan. 2, 2019 unexpectedly reduced Apple s quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, in part because of U.S.-China trade tensions.
It was the first time since the iPhone s 2007 launch that the Cupertino, California-based company had cut its revenue forecast. Apple stock fell 10% the next day, erasing $74 billion of market value.
Cook had said on the analyst call that the iPhone XS and XS Max had a ""really great start,"" and that while some emerging markets faced downward sales pressures ""I would not put China in that category.""
By mid-November 2018, Apple had told the manufacturers Foxconn and Pagatron to halt plans for new iPhone production lines, and a key supplier had been told to materially reduce shipments, the complaint said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - From its Silicon Valley-like campus near Mumbai, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani s Jio telecom carrier is emerging as a winner from changes in the way Indian consumers plug into a digital economy made more urgent by the coronavirus pandemic.
For Indian shoppers who prefer to order online, it is launching a grocery ordering service with  Facebook Inc  s  popular WhatsApp messaging. For Bollywood fans who would prefer to avoid a crowded theater, it is readying same-day-release on the Jio platform.
Those plans had been in the making for months, but the pandemic has given them a shot in the arm. India s 10-week lockdown has also led to a surge in demand for data, boosting Jio s phone and broadband offerings.
And, over the past six weeks, the digital business of Ambani s  Reliance Industries  Ltd , known as Jio Platforms, raised a striking $10 billion from global investors.
The investments, including $5.7 billion from Facebook and money from private equity firms Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic and KKR & Co Inc , value Jio Platforms, where Reliance last year announced it was consolidating its digital offerings, at roughly $65 billion. 
They also put Jio on track toward a goal Ambani described last year: an eventual listing that would mark a milestone for his effort to unite the digital offerings of his sprawling conglomerate, from set-top boxes to e-commerce and home automation.
Reliance declined to make Ambani, Asia s richest man, available for interview or respond to a detailed list of questions. 
But interviews with a dozen people familiar with the company s development efforts show how Reliance has pushed aggressive pricing for a one-stop digital commerce platform that incorporates features modeled on the American tech heavyweights it sees as rivals.
When Jio set out to launch a set-top box, it tasked a team with analysing – and in some cases replicating - some 100 features of an Apple TV set-top box last year, according to a person close to the project and internal Jio documents seen by Reuters. 
""Presentation and listing of menu items should be similar to Apple TV,"" one of the documents says, assigning the task a ""Priority 1"" rating.
One document compares the products  features, like average weight. Another includes instructions like ""Matching the background theme of Launcher (home screen) to that of Apple TV.""
Jio s set-top box comes included in its broadband plans, with the cheapest annual deal costing around $110, whereas Apple TV 4K is selling for around $210 to $230 on Indian e-commerce sites.
Apple Inc  did not respond to requests for comment.
Jio also analysed Amazon  s Alexa voice assistant with the aim of coming up with its own offering, according to one person with knowledge of Jio s strategy. ""They wanted to say:  Hey Jio, can you switch on the lights? ,"" said the person. Reuters could not determine the status of the project. Amazon declined comment. 
In other areas, Ambani has shown a willingness to bet big on emerging technology. In India, Jio was an early adopter of voice-over-LTE, which is more efficient than traditional networks. The company expects that to give it an edge in rolling out 5G services.
""Few companies have the potential to transform a country s digital ecosystem in the way that Jio Platforms is doing in India,"" said KKR s co-founder Henry Kravis in announcing his investment. 
In partnership with Facebook s WhatsApp, Reliance has launched a new service that allows consumers to order from their local grocery stores at a time when many Indian consumers, like shoppers elsewhere, are trying to minimize trips to stores. The service was rolled out in April in three areas of Greater Mumbai. 
""Reliance wants to be a global technology powerhouse,"" said Rahul Malhotra, an analyst with Bernstein. ""With the Facebook partnership, they will build the WeChat of India,"" he added, referring to Tencent Holdings  (HK:0700) messaging, payments and social media app that is ubiquitous in China.
TOTAL RELIANCE
Ambani dominates a dizzying array of sectors: Jio is India s leading telecoms carrier, Reliance Retail Limited is its top brick-and-mortar retailer, Reliance s Network18 Media & Investments Limited is one of its biggest news networks, and Reliance s Jamnagar is its largest oil complex.
His empire also produces films at Jio Studios and runs India s top soccer tournament, the Indian Super League.
By providing Indian consumers access to everything from groceries and clothes to banking and home automation via an integrated system running through Jio, Ambani hopes Reliance can become what he calls an ""everything company.""
To help back its retail push, Reliance in March asked an Indian logistics provider for some 5 million square feet of warehousing space, according to a person briefed on the plans.
That comes after a 2019 request for service, reviewed by Reuters, that said the company was seeking 1.1 million square feet of warehousing space that would be ""expandable in future."" 
Reliance has not made public details of its warehousing space. By comparison, Amazon said in 2017 it had warehouses covering about 3 million square feet in India and has expanded since then. Amazon did not provide Reuters with an updated figure.
In addition to an eventual listing for Jio, Ambani has said he would look to list Reliance s retail operations as well.
Jio s other planned offerings include home viewings for films on the day of their theater release and networked security systems for cars.
But Jio s broadband rollout, which is key for many of its planned digital offerings, has hit glitches, in part because the company had not initially set up sufficient customer support services, according to two employees and internal chat messages reviewed by Reuters. And unlike in telecoms, Reliance has not offered steep discounts to attract new customers. 
Ambani s ambition of creating a homegrown tech company took shape when Jio was launched in 2016 with aggressively priced data plans. Suddenly, migrant construction workers were video-chatting with their families, farmers were checking crop prices, and office workers were screening films during their commutes home on crammed trains.
Jio s competitors, then numbering around a dozen, were forced to slash prices, quit, or merge as Reliance pumped in at least $30 billion in oil-related earnings to subsidize prices. ""We have to bleed others to death - I remember that as a refrain,"" said one former high-level Reliance executive, who asked not to be named.
Some rivals held out for longer than expected and Reliance ended up investing more than originally planned, according to a half-dozen sources who worked at Reliance or were briefed on the company s ramp-up.

Last year, Jio became India s No. 1 carrier by number of users. Meanwhile, rival  Vodafone   Idea Ltd , a venture between the Indian unit of Britain s Vodafone Group Plc  and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla s  Idea Cellular , has warned it may not survive having to pay about $4 billion in overdue levies and interest to the government."

The tax would apply to revenues booked locally by tech firms such as Facebook , Alphabet  Inc s Google, Apple  and Amazon  and would generate about 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) in annual revenues for the state.
The U.S. Trade Representative s office said on Tuesday it was launching a ""Section 301"" investigation into digital services taxes that have been adopted or are being considered by Spain and other U.S. trade partners.
""We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.
Finalising Spain s legislation will take 3-4 months in light of the challenges in agreeing a final text faced by the minority government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
Spain s tax would take effect only if Organization for Cooperation and Development (OECD) member states reach agreement to launch a joint digital levy - an effort to take better account of the rise of big tech companies that often book profits in low-tax countries.
""It is a transitional and provisional decision until a regulation is approved at international or at least European level,"" Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero told lawmakers.
If approved, the bill would apply a levy of 3% on the local digital revenue of companies with annual global sales of more than 750 million euros and at least 3 million in Spain, lining up with an European Union proposal on the matter.
France is among EU countries that have already passed a digital tax which it plans to apply this year regardless of whether there is progress towards an OECD-wide deal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A bet on tech companies has been a solid one in the aftermath of the coronavirus-induced market crash, but some investors are questioning whether those stocks can maintain their momentum if jobs do not recover soon. 
Less than three months after the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus spurred unprecedented lockdowns across the United States, pushing the unemployment rate to levels not seen since the Great Depression, the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) on Thursday briefly notched a new intraday high, making it the first major stock benchmark to post new highs since the crash. 
With more than 75% of the weight of the full Nasdaq Composite among its constituents, the Nasdaq 100 is the benchmark for the popular Invesco ETF QQQ , the 5th-largest equity ETF with more than $108 billion in assets, according to Lipper. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC), meanwhile, remains about 2% below its record close.
Yet while the pandemic has benefited technology companies - and their investors - by driving greater adaptation of ecommerce, remote work and cloud computing, for instance, the risk is that the slowdown in the real economy will soon catch up to the gains. 
""No matter who you are, you need healthy customers who have a budget to pay you,"" said Kevin Landis, portfolio manager of the Firsthand Funds, who expects companies he holds such as streaming firm  Roku  Inc  and online education company  Chegg Inc   to struggle to expand if unemployment remains high. ""If the overall economy suffers that is going to take some steam out of the tech companies eventually."" 
So far, the Nasdaq Composite has proven more resilient than other broad market benchmarks, in part because it has little exposure to sectors such as energy, retail and travel companies whose shares have cratered 50% or more since the start of the year. The S&P is around 8% below its own all-time closing high, hit on Feb. 19. 
In addition, cash-rich technology companies have become a safety play during a time of market turmoil, crowding investors into a small number of stocks such as Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Inc  and Apple Inc , said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. 
""Owning tech in this environment is considered not speculative but safer than consumer brands that would have traditionally been safe,"" said Cox, adding that many large technology companies now pay attractive dividends.
A number of well-known companies, including Amazon,  Facebook Inc   and  Zoom Video Communications  , have already soared past the highs they notched before the coronavirus crisis. 
RISING RISKS
The impact of a sustained slowdown in the economy has so far been masked by widespread expectations of further stimulus measures from Congress or the Federal Reserve, said Jim Callinan, portfolio manager of Osterweis Emerging Opportunity Fund, leaving the Nasdaq primed for an outsized fall if those measures fail to materialize. 
""We really need to make sure that consumers are okay and feeling good within their economic viability,"" Callinan said.
With the valuation of technology stocks stretched overall, investors should gravitate toward companies that rely less on the direction of the economy, said Mike Lippert, a portfolio manager of the Baron Opportunity Fund. 
Lippert has been adding to companies such as cybersecurity firm  Crowdstrike Holdings Inc   and cloud communications firm RingCentral Inc  that are likely to be adopted by businesses regardless of the broader consumer backdrop. 
Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist for the  Wells Fargo   Asset Management Multi-Asset Solutions team, said his firm remains long on the Nasdaq while shorting the S&P 500. Still, he is cautious that economic demand may start to slow. 
""Businesses are feeling pressure to invest in technology as employees who are accustomed to working from home will want to continue doing so with better in-home set-ups,"" he said. ""But at some point there needs to be an economic turnaround to justify the spend.""

MUEHLBACH AM MANHARTSBERG, Austria (Reuters) - European countries cautiously emerging from the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic are looking to a second generation of contact tracing apps to help contain further outbreaks.
The latest apps have big advantages over earlier ones as they work on Apple  s iPhone, one of the most popular smartphones in Europe, and do not rely on centralized databases that could compromise privacy.
Switzerland, Latvia and Italy have opted for Bluetooth short-range radio for their apps, based on technology from Apple and Google  that securely logs exchanges on the smartphones of people who have been near each other.
Around 30% of smartphones in Europe run on Apple s iOS operating system, with nearly all of the rest using Google s Android. Together they host 99% of the world s smartphones.
""The fundamental challenge will be if the second wave comes,"" said Ingmars Pukis, a board member at mobile network operator LMT, which is backing the Latvian app.
""We hope we will be ready with sufficient functionality and penetration to manage a future outbreak,"" Pukis said.
Dozens of countries have launched or plan contact tracing apps using either Bluetooth or location-tracking technology to notify people quickly of possible coronavirus exposure, with China, South Korea and India using more invasive approaches.
However, developers of the Swiss-Covid app hope to show that it can contribute to Switzerland s broader ""test, trace, isolate and quarantine"" strategy, without even knowing where people come into contact.
The Bluetooth-based app is now being trialled after army volunteers tested whether it could work in settings such as a cafeteria lunch, a train journey, a shop queue or a house party.
The Swiss app is intended to complement manual contact tracing, with a phone call from a tracer as well as an app notification providing double confirmation that a person is at risk.
""Hopefully there will be a strong overlap,"" said Marcel Salathe, a digital epidemiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.
Several other countries, including Estonia, Finland, Ireland and Portugal, are working on similar decentralized apps.
There are still potential flaws as Bluetooth was not originally designed to accurately measure distance. And while mass public take-up is needed for such apps to work, relatively few elderly people, who are at greatest risk, have smartphones.
Latvia is bolting on extra features, with users getting an exposure notification given the option to share their number and get a call from a contact tracer. In a delicate trade-off between privacy and utility, it will be possible in a planned update to share health symptoms and receive advice.
SUPER-SPREADING
The first generation of contact tracing apps rushed out in March and April had little impact and raised privacy alarms, with Australia s requiring people to register their name and phone number, something Apple refused to support.
Although the Australian app has been downloaded nearly 6 million times, reports and government statements last month said it has only helped trace a single case.
Germany s Covid-Warn-App, due out in mid-June, seeks to rule out such privacy risks from the outset.
""There is no symptom sharing. No data collection. All data is pseudonymous,"" said Harald Lindlar of Deutsche Telekom , which is working with SAP on the app.
Italy has launched a similarly minimalist app, called Immuni, in four regions. France, by contrast, has gone live with a centralized app, despite the lack of Apple support.
Apple and Google said when they released their toolkit for Bluetooth apps last month that authorities in 23 countries had sought access to it. Early adopters Singapore and Australia are considering shifting to their joint standard.
Austria s Stopp Corona, Europe s first Bluetooth app which has had 600,000 downloads, is one which upgrading to conform to the Google-Apple framework.
""Things could change quickly in the case of a renewed outbreak that we must at all costs prevent - this is where the app can provide ideal support,"" Michael Zettel, Austria chief at consulting group Accenture , told Reuters.

""The app makes a lot of sense - for example in churches, clubs and sports teams. It can help quickly to contain super-spreading events,"" Zettel added. "

HONG KONG (Reuters) - When a team of producers at Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) heard on May 19 that the publicly funded broadcaster planned to axe one of its most popular weekly shows, they rushed to the building next door to confront the station s head.
A group of about 20 producers and other employees from RTHK’s TV and radio operations barged into a conference room where Leung Ka-wing, director of broadcasting, was meeting with top executives. 
Some staff demanded to know why the satirical and current affairs television show “Headliner” – which had drawn official complaints after poking fun at the Hong Kong police in an episode in February - was being cancelled, and whether the move was prompted by pressure from authorities.
The impromptu meeting lasted about 90 minutes, during which several staffers cried and raised their voices, according to three people present. Leung said he took the decision to cancel the show in order to “protect RTHK” and its staff, according to the three people.  
As conversations continued inside the conference room, RTHK announced it was suspending production of the Chinese-language show, which had been running since 1989, at the end of the current season. RTHK apologized to anyone offended by the station’s output but did not give a reason for the suspension. 
Leung, 67, who made his name in broadcasting during the Tiananmen Square  crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in 1989, declined to answer Reuters’ questions about the meeting. He denied making the comment about protecting RTHK, according to RTHK spokeswoman Amen Ng. Other executives in the meeting that Reuters could identify did not reply to requests for comment. 
Hong Kong’s government did not comment on whether it had pressured Leung to cancel the show. 
RTHK, founded in 1928 and sometimes compared to the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the only independent, publicly funded media outlet on Chinese soil. It is guaranteed editorial independence by its charter.
The cancellation of “Headliner” has prompted fear among some journalists that mounting pressure from the Hong Kong government and Beijing will destroy that independence. 
Hong Kong reached boiling point last summer as millions of pro-democracy protesters took to the streets and some of them clashed violently with police, posing one of the biggest challenges to China’s leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
In response to the protests, China said last month it would introduce national security legislation in Hong Kong to prohibit secession, subversion and external interference. More than a dozen people working at RTHK and other media organizations told Reuters they fear that legislation could be used to silence or shut down independent media in the territory.
The situation is like being under the blade of a guillotine, said Jimmy Lai, the publisher of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy Apple  Daily newspaper, which like RTHK, has for years drawn the ire of Hong Kong’s government and Beijing: “There’s no half-way. It’s falling.”
Lai, 72, has been repeatedly denounced by state-run Beijing media and pro-China media in Hong Kong, painting him as the local face of what they describe as a U.S. interference campaign. He has been arrested twice this year on charges of illegal assembly related to protests last year.
Lai and some other members of the media fear the new legislation - which has not yet been set out in detail - will make Hong Kong more like mainland China, where the ruling Communist Party runs or controls the vast majority of media and routinely censors dissenting views. The country imprisoned at least 48 journalists last year, more than any other country, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam has denied the new legislation would curtail media freedom, saying last month that “freedom of expression, freedom of protest, freedom of journalism, will stay.” Hong Kong is guaranteed freedom of speech and the press under Article 27 of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution agreed by China when it took back control of former British colony in 1997.
A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Reuters the proposed legislation “only targets activities related to subversion, separatism, terrorism and foreign interference into Hong Kong affairs,” and that it will “not affect freedom of speech, media freedoms, or any other rights and freedoms.”  
China’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Beijing’s official base in the city, did not reply to requests for comment on whether China sought to control or suppress RTHK or if the new national security legislation would curtail media freedom in Hong Kong.
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
Scrutiny of RTHK has increased dramatically since late February, when a two-minute segment on “Headliner” entitled ‘Police Farce Report’ showed an actor dressed as a Hong Kong police officer standing inside a large rubbish container with his hands covered in plastic. 
The skit shows police in various situations wearing biohazard suits and masks, satirizing how well equipped police officers are compared to medical workers. The actor, Kwong Ngai-yee, told Reuters the idea was based on the “Sesame Street” puppet Oscar the Grouch and that he hoped to “ease public anger through humour.”
Hong Kong police were not amused. The force’s commissioner Chris Tang complained to Leung in writing in early March, saying the show ""smeared the police and their work during the coronavirus period."" RTHK had ""reversed right and wrong, and we simply can t accept it,"" Tang wrote in the letter, which was made public by RTHK. 
On the morning of May 19, Hong Kong’s Communications Authority, which regulates the city’s broadcast and telecoms sectors, published a report criticizing the broadcaster, saying the segment “smeared the police by suggesting that the police were trash, worthless and revulsive.”
As the RTHK employees met with Leung that evening, Hong Kong’s Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, which oversees RTHK, released a statement on its website demanding that the broadcaster examine its production and editorial processes and “follow up or take disciplinary actions” on any staff found to have committed ""negligence or errors.""
Nine days later, the Commerce Bureau announced an unprecedented, government-led review of RTHK’s governance and management – spanning its administration, financial control and manpower - to ensure it complies with its charter. The review is expected to be concluded by the end of the year.
A spokesman for the Commerce Bureau told Reuters in an email that RTHK has editorial independence, but as a government department, RTHK and its staff “are subject to all applicable government rules and regulations.”
“Ultimately RTHK is part of the government, and in theory it could do anything to us,” said Gladys Chiu, the chairperson of RTHK’s programme staff union, which represents about 400 of the station s 700 staff. The new legislation and increased scrutiny of RTHK could be used ""to coerce the staff into broadcasting or reporting in a way that is approved by the government,"" she said. 
RTHK also faces pressures at street level. Small groups of pro-Beijing protesters regularly gather outside its headquarters in Kowloon, waving Chinese flags and signs accusing the broadcaster of anti-government bias.
“Shut it down,” the crowds chanted continuously during one protest in January, according to video news coverage, while calling RTHK a “cockroach” station, a description some police have used to describe pro-democracy protesters.
Some RTHK staff have been threatened in social media posts and targeted in the pro-Beijing media in Hong Kong for perceived anti-government bias. Some pro-Beijing lawmakers also routinely attack RTHK. One outspoken critic, Junius Ho, last month demanded the broadcaster become a “government mouthpiece.” 
“It’s very worrying because we see RTHK being reined in by every means,” said Shirley Yam, vice chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. 
RISING TENSION
China and the United States have been engaged in a tit-for-tat spat over the presence of the other’s journalists for several months. 
The United States slashed the number of journalists permitted to work at Chinese state-owned media outlets in the country to 100 from 160, citing a deepening crackdown on independent reporting inside China. In March, Beijing revoked the media credentials of about a dozen American reporters working in mainland China for the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and  New York Times  , saying the reporters would not be allowed to relocate and work in Hong Kong.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on the State Department’s website last month that the Chinese government “has threatened to interfere with the work of American journalists in Hong Kong,” without giving details. 
A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that if the row with the United States escalates further, Beijing could intervene in the issuance of work visas for foreign journalists in Hong Kong.
The spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: ""Visa  issues are a matter of national sovereignty. The Chinese government manages affairs related to foreign media and foreign journalists according to laws and regulations.""
Intervening in the issuance of journalists’ visas would be a highly contentious move for Hong Kong, which although part of China, operates with a high degree of autonomy. In 2018, the visa of the Financial Times’ Asia editor, Victor Mallet, was not renewed by Hong Kong after he moderated a speech by a pro-independence activist at an event hosted by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCC) in the city. The move alarmed some diplomats and business groups in Hong Kong. 
The event angered China, and a senior official said at the time that the FCC had broken the law by hosting a ""separatist."" Hong Kong authorities never publicly explained why Mallet’s visa had not been renewed, saying they could not comment on individual cases.
Hong Kong’s global media freedom ranking is in free-fall. Reporters without Borders (RSF) said Hong Kong fell to 80th place in 2020 in its global press freedom index, down from 18th in 2002. Over the past year, reporters covering protests in the city have been detained, pepper-sprayed and shot with rubber bullets and tear gas canisters by police. 

“A security law dictated by China would give a massive blow to press freedom in Hong Kong,” said Cédric Alviani, the head of RSF’s East Asia bureau. “(It would) allow the regime to engage in the type of intimidation that we see on their side of the border.”"

(Reuters) - The heavyweight technology and growth stocks that drove Wall Street higher in recent years are again fueling a surge that has taken the Nasdaq from a brutal selloff to an intraday record high in just 11 weeks, as investors look beyond the economic upheaval caused by the coronavirus. 
The Nasdaq s 43% rise since late March puts the tech-heavy index far ahead of the broader S&P 500, highlighting investors  willingness to bet that tech and communication companies will emerge stronger from the pandemic. 
The Nasdaq index on Friday closed 2.06% higher on the day after earlier surpassing the previous intraday record high hit Feb. 19, just before fears of the coronavirus ended Wall Street s 11-year bull market. The Nasdaq on Friday ended just short of its record high closing level, also set Feb. 19.

The Nasdaq s intraday high on Friday came after the monthly payrolls report surprised investors with the addition of 2.5 million jobs in May, providing the clearest evidence yet that the U.S. economy is headed for a quicker-than-anticipated recovery from lockdowns designed to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Even so, the road to recovery could be long and the jobless rate, at 13.3% last month, remains high, and many businesses are not expected to survive.

Many investors in recent months have bet that massive corporations with robust balance sheets will build on competitive advantages and grab market share from smaller rivals struggling to survive the global health crisis. 
Microsoft , Apple  and Alphabet  have outperformed most stocks within the Nasdaq, while Amazon  and Facebook  have set record highs in recent weeks. Their strong performance has increased the group s concentration within the Nasdaq, extending a trend seen in recent years.

Since Feb. 19, the end of the previous Nasdaq bull market, Amazon s stock market value has increased by over $150 billion, far more than any other U.S. company, as investors bet that shopping will move further online and that Amazon s cloud computing business will grow quickly. Alphabet, still down 6% since Feb. 19, has lost about $25 billion, more than any other U.S. company, according to Refinitiv data. Microsoft and Apple are Wall Street s most valuable companies.

Due to the cloudy economic outlook, many companies in recent months have withdrawn or declined to provide earnings guidance, making it difficult for investors to value stocks based on future earnings. Still, the Nasdaq currently trades at a trailing price/earnings multiple of 31, a level last seen in 2004 in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

The high-end French department store opened the outlet, about a tenth of the size of its flagship store on Boulevard Haussmann, in March 2019 as a retail laboratory to test new sales techniques and fashion labels.
But with borders still closed to foreign tourists and French consumers cautious, France s most famous shopping street is a shadow of its former self following the end of a nationwide lockdown on May 11. 
""It is very hard. We reopened the Champs Elysees store on May 11 but we have to face the fact that a lot of customers are missing,"" Galeries Lafayette Chief Executive Nicolas Houze said on BFM Business radio.
Houze said that since the reopening of its stores, traffic is down by about 20% compared to normal times and opening hours have been shortened for now. He said the crisis would impact the wider group s accounts by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) or more. 
""International clients may be missing till year-end or beyond and that will weigh heavily because the Haussmann shop gets more than half of its revenue from foreigners,"" the CEO said.
He added that the family-owned company, which has 61 stores in France and abroad, was in talks with banks and the finance ministry about a 300 million euro state-guaranteed loan. 
Houze said a lot of major brands on the Champs Elysees, including the Apple  store, had not yet reopened and many hotels and cinemas remain closed. 
""Traffic is very low and it is difficult to earn a revenue there. But we are convinced that Galeries Lafayette has a place on Champs Elysees.""
The store had already suffered from the ""yellow vest"" protest movement last year, when the boulevard was repeatedly hit by rioting and looting.

The upper chamber of parliament already approved the app last week, meaning it is likely to pass final formal votes in both chambers next week, allowing the government to adopt a decree implementing the scheme. 
Several European countries are looking to a second generation of contact tracing apps that work on Apple  s iPhone, one of the most popular smartphones in Europe, and do not rely on centralised databases that could compromise privacy.
The SwissCovid app, whose use is voluntary, uses Bluetooth short-range radio and technology from Apple and Google  to detect when a user has spent time close to another app user. It stores the data on the user s mobile phone for 21 days, allowing notification of close encounters with infected people.
Around 30% of smartphones in Europe run on Apple s iOS operating system, with nearly all of the rest using Google s Android. Together they host 99% of the world s smartphones.
Switzerland has reported 30,972 cases of coronavirus and 1,661 deaths but has started easing restrictions on public life as the number of new cases each day has fallen sharply, with just seven reported on Monday.
The Swiss app is being trialled after army volunteers tested whether it could work in settings such as a cafeteria, a train journey, a shop queue or a house party.

It is intended to complement manual contact tracing, with a phone call from a tracer as well as an app notification providing double confirmation that a person is at risk."

(Reuters) - On the same day that the Nasdaq marked a new bull market, the U.S. economy was officially declared to be in a recession. The two milestones on Monday illustrate how an 11-week surge in stocks has occurred despite widespread economic devastation fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.
Driven higher in recent months by surging technology and communications stocks, the Nasdaq (IXIC) closed up 0.8% on Monday at 9,924.75 points, exceeding its previous record high on Feb. 19, just before fears of the coronavirus ended its 11-year bull market. 
Stocks added to gains late in the session after the U.S. Federal Reserve eased the terms of its ""Main Street"" lending program.
The index s 44% climb from its March 23 low stands in contrast to sharp deteriorations in gross domestic product and other economic indicators as a result of nationwide lockdowns, which are now easing. 
(Graphic: Wall St vs Main St, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbyengvq/main%20St.jpg)
The index s 11-week surge has been the largest in that amount of time since late 2001, during the dot-com boom. Closing at a record high confirms, by a common definition, that the Nasdaq began a new bull market following its March 23 low.
Wall Street for months has appeared to ignore grim economic readings as investors focus on trillions of dollars in government stimulus and bet that a recovery would be relatively quick. 
Underscoring that disconnect and confirming wide expectations, the private research group that acts as the arbiter for determining U.S. business cycles said on Monday that the U.S. economy ended its longest expansion in history in February, and entered recession as a result of the coronavirus.

The National Bureau of Economic Research said, ""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions."" 
The S&P 500, the most widely followed U.S. stock index, remains down about 5% from its Feb. 19 record high as uncertainty about the recovery lingers. The Nasdaq s outperformance highlights investors  willingness to bet that tech companies will emerge stronger from the pandemic.

850,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/debt-shakeout-poised-to-make-faang-giant-retailers-even-bigger-2196247,2020-06-09,"Debt Shakeout Poised to Make FAANG, Giant Retailers Even Bigger By Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus recession is generating winners and losers in corporate America, with cash-rich behemoths set to get bigger while debt-heavy companies and the economy lag.
Slammed by the now-ending economic and social lockdown, a growing number of enterprises are filing for bankruptcy or closing up shop because they can’t pay the bills. Others are downsizing even as they pile up more I.O.U.s, adding to already record U.S. corporate debt.
The upheaval will act as a drag on growth as highly-leveraged companies are forced to divert resources from expanding their businesses to meeting creditor obligations.
“Higher debt burdens coming out of this are likely to slow recovery,” said former Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein.
The shakeout, though, will give cash-rich corporate titans an opening to grab market share and extend their dominance as the economy gradually reopens.
“The behemoths within the U.S. are going to have more market power,” Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz said.
Potential winners include the liquidity-laden FAANG stocks beloved by investors: Facebook , Amazon , Apple , Netflix  and Google-driven Alphabet . Big-box retailers Walmart  and Costco Wholesale  also could come out ahead. So, too, might retail farm-store chain Tractor Supply .
Loser Lineup
The losers already are lining up at the bankruptcy courts. Among them are such American mainstays as J.C. Penney, J. Crew Group and Hertz.
Small and medium-size businesses that operate on thin profit margins are particularly vulnerable. While many have availed themselves of help via the government’s Paycheck Protection Program, they still face daunting prospects adjusting to a world where the virus remains a threat.
“Business failures are going to be in the hundreds of thousands,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics.
Winnowing out small firms would be a plus for larger, publicly traded companies, allowing them to grab a bigger piece of the profit pie. That may be one of the reasons why the stock market has performed so well relative to the dismal performance of the economy, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase  & Co.
Unemployment unexpectedly fell last month to 13.3% from 14.7% in April but was still more than triple the level that prevailed prior to the pandemic. Among companies cutting jobs: airplane maker Boeing  and ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies .
Even before the crisis, many economists were becoming increasingly concerned about the rise of corporate leviathans that dominate industries and stifle competition.
It’s not only about tech, where Alphabet enjoys a more than 85% share of the global search-engine business. It’s also about the now-ailing airline industry (Delta, United, American), drugstore chains (CVS, Walgreens) and even the consumer product in short supply early in the crisis: toilet paper (Georgia-Pacific, Procter & Gamble,  Kimberly Clark  ).
Overall, the market share held by the top players has increased in more than 75% of U.S. industries during the past two decades, according to a 2018 paper by Rice University Professor Gustavo Grullon and fellow researchers.
That’s being blamed for a variety of economic ills. In his 2019 book “The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets,” Thomas Philippon, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, argues that a lack of competition leads to lower wages, less business investment and slower economic growth.
More concentration also means a bigger risk of supply-chain disruptions. That’s what happened in April, as the shutdown of some meatpacking plants hit by the coronavirus threatened the nation’s food supply, forcing President Donald Trump to invoke emergency powers to open them up.
Three companies --  Tyson Foods  , JBS and Cargill -- control about two-thirds of America’s beef, and the bulk of it gets processed in a few dozen giant plants. So even closing a small number of facilities was enough to call the availability of supply into question.
“The existing levels of concentration there have now been proven dangerous,” said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute think tank.
Financially Weak
Recessions historically lead to market consolidation as financially weaker firms are forced out of business. That could prove to be particularly true this time, given the unprecedented depth of the downturn and the large amount of debt many companies carried into it.
In May alone, some 28 businesses reporting at least $50 million in liabilities sought court protection from creditors. That brought the total for the first five months of the year to 99 for companies of this size -- the most for the period since 2009.
The toll might have been even greater but for the Fed’s Herculean effort to keep credit flowing to the economy via the capital markets. Through the first five months of 2020, companies issued more than $1.2 trillion in bonds, almost double the amount in the same period last year. From cruise-line operator Carnival  to car-rental company  Avis Budget   Group, many corporations were able to raise billions of dollars despite doubts about their long-term viability.
Lazard  Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Ken Jacobs does see trouble ahead for cash-strapped businesses even as economies begin to reopen.
Second Wave
“The second wave likely starts sometime this summer for the companies that don’t have enough money to make it through,” said Jacobs, whose firm is working on some of the largest company restructurings in the world.
Edward Altman said he expects a record number of mega-bankruptcies this year, surpassing the previous high of 49 in 2009 for companies with liabilities greater than $1 billion. Defaults on junk bonds also will spike, the professor emeritus at NYU’S Stern School added.
“It’s not only the impact of Covid-19, which is of course the primary reason, but also the enormous amount of debt that had been building up in the economy prior to it,” said Altman, who developed a widely used method called the Altman-Z-Score for predicting business failures.
Widespread Carnage
The carnage is likely to be more widespread among small firms that lack access to the capital markets and depend on their own resources and the banks for financing. An April survey of small businesses by a group of economists including the University of Chicago’s Marianne Bertrand found the median respondent had more than $10,000 in monthly expenses and less than one month of cash on hand.
“Market concentration should increase significantly, which undermines workers’ ability to negotiate their wages, as big companies with access to capital markets take over from the small independent shops that are getting wiped out,” said Megan Greene, a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School.
To protect themselves from takeovers, some corporations are adopting so-called poison pills, which generally allow investors to acquire additional shares if an unwanted suitor takes a significant stake in the company. That includes  Office Depot  , which last month announced plans to lay off about 13,000 employees, and Oklahoma City driller Chesapeake Energy , which Bloomberg reported is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing.
Long Odds
Progressive  Democratic lawmakers Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York also have weighed in, pushing a bill that would ban many corporate mergers while the coronavirus crisis persists. The proposal faces extremely long odds in the Republican-controlled Senate and with Trump.
Even before the crisis hit, big tech companies were facing increased scrutiny from antitrust regulators. While that could inhibit them from making overt moves toward consolidating their market power, it didn’t stop Amazon from recently looking into buying driverless-vehicle startup Zoox.
Not every economist is convinced that increased market concentration is all that bad. In a paper last year, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor David Autor and fellow researchers argued that so-called superstar firms are prospering because they’re more productive than their rivals.
No matter the reason though, the rich seem poised to get richer because of fallout from the pandemic. “There’s an accelerated shift in wealth and commerce going on from small businesses to big businesses,” former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris said.

Last month, Indonesia passed a law requiring big internet companies to pay VAT on sales of digital products and services from July, and in the Philippines a lawmaker introduced a similar bill in parliament to tax digital services. 
The Thai bill, which still has to be voted on by Thailand s parliament, requires non-resident companies or platforms that earn more than 1.8 million baht ($57,434.59) per year from providing digital services in the country to pay a 7% VAT on sales, deputy government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek told reporters.
Thailand is expected to add about 3 billion baht ($95.72 million) to its coffers annually from the move, which will affect services such as music and video streaming, gaming, and hotel booking, she added, without naming any companies. 
""These businesses would ve had to pay VAT if they had been Thai, which is unfair,"" Ratchada said. 
Thailand, Southeast Asia s second-largest economy, has mulled taxing digital businesses for years, hoping to tap the country s internet economy, one of the fastest growing in the region. 
Thanawat Malabuppha, president of the Thai e-Commerce Association, told Reuters he welcomed the move, as it will help level the playing field for rival Thai businesses. 
""Anyone who makes money from Thai people should pay taxes to the country,"" he said.
Analysts say the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated a push by governments around the world to tax internet companies, who could see a boost in revenues as people stay at home during global lockdowns.
Nearly 140 countries from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are negotiating the first major rewriting of tax rules to take better account of the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon , Facebook , Apple  and Google . 
Southeast Asian regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax tech giants more, while industry groups have warned that over-regulation could blunt the region s booming digital economy.

Dozens of countries have launched or plan contact tracing apps using either Bluetooth or location-tracking technology to notify people quickly of possible coronavirus exposure. But the first generation of contact tracing apps rushed out in March and April raised privacy alarms.
Poland s latest app comes after the country lifted some restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus and after a few days of record high new coronavirus cases mainly due to the spread among miners.
The initial version of Poland s ProteGO Safe app used Bluetooth technology to log connections between smartphones on a device. A user who got sick would change his status in the application anonymously and it would send data about his contacts within the previous two weeks to an external server to inform other users about possible risk.
But doubts over privacy security convinced Poland to join Switzerland, Latvia and Italy that opted for Bluetooth short-range radio for their apps, based on technology from Apple  and Google  that securely logs exchanges on the smartphones of people who have been near each other.
""We paid a lot of attention to ... secure privacy issues,"" Poland s digital minister Marek Zagorski told a videoconference.
""The application does not collect, process or transfer any data outside, except for the anonymous keys that are used to activate the notification module. It is completely anonymous."" 
Zagorski said the aim was to make the application interoperable with other ones in Europe and that at least 30-40% of smartphone users needed to use the app to make it work effectively. 
""So we are talking here not about thousands but about millions of users in Poland and this is our goal,"" the minister said. ""We hope that we will be able to persuade Poles to install this application in ... a dozen or so weeks so that ... we are better prepared for the second wave (of coronavirus).""
Poland has so far confirmed 27,365 coronavirus infections, while 1,172 people have died."

Investing.com - Wall Street eased off session lows on Tuesday, ahead of the Federal Reserve s two-day meeting amid growing expectations the central bank will continue to signal that rates will remain low for some time.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.89%, or 244 points, the S&P 500 slipped 0.63%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.41%.
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates steady on Wednesday, but reiterate its conviction to support the economy, with many expecting further guidance on additional stimulus measures.
At its previous meeting, the Fed recently floated the idea of using yield curve control, which allows central banks to target specific government bond yield through the purchase and sale of bonds, to help keep lending rates near zero.

Investing.com - Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq Composite briefly above 10,000 on Tuesday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke its six-day advance ahead of the Federal Reserve s interest rate announcement.
The Nasdaq settled below the psychologically significant 10,000 level, but still at another record high as giant stocks like Amazon.com  and Apple  surged. Facebook , Netflix  and Google parent Alphabet  also rose.
Investors paused after a multiday rally to await the Fed s statement, which is scheduled to be released on Wednesday. A number of economic data points also come out, including information on consumer prices and oil inventories.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Investors Await the Fed s Statement
The Federal Open Market Committee s two-day meeting ends Wednesday and investors expect the central bank to continue its support for the economy as it begins to emerge from the Covid-19 shutdowns.
Interest rates are expected to remain unchanged, but the Fed s statement could outline what it sees as risks to economic growth.
The Fed, along with the Treasury and Congress, have pumped trillions in stimulus to support businesses that were forced to shut down because of Covid-19.
2. Consumer Price Data Also Set for Release
The consumer price index data for May will be released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). The forecast is for CPI to grow 0.2% in May compared to the same month last year, but to decline 0.1% since April amid Covid shutdowns. Total consumer prices fell 0.8% in April, the sharpest drop since the end of 2008 after energy prices plummeted.

3. Weekly Oil Inventories Could Propel Oil Price
Weekly data on crude oil inventories are also due out Wednesday at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). The expectation is for a decline of 1.74 million barrels for the week ending June 5 compared to a decline of just over 2 million barrels the previous week."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Chinese video app TikTok s new Chief Executive Kevin Mayer has told EU digital chief Thierry Breton he intends to play an active role fighting disinformation, an EU official said on Tuesday, as Breton pushes tech giants to step up their efforts against fake news.
Breton in the last two months has held video conferences with Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google  CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple  CEO Tim Cook and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to promote his campaign against fake news and other issues.
TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, allows users to create short videos. It has exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 crisis but has recently been hit with privacy complaints and concerns stemming from its apparently close ties to Beijing.
Mayer, previously Walt  Disney   Co s top streaming executive, left the U.S. entertainment and theme parks giant to become TikTok s CEO last month.
""Good conversation with Kevin Mayer, CEO of TikTok. Entertaining millions, TikTok has a role to play against disinformation,"" Breton said in a tweet on Tuesday after a video call with Mayer.
Breton invited TikTok to join the European Union s code of conduct, said the EU official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Members of the voluntary code of conduct include Google, Facebook, Twitter and Mozilla which signed up in October 2018 to combat fake news on their platforms in a bid to stave off more heavy-handed regulations.
""Breton expects online platforms in general and TikTok in particular to use governance proactively to be a partner in fighting disinformation,"" the official said.

Mayer committed to acting responsibly and to address issues related to illegal and harmful content, including taking additional steps in the fight against disinformation, the official said."

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Singapore kicked off a global rush to develop contact tracing apps for the novel coronavirus when the city-state launched an apparently new system in March.
But the project actually drew inspiration from a 2014 U.S. high school project that won an international prize but found no backers - until now.
It all started when Rohan Suri created an app at Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria, Virginia, to tell his mom to leave home for the bus stop when he was seven minutes away. As the Ebola epidemic ravaged western Africa at the time, Suri and schoolmate Claire Scoggins connected the dots between tracking apps and contact tracers who ask patients whom they may have spread viruses to.
""I got really interested in basically automating a lot of these contact tracing efforts,"" Suri said, noting a staff shortage in remote parts of Africa during the Ebola epidemic.
When Suri and Scoggins developed a prototype called kTrace, they appealed to medical aid organizations and the U.S. government to bring it to the frontlines. But they found no takers, even after winning third place for systems software at the 2015 International Science and Engineering Fair.
The app languished until Suri, now a 21-year-old junior at Stanford University, got an email on Jan. 24 from Jason Bay, a Stanford alum and senior director at Singapore s Government Technology Agency (GovTech).
""My mom had texted me saying,  You ve got to look at this virus in Wuhan and do something about it, "" Suri said, referring to the city in China where the coronavirus outbreak began. ""I didn t take it seriously, though, and week later the Singapore government is reaching out.""
Bay s team had been looking for technology to help curb the coronavirus and came across kTrace online. Suri spent February and March volunteering on GovTech s TraceTogether app alongside fellow Stanford students Nikhil Cheerla and Daniel Lee.
They said they gave Singapore a roadmap by sharing kTrace s code and providing advice in virtual meetings on stronger privacy protections. They also collected 13 phones to help test Bluetooth technology.
Singapore was ""just looking around for any way to speed up the development process and we fit in,"" Cheerla said.
The agency said it contacted Suri ""to understand his experiences and considerations in designing kTrace for Android."" But Suri ""did not commit code to TraceTogether, nor did (GovTech) use kTrace in the development of TraceTogether,"" it added.
NEW PROJECT
University scientists Kate Farrahi and Manuel Cebrian said their studies as early as 2011 were the first to show Bluetooth readings could aid contact tracing. They did not develop an app, however, and Suri had not seen their work in high school.
But since Singapore s app launched, several dozen governments, including Australia, Britain and U.S. states such as North Dakota, have spent millions of dollars among them to develop separate tracing apps. Government health authorities administer and promote the apps and link them to their testing systems.
Many other governments are monitoring progress in Singapore, where about 25% of the country s 5.6 million residents have downloaded TraceTogether.
Contact tracing apps largely use anonymous Bluetooth radio exchanges to automatically log nearby users. The technology aims to slow viruses by identifying secondhand infections more quickly than through interviews.
But privacy concerns are a hurdle, and the technology does not work well on iPhones. A fix Apple Inc  introduced in partnership with Alphabet  Inc s Google last month limits the personal data contact tracing apps can collect, which authorities say reduces their effectiveness.
Singapore has adopted a costly solution: Giving residents small tracing gadgets, possibly worn on a lanyard, that do not require smartphones.
Suri said he, too, had developed a wearable device in high school because Ebola infections were highest in countries with low smartphone ownership.
Suri is now focusing on a third app called Zero, aimed at U.S. cities.
The day after TraceTogether launched, a friend who knew about Suri s involvement introduced him to a handful of New York entrepreneurs and venture capitalists seeking to bring similar technology to the United States.
They ended up co-founding Zero, which aims to attract users by bundling contact tracing technology with a safety-rating tool for shops and restaurants based on measures such as occupancy limits and mask rules.
""You need a strategy that goes hyperlocal, and that s what Zero is doing,"" Suri said.
For example, a shopper would check Zero for safety ratings before deciding where to go. Shops could promote special hours through the app for customers who wear masks.

Zero launched for iPhones last week, with its first business listings coming soon in New Rochelle, New York. Contact tracing will be added when cities agree to become partners."

The global stock market’s capitalization has climbed by roughly $22 trillion from the March low. Tallies of central bank stimulus are fraught with challenge, but  Morgan Stanley   last month predicted $13 trillion in cumulative balance-sheet expansion during the current easing cycle from the U.S., euro region, Japan and U.K. through the end of 2021.
The 40% plus rally in the MSCI  All Country World Index from its March low suggests it’s not just policy measures that have rescued investors, but expectations of a real-economy rebound. UBS Group AG  analysts say that high-frequency indicators of mobility -- such as foot traffic at retailers and metros -- support the equity surge.
The danger, though, for investors and policy makers alike is that any complication in the economic recovery could see market gains swiftly reverse -- at a time when there’s less room for additional policy support, given the scope of what’s already been deployed. And while markets will likely look through horrific second-quarter data, tolerance for depression-like numbers into the second half may be thin.
“It is prudent to expect the script on the pandemic to have a few more dark turns,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “If stock prices slump significantly again, this would be another headwind to the global economic recovery, and put even more pressure on central banks and governments.”
Familiar Movie
Of course, rallying markets are to be celebrated if the global economic outlook lives up to the optimism. And markets are supposed to price in the future -- not the past -- as evidenced with the U.S. credit-market’s unfreezing even before the Federal Reserve got its corporate-debt purchases going.
“The disconnect is a movie I have seen many times,” said Allen Sinai, a Wall Street veteran who has worked as an economist for more than four decades and heads Decision Economics, Inc. “I have seen it in every recession, every downturn. The stock market, before the end of recession, begins to go up and the next equity bull market begins.”
On Monday, the S&P 500 Index turned positive for the year on the very same day that the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the U.S. economy had officially entered recession for the first time in over a decade.
But history also features rallies that faltered, complicating the road to recovery. The S&P 500 by early January 2009 had enjoyed a 24% climb from a November 2008 low, but the financial crisis had another sting in the tail to come. The index tumbled 28% by early March 2009, keeping pressure on for stimulus.
With the lockdowns and subsequent re-openings disrupting economic patterns like never before, traders have turned to using high-frequency indicators such as location-tracking data from smartphones published by Apple Inc ., Alphabet  Inc.’s Google and Baidu Inc , as well as restaurant reservations from OpenTable Inc and traffic statistics from TomTom NV.
They all offer a gauge of whether life is returning to normal -- on the assumption that economic activity should improve as well.
“How good the information they carry will be known when we know if hard, traditional data is following the pointers we are getting,” said Binay Chandgothia, portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors. “For now, they are the only real information sources and they seem like logical datapoints.”
Betting on V
Optimists point to the shock 2.5 million increase in U.S. payrolls and decline in the unemployment rate to 13.3% as firmer evidence of a rebound.
Goldman Sachs  Inc. economists led by Jan Hatzius argue that if global GDP is now rising, the recession will be the deepest -- but also the shortest -- since World War II. Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Chetan Ahya holds a similar view, arguing that upside surprises in economic data points to a “deep V-shaped recovery.”
Stocks have moved to price that in. With corporate earnings having collapsed thanks to the lockdowns, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently sits at 25.6 times, the highest since the dotcom bubble, and far above the average of just under 17 since the start of 2000.
Investment-grade corporate bonds have also come back, with yields hitting record lows, pulled down by the powerful rally in government debt. While 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have climbed from their March lows, analysts surveyed by Bloomberg see them staying below 2% for years to come, effectively held down by the Fed and continued disinflation.
“The big hope is that this optimism, which reflects the silver lining of this historic shock, proves right,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz  SE and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. “But every element requires politicians to remain highly focused, put political polarization aside and appropriately evolve their policy approaches.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian stocks were set to fall on Thursday after gloomy economic projections from the U.S. Federal Reserve sent the greenback and most Wall Street shares lower.
Fed officials at their policy meeting on Wednesday said U.S. gross domestic product is expected to decline 6.5% this year. They also flagged the need to keep the key interest rate near zero through at least 2022.
""The Fed is basically saying they re going to keep the system solvent and at the macro level there s no room for failures but at the micro level there d be some businesses that won t survive,"" said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner at Harris Financial Group.
Australian S&P/ASX 200 futures were down 1.08%, while {{178|Japan s NiNikkei 225 futures fell 1.2%. Hong Kong s Hang Seng index futures were 0.31% lower.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones benchmarks both moved between gains and losses after the Fed statement, which was the first projections from the U.S. central bank on the economy since the coronavirus outbreak.
An S&P index of bank shares, which tend to benefit from rising rates, fell 5.8% in its biggest daily percentage decline since April 15, and the S&P 500 financial index was the biggest drag on the benchmark index.
""The broad downgrade in banking stocks came as the market wasn t sure what the extent of their loan loss provisions would be,"" Cox said.
The Nasdaq benchmark, however, continued its record-breaking rally for the third consecutive session helped by gains in shares of Microsoft  and Apple , with investors viewing technology as a defensive sector with massive growth opportunities, Cox added.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.04%, the S&P 500 lost 0.53%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.67%.

(Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday introduced a bill to provide more than $22.8 billion in aid for semiconductor manufacturers, aiming to spur the construction of chip factories in America amid a strategic technology rivalry with China.
Chip factories can cost up to $15 billion to build, with much of the expense in the form of pricey tools. The proposal would create a 40% refundable income tax credit for semiconductor equipment, $10 billion in federal funds to match state incentives to build factories, and $12 billion in research and development funding.
It would authorize the Defense Department to use funding under the Defense Production Act to ""establish and enhance a domestic semiconductor production capability."" While a network of ""trusted foundries"" exists in the United States to help supply chips to the U.S. government, many chips must still be sourced from Asia.
Senators John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, and Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, introduced the bill in the Senate. Aides to Representatives Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, and Doris Matsui, a California Democrat, said the two planned to introduce a version in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday.
While some U.S. firms such as  Intel Corp   and Micron Technology Inc  still make chips in the United States, the industry s center of gravity has shifted to Asia, where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has more than half of the overall market for contract manufacturing chips and an even stronger hold on the most advanced chips.
Firms, including iPhone maker Apple Inc , Qualcomm  Inc and Nvidia  Corp all rely on TSMC and other Asian foundries to manufacture their chips.
The dual shocks of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted chip supply chains, and Beijing s  move to strengthen its control over Hong Kong have prompted alarm in Washington over having advanced chip manufacturing concentrated in Taiwan, a U.S. ally across a narrow strait from China, which has spent billions of dollars bolstering its domestic chip manufacturing industry.
TSMC last month said it plans to build a factory in Arizona."

In a message on Twitter https://twitter.com/pocketcasts/status/1270875436671614976, Pocket Casts said that its app ""has been removed ... by Apple at the request of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)"".
""We were contacted by the CAC through Apple around two days before the app was removed from the store,"" Pocket Casts said on Twitter."

Investing.com - Stocks on Wall Street have mostly struggled this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 benchmarks both pulling back after their recent strong gains.
 
In a reality check to the stock market s recent euphoria, the Federal Reserve predicted the U.S. economy would shrink 6.5% in 2020 and unemployment would still be at 9.3% at year s end.
 
The Nasdaq Composite, however, managed to hold on to a good chunk of its rally after registering a closing record high above the 10,000-level for the first time in history on Wednesday.
 
 
 
Leading up to Thursday’s session, the tech-heavy index has reached new all-time highs each day this week, as investors bet on the sector’s strength amid the economic reopening.
 
The index has now rallied nearly 50% from an intraday low set on March 23, when coronavirus-related lockdowns shocked the stock market.
 
 
 
The Nasdaq s upbeat performance has come on the back of strong gains in many of the big-name tech-related shares, most notably Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , and Facebook .
 
All four companies have seen their shares hit all-time highs this week.
 
The combined market value of the four companies is now more than $5 trillion, with Apple claiming the top spot at nearly $1.53 trillion, followed by Microsoft at $1.49 trillion and Amazon at $1.32 trillion.
 
At $674 billion, Facebook is the only one of the group with a market cap below $1 trillion.
 
Google-parent Alphabet  is the only one of the five largest tech stocks not to close at an all-time high. It’s still about 5% behind its all-time high of $1,524.87, where it closed on Feb. 19.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China s Xiaomi  Corp and Oppo are importing some smartphone models into India as their local plants struggle to get back to production levels needed to meet demand that built up during lockdown, sources familiar with matter said.
The move is a costly one as the world s second-largest smartphone market imposes steep tariffs on imports of devices and components - part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi s push to boost manufacturing in India. Most foreign brands in India make nearly all of their smartphones locally.
It also underscores the challenges India faces in kick-starting production as new coronavirus cases soar to nearly 300,000 while more than 8,000 people have died.
Manufacturing facilities in India have been allowed since May to resume operations but several smartphone plants are still grappling with labour shortages, three sources told Reuters.
At the same time, demand is high because phones - not deemed essential goods by the government - were not allowed to be sold during the nationwide lockdown of nearly two months.
The bulk of the Xiaomi smartphones sold in India are made by contract manufacturer Foxconn in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, while Oppo assembles its India-made phones at a plant on the outskirts of New Delhi.
It was not immediately clear how many phones the Chinese brands are now importing, the sources added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the matter with media.
""This is purely to take care of the demand that is there and the fact that they (Xiaomi) are not able to produce to meet demand,"" one of the sources said, adding the imports were a short-term measure until production and distribution gets back to normal.
Xiaomi did not respond to a request for comment and Foxconn declined to comment.
Oppo s plant, which also makes phones for the OnePlus and Realme brands owned by common parent BBK Electronics, reopened with reduced staffing on May 7. But it had to close again for more than a week after several workers tested positive for the coronavirus. 
In a few instances, staff at Oppo and other smartphone plants have either resigned or not shown up for work for fear of contracting the virus on assembly lines where people work closely, sources said.
""My father said if you live, you ll find another job,"" one worker who recently resigned from the Oppo factory told Reuters, asking not to be named.
Oppo India declined to comment.
The production woes have meant delays to sales plans.
OnePlus, which competes with Apple Inc  in India s $400-plus smartphone segment, has had to stagger sales of its latest model on Amazon  s India website.
Realme said in an emailed statement it has been challenging to meet market demand due to supply chain disruptions and ""limited production capabilities"".

It added it would not risk the health of factory workers by ramping up production quickly and that it expected to be at normal manufacturing capacity by the end of July."

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve was pretty downbeat in its assessment of the U.S. economy, and this may increase fears of deflation going forward. The stock market is set to weaken as a result, while crude also heads lower amid fears of a supply glut. All this while concerns are growing about a second wave of the Covid-19 virus. At least initial jobless claims are likely to show an improvement in the employment market, admittedly from a low base. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, June 11th.
1. Fed offers up gloomy outlook; Deflation now a worry?
The Federal Open Market Committee kept rates unchanged Wednesday, with the fed funds range at 0-0.25%, and reiterated its  commitment to maintaining easy monetary policy measures for some time.
""The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said.
This looks like being a long time - just two out of 17 FOMC members expect to see a rate rise before the end of 2022.
The Fed stated that the economy is expected to contract by 6.5% in 2020, and the unemployment rate for the year is expected to come in at 9.3%.
However, it’s the pace of inflation which is likely to be the key driver for future monetary policy, and this was forecast to cool to a rate of 0.8%, down from 1.9% previously. 
In the press conference, Fed chief Jerome Powell “mentioned a weak inflation pressure, however, he did not sound overly concerned,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “We, on the other hand, see deflation risks as high and have been flagging it for a while.”
This followed the core Consumer Price Index turning negative Wednesday. It also declined for the third consecutive month, which has never happened before.
The Producer Price Index for May is due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), and will no doubt be watched closely. It measures the change in the price of goods sold by manufacturers and is a leading indicator of consumer price inflation. 
Analysts estimate the PPI will rise 0.1% for the month of May, a reversal of the 1.3% decline the previous month.
2. Fears of a second coronavirus wave across the U.S.
Fears are starting to grow that the prompt reopening of many states across the U.S. will result in a second wave of infections from the Covid-19 virus, likely causing even more economic damage to a country already in an exceedingly deep recession with millions unemployed.
A few days ago top World Health Organisation official Dr. Hans Kluge warned that the pandemic was not over, and now was the ""time for preparation, not celebration.""
With this mind, Bloomberg reported that Texas had registered 2,504 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, the highest one-day total since the pandemic emerged. Florida also noted 8,553 new cases this week, the most of any seven-day period, while California’s hospitalizations are at their highest since May 13 and have risen in nine of the past 10 days.
“There is a new wave coming in parts of the country,” said Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It’s small and it’s distant so far, but it’s coming.”
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned only Wednesday that global growth will contract by 7.6% in 2020 if there is a second wave of Covid-19 infections, a bigger hit than the drop of 6% it predicted without a new wave.
3. Weekly jobless claims due
The go-to data to measure the state of the U.S. employment market will be released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), and initial jobless claims are estimated to be 1.55 million for the week, down from 1.87 million the prior week, as the overall trend on jobs continues to improve with the reopening of businesses.
Unemployment is still above 13%, according to the government s most recent report, the highest since the post-World War II era. Continuing jobless claims are estimated to come in near 20 million, down from 21.5 million the previous week.
The reopening of the U.S. economy is clearly having a positive effect, but there is a very long way to go.  Without an acceleration of hiring it would take another seven months to fully replace the April payroll at the May hiring rate. 
4. Stocks set to open lower; Tech in focus
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower following the downbeat comments from the Federal Reserve Wednesday, with not even the dominant tech sector able to prevent a sharp sea of red.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was down 496 points or 1.8%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 1.1% lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 had ended a choppy session lower on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq Composite closed above the 10,000 level for the first time, underscoring the rebound in technology-related stocks following the coronavirus rout.
At the forefront of this strength has been Apple , with the tech giant this week becoming the first US company to achieve a $1.5 trillion market capitalization.
The tech sector will remain in focus Thursday, as graphics software maker Adobe  reports earnings. Wall Street is awaiting Adobe s comments on how the Covid-19 pandemic and related business shutdowns affected its cloud computing business, something management warned about in their prior quarter earnings.
5. Crude inventories point to supply glut
Crude oil prices continued to push lower Thursday, as an increase in American crude stockpiles late Wednesday to a record high raised fresh concerns about a potential supply glut, just as the Federal Reserve was cautioning about longer-lasting damage on the economy from the coronavirus.
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories grew by 5.72 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. This was very different from the small stock drawdown the market was expecting, but backed up the previous day s report  from the American Petroleum Institute.
“This increase now sees total U.S. commercial crude oil inventories stand at 538 million barrels, surpassing the levels seen back in early 2017, and in fact the highest level going as far back as 1982,” analysts at ING wrote, in a research note.
Global production cuts and the easing of lockdowns in some countries had pushed prices higher after the historic drop below zero in April. But, there are concerns U.S. producers may pump more with crude above $30 a barrel, adding to a glut.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 2.8% at $38.48 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was 2.7% lower at $40.62 a barrel."

ROME (Reuters) - Italy, the first major European country to roll out a smartphone app to trace COVID-19 infections that does not rely on a centralized database, has already seen 2.2 million downloads in 10 days, a sign Italians are setting aside privacy concerns.
The government, like those of other European countries hit by the virus, is touting the software as a vital tool to help avoid a second wave of infections. Germany launches its own version next week.
""We want a summer in which tourism is as safe as possible. This app can help us resume activities after the lockdown,"" Technological Innovation and Digitalization Minister Paola Pisano told Reuters.
Italy was the first European country to be hit hard by the coronavirus and has suffered more than 34,000 deaths. A lockdown drove infection rates sharply lower, but fears remain of a renewed flare-up later this year.
The government s call for a tracing app originally met resistance from privacy advocates and opposition politicians, but many Italians are warming to it.
""Even my in-laws downloaded it,"" said Daniela Camozzi, 47, in Sarzana, a town in the northern Liguria region, one of the first parts of the country where the app went live.
""I don t get all this concern about privacy. Every time we use our smartphone our data is profiled much more massively than this app can.""
The app has so far been switched on in just four regions, accounting for 8 million of Italy s 60 million people. The authorities hope to sustain the enthusiasm when it has its countrywide launch later this month.
Called Immuni (immune), the app uses Bluetooth short-range radio based on a joint technology standard from Apple  and Google  to log close contacts securely on the device. It was developed by a Milan tech start-up, Bending Spoons.
In the case of a positive coronavirus test, the doctor uploads the result anonymously onto a server, and a notification is sent to people the holder has encountered. It advises them to call a doctor, self isolate and seek a test.
Italy s adoption of this  decentralized  approach is in line with a growing number of European countries, including Switzerland, Germany and Austria. Their common approach could later support a  roaming  function for foreign travel.
France, meanwhile, launched an app last week that stores data on a central server - an approach which is not supported by Apple on privacy grounds and works poorly on iPhones.
Stefano Denicolai, a member of Italy s COVID-19 task force, said Immuni could help break chains of infection if 25% of Italians download it, provided they are concentrated in key locations and social sectors of the population.

It remains to be seen if the app s early popularity will be sustained as it is rolled out more widely. Right-wing opposition leader Matteo Salvini is still withholding support: ""Until there is a total guarantee on privacy protection I won t download anything at all,"" he said."

BEIJING (Reuters) -  Zoom Video Communications   has gained a following in China in recent months from users ranging from underground churches to feminists who saw it as a rare way to connect with the world beyond the reach of state censors.
Some fear that window may be closing.
On Friday, Zoom said it had suspended accounts of three U.S. and Hong Kong activists at Beijing s request after they tried to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square  crackdown, but that they had since been reactivated. The U.S. company also said it was developing technology to enable it to remove or block participants based on geography.
The Chinese government heavily regulates the internet, in a system widely dubbed the Great Firewall, saying this is needed to maintain social stability. All Chinese social media platforms are required to censor public posts deemed illegal.
""For us, the biggest challenge has been how to reach people within China because of the firewall, and Zoom for a while looked like a ray of hope,"" said U.S.-based Humanitarian China founder Zhou Fengsuo, whose account was suspended.
The conferencing tool, originally designed for business use, saw Chinese user numbers surge in tandem with its global popularity amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a rare feat given how Western peers such as WhatsApp, Google  Meet and Facebook  are blocked in China s cyberspace. 
Zoom s mobile app has been downloaded 5.4 million times from Apple  s China store since Jan. 1, 11 times the number over the same period in 2019, according to research firm SensorTower.
While most Chinese users turn to Zoom for conference calls and casual chats, some have seized the chance to discuss potentially sensitive topics, from patriotism to feminism.
Some state-approved and underground churches use Zoom to hold services.
""Zoom is not the only software, but we feel it s rather more accessible,"" said Xiao Meili, a feminist activist who held a Zoom talk in April on the #MeToo movement. 
""Before, some friends recommended Tencent conference ... but everyone would feel like you shouldn t say anything that s slightly sensitive,"" she said, referring to a tool offered by the Chinese tech giant behind WeChat. 
INSIDE THE FIREWALL
In March, Youth Lectures kicked off a series of Zoom talks, the first of which was led by Chinese University of Hong Kong professor Chow Po Chung, on freedom of speech in China. Chow s mainland China account on the Twitter-like platform Weibo  has been deleted multiple times. 
Other anonymous groups hosted lectures from a #MeToo activist and a gender-activist on their work in mid-May.
New York-based Lu Pin, whose influential Feminist Voices accounts on Weibo and WeChat were shut by authorities in 2018, said Zoom was a way to connect a Chinese audience to the outside world.
""You don t have to climb the firewall, people in China and outside of China both can connect to it,"" she said.
There are few alternatives, she said.
""This is not a multiple-choice question. If you re a Chinese person, if you don t use this, what will you use?""

Zoom s China users had already been subject to new constraints since last month when the company announced that free users would no longer be able host meetings, and new registrations were limited to some enterprises."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan aims to launch a smartphone app based on technology from Apple Inc  and Alphabet Inc s  Google next week to help curb the spread of coronavirus by tracking close contact with those infected, the health ministry said on Friday.
Smartphones with the app installed can detect each other via Bluetooth short-range wireless and log those who have come in close contact. 
If a phone user is found to be infected, people who spent more than 15 minutes within a radius of one meter (3.3 feet) of that individual sometime over the previous 14 days will be notified that they were in close contact with a coronavirus-infected person, and be prompted to seek medical consultation. 
Such a message will be sent only if the infected individual gives consent, and the person with a positive diagnosis will remain anonymous to the receivers of the notification.
""By knowing the possibility of having come into contact with someone tested positive for the new coronavirus, (app) users can get early support from a public health center such as an access to a diagnostic test,"" a health ministry statement said.
""We expect an increase in the number of users will help prevent the spread of infection.""
Dozens of countries have launched or plan contact tracing apps to notify people quickly of possible coronavirus exposure as they look to reopen their economies, although such methods have fueled privacy concerns.
To give smartphone users privacy protection, the app Japan will be launching does not collect names, phone numbers, user location and other personal information, the ministry said. 
Japan has not suffered the explosive surge of coronavirus infections seen in some other countries. It has reported about 17,300 confirmed cases and 922 known deaths to date. "
875,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stock-pickers-are-failing-to-beat-the-whiplashed-pandemic-market-2200709,2020-06-12,Stock Pickers Are Failing to Beat the Whiplashed Pandemic Market By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Stock pickers are getting schooled on just how hard it is to outsmart this pandemic-driven market.
After the S&P 500’s biggest plunge since the March madness on Thursday, expectations are rising that shares will move in lockstep again, a headwind for stock pickers looking to divine winners and losers. Add the fact that fewer companies are leading market gains this week, and it’s looking like a tough summer for those who pick securities for a living.
Active managers are coming off a dispiriting stretch. More than 60% of domestic equity funds underperformed the S&P Composite 1500 in the first four months of 2020, according to data this week from S&P Dow Jones Indices. That means investors largely failed to prove their mettle during the most extreme price swings in modern history.
After finding reason for cheer in calmer trading conditions just weeks ago, the question is whether active managers can find overlooked stars and discover securities that sway to their own beat.
“The intra-sectoral correlation is very high again,” said Roger Jones, head of equities at London and Capital Asset Management Ltd. “This normally happens when volatility picks up, when markets are driven more by the top-down than the bottom-up.”
The benchmark U.S. stock gauge pared the early advance in Friday trading, while Wall Street frets a second virus wave and a rally that’s defied the economic downturn.
Anyone with stock-picking smarts has been grappling with virus headlines in a macro-driven market for months now, but lately there’s been reason for optimism. As early as Monday, correlations had dropped to levels last seen before the sell-off, and beaten-up shares were in the midst of a historic comeback. Money was rushing in to chase the rebound as major economies gradually re-opened and U.S. jobs data unexpectedly improved.
Yet on Thursday, pros who had been sounding the alarm over elevated valuations looked prescient, as shares slumped after the Federal Reserve warned of a long path to recovery and infection rates ticked up in parts of the U.S.
The implied correlation of S&P companies spiked to the highest in more than two months, while an equal-weighted version of the index looks set for its second-worst week versus the regular capitalization-weighted version in data going back three decades.
Meanwhile the outlook for small caps looks grim after economic shutdowns across the world. The Russell 2000 Index of small caps is set for its worst week versus the S&P 500 since April.
That’s a problem for active managers who are known to overweight the cohort. The correlation between the outperformance of small caps and the excess returns of active managers has only risen further since the global financial crisis, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein.
“Given the unprecedentedly abrupt nature of the drop in revenues, it is likely that more small caps will not survive than would be the case in a ‘normal’ recession,” the Bernstein analysts wrote. “The skew to mega cap returns means that managers need to be ever more concentrated in order to outperform.”
The dominance of mega caps is another fly in the ointment. As their stellar returns make the market more concentrated -- just pull up a chart of Amazon.com Inc . or Apple Inc . for evidence -- it’s become hard for stock pickers to have sufficiently large wagers to beat their benchmarks, strategists Alla Harmsworth and Harjaspreet Mand suggested in a note last Friday.
Another challenge for active managers lurks in the underbelly of the stock market beloved by quants.
Factors -- the characteristics of shares tracked by systematic funds -- are driving the largest portion of the S&P 500’s returns in about a decade, Evercore ISI’s calculations show. That suggests that a fund manager picking stocks by slicing and dicing the corporate earnings trends might find their skills overwhelmed by broader forces like a global rush for havens.
Of course, individual managers correctly positioned for market turns have notched stellar returns from the turmoil. And one bull case holds that as easing credit stresses alleviate immediate anxiety over bankruptcies, investors can re-focus on the basics of stock-picking.
Over at London and Capital, Jones’s team tries to take advantage of sell-offs by scooping up stocks with longer-term appeal. But when it comes to a once-in-a-generation pandemic, some humility is in order.
“What confidence do I have in my views? It’s probably not great in terms of all the moving parts in the economy,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Zoom Video Communications  , whose remote meeting app made the obscure California company a hub for global communications during the coronavirus pandemic, now finds itself fighting political battles in Washington and Beijing.
Even before Zoom ran into criticism from U.S. lawmakers about its relations with China this week, it had prepared itself for political problems. The California-based company recently brought on board several lobbyists, including a former Trump campaign official, and added a former White House official to its board.
This month, Zoom suspended accounts of three U.S. and Hong Kong activists at Beijing s request after they tried to commemorate the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square  crackdown. Then on Thursday, three U.S. lawmakers asked Zoom to clarify its data-collection practices and relationship with the Chinese government.
""To be clear, their accounts have been reinstated, and going forward, we will have a new process for handling similar situations,"" Zoom said Thursday. 
Zoom s mobile app has been downloaded 5.4 million times from Apple  s China store since Jan. 1, 11 times the number over the same period in 2019, according to research firm SensorTower.
Earlier this spring, Zoom fielded complaints about ""zoombombing,"" where people would inject hate speech and racist slurs into class meetings and other gatherings.
In May, Zoom said it hired David Urban of the American Continental Group, who headed President Donald Trump s successful Pennsylvania campaign and is on the Trump 2020 Advisory Committee. Zoom also added Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, a former Trump national security adviser, to its board.
In April Zoom said it had hired the lobbying firm Mehlman Castagnetti, Rosen and Thomas. Zoom also hired the Cohen Group, a company spokesman said.
ACG and Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. Mehlman Castagnetti declined comment.

Asked about the letters from lawmakers, Zoom said: ""“We appreciate the outreach we have received from various elected officials and look forward to engaging with them.”"

Investing.com - Stocks rallied on Friday in volatile trading as Wall Street clawed back some of the sharp losses from the previous session.
The major averages, however, suffered their worst week since March as traders grew nervous of a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.
 
Despite that, the Nasdaq Composite has managed to rally nearly 45% from an intraday low set on March 23.
 
The tech-heavy index set a new all-time high above the 10,000-level on Wednesday.

By Reuters,"(Reuters) - The corporate response to a wave of protests over the treatment of African Americans has included pledges to increase diversity, donations to civil rights groups and, in some cases, changes in policies or practices long sought by critics. Here is a sampling:
 Starbucks Corp   said on June 12 it would allow employees to wear Black Lives Matter t-shirts and pins, rolling back restrictions on how baristas could show support for the social movement against racism.   
Apple Inc  said on June 11 the iPhone maker will increase spending with black-owned suppliers as part of a $100 million racial equity and justice initiative, while Google  s YouTube video service said it will spend $100 million to fund black content creators. 
Walmart  Inc said on June 10 it would no longer keep ""multicultural hair and beauty products"" in locked display cases at any of its stores. Critics had said doing so suggested consumers of those products are more likely to shoplift. 
NASCAR on June 10 banned the Confederate flag at all its car racing tracks and events, saying the symbol of white segregationists ""runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans"". 
Amazon.com Inc  on June 10 imposed a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition product, Rekognition, which critics say is more likely to misidentify people with darker skin and more likely to be used in minority communities. 
Jack Dorsey, the CEO of  Twitter Inc   and  Square Inc  , announced on June 9 that June 19, or Juneteenth, would become a paid company-wide holiday every year for employees of both companies. The date commemorates the June 19, 1865 reading in Texas of President Abraham Lincoln s Emancipation Declaration, which brought an end to slavery in the United States.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany on Tuesday becomes the latest European country to launch a smartphone app that seeks to break the chain of coronavirus infection by tracking encounters between people and issuing a warning should one of them test positive.
A growing number of countries in the region have opted to use Bluetooth short-range radio to measure the risk of exposure, after concluding that tracking people s movements using location data would be intrusive.
European Union member states hope soon to agree a common approach for an international  roaming  feature that could help revive travel and tourism.
WHAT S THE STORY SO FAR?
Since there is no cure for COVID-19, governments have turned to technology to create a sort of digital  herd immunity  against the flu-like disease.
After initial efforts misfired, Apple  and Alphabet s Google  - whose iOS and Android operating systems run 99% of the world s smartphones - developed a standard that logs contacts securely on devices.
Germany joins a growing list of European countries - led by Switzerland, Italy, Poland and Latvia - to create Bluetooth apps based on this decentralized approach.
HOW DOES THE GERMAN APP WORK?
Germany s Covid-Warn-App, developed by SAP  and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), will be available for download on Monday night from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
Once the app is installed it will typically show a  green , or safe, status.
Should the user spend more than 15 minutes within two meters of another app holder who later tests positive for COVID-19, they would receive a notification advising them to seek medical advice.
WHAT ARE THE SECURITY FEATURES?
The Bluetooth exchanges logged securely on devices are encrypted and pseudonyms are used, so the identity of the other person is not known.
In another security feature, positive test results would be uploaded by the German app using a QR code from the lab.
Other phones scan the system and, if one finds a so-called infected key in its log, the holder receives an exposure notification. No data is stored centrally, making it impossible to reconstruct an individual s relationships.
SOUNDS COMPLICATED - WILL IT WORK?
The design of Bluetooth-based apps represents a trade-off between usefulness and privacy. It is not possible, for example, to pinpoint the exact time and place of risk events from the app alone.
Protecting privacy, though, is a key selling point for the German app, which is voluntary and will need to be adopted by a large share of the population to be useful.
Norway on Monday halted its COVID-19 app after the country s data protection watchdog objected to the app s collection of location data as disproportionate to the task, and called for a Bluetooth-only approach.
Germany s app is intended to complement, not replace, existing contact tracing efforts that rely on interviewing people who fall ill with COVID-19 and calling people they have met.
Where the app can come in useful is in public settings - such as a train trip or bus ride - where people don t know each other. Its speed is also a plus as COVID-19 can be spread by people who have yet to develop symptoms.
WHAT ABOUT FOREIGN TRAVEL?
Although the apps are national, the idea is that they should be able to  talk  to each other. Such interoperability would make it possible to monitor infection risks when people travel between countries.

EU member states have already agreed on broad guidelines for interoperability, and are close to backing the creation of a central gateway to handle data traffic between the apps based on the Google-Apple standard, sources say."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Monday released the results of a study that found its App Store spurred $458 billion in sales last year from categories such as retail of physical goods, ride-hailing and advertising from which the iPhone maker takes no commission.
The study, backed by Apple, marks the first time the company has sought to quantify App Store activity that does not produce a commission for Apple. Commissions from the App Store, which is the only way developers can distribute apps to iPhones owned by consumers, have become a key sales driver for Apple as iPhone sales level off.
But Apple s study suggested the App Store has a broader impact. The App Store generated $519 billion in billings and sales in 2019, according to the study, conducted by economic research consulting firm Analysis Group. Of that amount, $413 billion was from physical goods and services. 
The study found $45 billion came from in-app advertising. The remaining 15% of overall App Store activity - about $63 billion - came from digital goods and services such as music and video subscriptions or in-app purchases in games.
Apple takes a commission of between 15% and 30% for digital goods and services purchased through the App Store. That practice has drawn antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, with rivals such as Spotify  Technology Ltd saying the practice hurts their business. 
To avoid paying Apple s commissions, rivals like Spotify must ask their customers to sign up for subscriptions on their own website, which adds multiple extra steps compared with paying inside the App Store. Spotify has alleged that created an uneven playing field.
In a conference call with journalists, Apple representatives said the company commissioned the study to gain a better understanding of the physical goods and services activity in its App Store. 
General retail apps on iPhones and iPads, including Amazon.com , generated an estimated $268 billion in sales and billings, followed by travel apps at $57 billion and ride-hailing apps at $40 billion.

The company s attorney sent a letter to members of the House Judiciary Committee, saying Amazon had cooperated with the probe. ""This includes making Jeff Bezos available to testify at a hearing with the other CEOs this summer,"" said the letter from Robert Kelner of Covington and Burling LLP.
The big four tech platforms - Alphabet  Inc s Google, Apple Inc , Amazon and  Facebook Inc   - are under investigation by a House Judiciary Committee panel and the U.S. Justice Department. The Federal Trade Commission is probing Facebook and Amazon and U.S. state attorneys general are looking at Facebook and Google.
Representative David Cicilline, chair of the committee s antitrust panel, said testimony from the CEOs was ""essential to complete this bipartisan investigation into the state of competition in the digital marketplace.""
""The Antitrust Subcommittee will continue to use the tools at our disposal to ensure we gather whatever information is necessary,"" he said in a statement.
Kelner s letter said that Amazon and the committee would need to ""resolve a number of questions regarding timing, format, and outstanding document production issues, all necessarily framed by the extraordinary demands of the global pandemic.""
This would be the first time that Bezos has appeared before Congress, according to a source familiar with the company.
In early May, the committee demanded Bezos  testimony in the wake of a report that the online retailer uses data from third-party sellers to create competing products. Amazon s associate general counsel, Nate Sutton, had denied under oath last July that Amazon used sensitive information from independent sellers to develop Amazon products.

The letter also noted that Amazon had given the committee s antitrust panel more than 225,000 pages of documents and notes that the committee has not given a ""binding commitment"" that they would be confidential."

In an announcement coinciding with the launch of Germany s app, the Brussels-based executive said it will be responsible for managing a central gateway for national apps to  talk  to each other.
""As we approach the travel season, it is important to ensure that Europeans can use the app from their own country wherever they are traveling in the EU,"" Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a statement.
""Contact tracing apps can be useful to limit the spread of coronavirus, especially as part of national strategies to lift confinement measures,"" he added.
Germany, Italy, Poland and Latvia have launched Bluetooth-based apps using technology from Apple  and Alphabet  s Google that logs contacts on the device, an approach backed by a majority of the EU s 27 member states.

Achieving practical interoperability for such  decentralized  apps is weeks away, according to sources involved in discussions on the matter, which would make it possible to trace infection risks across borders."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, continuing Monday’s late bounce amid hopes U.S. authorities will continue to offer stimulus to support the economy.
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 39 points, or 1.3%, higher, Nasdaq 100 Futures up 115 points, or 1.2%. The Dow Futures contract rose 478 points, or 1.9%. 
The U.S. central bank said late Monday it will soon start purchasing individual corporate debt, in another effort to support the credit market as part of its emergency facilities introduced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
This helped Wall Street close higher, reversing hefty earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.6%, or 157 points, after falling more than 300 points at the open. The S&P 500 gained 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.4%.
Adding additional support Tuesday is a report that the Trump administration is preparing a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure proposal in order to support the world’s largest economy.
This news has outweighed worries of a second wave of the Covid-19 virus, with several states including Texas and California reporting a resurgence of new cases.
Focus will soon turn to Fed chair Jerome Powell as he  testifies in front of the Senate on his economic outlook and recent monetary policy decisions, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Last week, the Fed left interest rates unchanged near zero and said the central bank would do anything needed to support the economy as it struggles to recover from Covid-19 business shutdowns. 
Ahead of Powell’s appearance there will be the release of the April retail sales numbers, at 8:30 AM ET. These are expected to show a strong rebound, up 8%, after a decline of 16.4% in the prior month.
The retail sales data will be followed by industrial production and manufacturing output figures at 9:15 AM.
In corporate news, Oracle  is out with earnings after the market close. The tech giant is one of the first to report a full quarter that was nearly all consumed by Covid-19 business shutdowns.
Also in the spotlight is Apple . EU antitrust authorities have launched two probes into whether it violated competition laws through its Apple Pay service and its App Store for software that runs on its mobile devices.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by the International Energy Agency s upward revision to its forecasts for global oil demand this year and next. The IEA still expects demand to contract on average by over 8 million barrels a day this year, however.
U.S. crude prices rose 1.6% to $37.70 a barrel, while Brent Futures climbed 1.7% to $40.40.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,736.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1319, down 0.1%."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple  on Tuesday found itself the target of two EU antitrust investigations into its App Store and Apple Pay as the bloc turned up the heat on online gatekeepers over alleged anti-competitive business practices aimed at blocking rivals.
The European Commission said one investigation would look into the mandatory use of Apple s proprietary in-app purchase system and rules preventing app developers from informing iPhone and iPad users of cheaper options elsewhere.
The case followed a complaint from Swedish music streaming service Spotify  last year, which said Apple was unfairly restricting rivals to its own music steaming service Apple Music. Another gripe was the 30% fee levied on app developers.
Spotify welcomed the EU probe, saying it hoped regulators would treat the case with urgency. A smaller rival filed a similar grievance related to e-books and audiobooks in March this year.
""It appears that Apple obtained a  gatekeeper  role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple s popular devices,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The second case focuses on Apple s terms and conditions on how its mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants  apps and websites, and also the company s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system.
Regulators are also concerned that Apple Pay, launched in 2014 as the company diversified from sales of devices like iPhones and iPads, is the only mobile payment service allowed to use the ""tap and go"" functionality on iPhones.
Apple was critical of the EU investigations.
""It s disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don t want to play by the same rules as everyone else,"" the iPhone maker said in a statement.
""We don t think that s right — we want to maintain a level playing field where anyone with determination and a great idea can succeed.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators will decide by July 20 whether to clear Alphabet  Inc-owned Google s $2.1 billion bid for fitness trackers company Fitbit , a deal that has prompted concerns from consumer groups and privacy advocates.
Google sought EU approval on Monday, according to a filing on the European Commission website.
The EU competition enforcer can either clear the deal with or without concessions or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.
The acquisition would help Google compete with Apple  and Samsung (KS:005930) in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches. Other players are Huawei [HWT.UL] and Xiaomi .
While privacy concerns are not part of the EU antitrust review, the trove of health data generated from Fitbit devices used to monitor users  daily steps, calories burned and distance travelled and how Google plans to use it is expected to be a focus.

European consumer group BEUC has called the deal a game-changer in the health and digital markets."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany appealed to the public on Tuesday to download a new smartphone app to help break the chain of coronavirus infections, one of several such apps that European governments hope will revive travel and tourism safely.
The Corona-Warn-App, now available for Apple  and Android devices, uses Bluetooth short-range radio to measure close contacts between people and issues a warning should one of them later test positive for COVID-19.
""This app isn t a cure-all. It s not a free pass. But it s an important additional tool for containing the pandemic,"" Health Minister Jens Spahn told a launch event.
Germany joins Italy, Poland and Latvia in launching apps based on technology from Apple and Alphabet  s Google that preserves privacy by logging Bluetooth contacts securely on devices.
In news coinciding with the German launch, European Union members agreed technical standards for national apps to  talk  to each other - a step towards making it possible to trace infections across borders.
""As we approach the travel season, it is important to ensure that Europeans can use the app from their own country wherever they are travelling in the EU,"" Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a statement.
SECOND TIME LUCKY
The German app nearly went off the rails in April as Berlin abandoned an initial approach that would have stored data on a central server - which privacy experts said could allow people s relationships to be spied on.
The government drafted in Deutsche Telekom  and SAP to salvage the project quickly. Initial downloads from the Google Play Store ran into the hundreds of thousands, Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges said.
Public enthusiasm for the app has been mixed - last week s Politbarometer opinion poll for ZDF found that 42% of people would download it and 46% would not, while 8% didn t have a new enough smartphone.
""I m doing my part,"" YouTuber Mori said on his Twitter feed, posting a screenshot of the app. Some others grumbled that they needed to upgrade the operating system on their iPhones before they could download the app.
Although the proximity-tracing technology is new and untested, the 20 million euro ($23 million) cost of developing the Corona-Warn-App pales by comparison with multi-billion-euro fiscal stimulus measures and corporate bailouts.
That makes it a relatively cheap bet on supporting the existing system of testing and contact tracing that has already contained the pandemic in Europe s largest economy. Germany reported just 378 COVID-19 cases and nine fatalities on Tuesday.
""It s easier to keep infections low than to beat them down from a high level,"" said Chancellery Minister Helge Braun. ""The app makes sense from Day 1.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened sharply higher on Tuesday after a big rebound in retail sales in May revived optimism in a rapid,  V-shaped  recovery for the economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The optimism was only slightly tempered by news that industrial production rebounded less in May from its collapse in April than economists had expected.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 761 points or 3.0% at 26,524 points, while the S&P 500 was up 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.3%.
Retail sales surged a record 17.7% in a month in which most states began to lift their lockdown measures, while core retail sales rose by an equally impressive 12.4%. Both figures were well ahead of consensus forecasts, albeit sales were still over 8% below pre-pandemic levels, Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco said via Twitter.
U.S. factories were less buoyant than consumers in May, however, with industrial production rising only 1.4% instead of the 2.9% expected. Moreover, data for April were revised lower to show an even sharper decline in industrial and manufacturing production than first thought. 
That wasn t enough to scare off buyers who had already been encouraged by signs of fresh stimulus from the Federal Reserve on Monday. The Fed will start buying the bonds of individual companies, fleshing out its support for the corporate credit market that it had outlined in March. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to start his semi-annual Congressional testimony at 10 AM ET.
Pharma giant Eli Lilly  shone with a 12% increase on the back of clinical trial data suggesting its breast cancer drug could find broader applications.
Cyclical and travel stocks again received most of the uplift from the data. Norwegian Cruise Line  stock rose 8.6% and rival Carnival s  stock rose 8.4%. Both companies recently undertook capital increases to stave off short-term debt concerns. Airline stocks were also back in fashion, with Spirit Airlines   stock rising 8.9%, American Airlines  rising 6.5% and United Airlines  rising 6.3%. 
Tech stocks, which have kept their valuations better than old-economy stocks during the pandemic, also rose, though not as sharply. Amazon.com  stock rose 1.7% to within touching distance of a new all-time high, while Apple  stock rose 2.8%, shrugging off news of two new EU antitrust investigations against it.  
Oil and gas stocks also rose on hopes that the recovery will be strong enough to underpin a sustained rebound in U.S. demand. Occidental Petroleum  stock rose 9.1%, while U.S. Crude futures rose 5.0% to $38.97 after the International Energy Agency raised its demand forecasts for 2020 and 2021."

PARIS (Reuters) - A coronavirus contact tracing app being introduced in France may not be able to connect with others across the European Union because it stores data centrally, EU Commission vice-president Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday.
The EU has been hoping that apps developed by member states to track infections will be able to link up when people move within the bloc, mapping the virus s spread better and so creating more security for a revival of travel and tourism. Member states agreed technical standards for this on Tuesday.
But France s approach, which allows central location tracking but has also raised privacy concerns, differs from that of Germany, Italy and others, which log contacts by Bluetooth signal on individual smartphones only.
""It s somewhat more tricky to develop the technical standards for interoperability between decentralised systems, as I think will be the general rule, and the centralised system that France has been aiming for,"" Vestager told the French parliament in a videoconference. 
Germany s app launched on Tuesday, following a standard put in place by Apple  and Alphabet  s Google -- whose iOS and Android operating systems run 99% of the world s smartphones. 
France has also said that access to its centrally held data is a matter of sovereignty. Its app, ""StopCovid"", was launched on June 2 and about 1.5 million people have downloaded and activated it - roughly 2% of the population.

Development of the French app was led by the state research institute Inria, with support from French companies such as the telecoms firm Orange, the IT consulting group Capgemini and the software company Dassault Systèmes. "

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Television series, movies and documentaries about the experience of black people in the United States have seen a surge in viewership as public demonstrations have focused new attention on racial discrimination, according to industry data.
The audience for filmmaker Ava DuVernay s 2016 documentary ""13th,"" about mass incarceration that disproportionately affects black people, jumped more than 47 times higher over the past three weeks, streaming service Netflix Inc  said on Tuesday. Millions of people watched, the company said, though it did not give a specific figure.
DuVernay welcomed the sudden spike in attention for ""13th"" and other movies, books and TV shows about race from people trying to better understand the reasons behind inequality.
""It s rare. It s a once-in-a-generation mood that we re in,"" DuVernay said in an interview with Reuters Television. ""I hope that people that might be engaging with this material now will look to work like this outside of these very tense cultural moments (and) just let it be a very steady stream of learning and enlightenment."" 
Streaming networks have highlighted programming by black creators in recent weeks as protests swelled over the killing of African American George Floyd in U.S. police custody. AT&T Inc s  HBO Max featured a slate of shows and movies under the heading ""Celebrating Black Voices,"" while Walt  Disney  Co s  Hulu included a link to ""Black Stories.""
""Dear White People,"" a Netflix comedy about black Ivy League college students, enjoyed a 331% boost in demand in the United States over the past 30 days, according to Parrot Analytics, which measures downloads, social-media mentions and other data.
DuVernay s Netflix series ""When They See Us,"" about five men wrongly accused of raping a jogger in Central Park in 1989, saw demand jump 83% in that time.
On the Apple TV app , which featured sections called ""Confronting Systemic Racism"" and ""Black in America,"" 2014 Oscar-winning drama ""12 Years a Slave"" climbed to No. 8 among top independent films for the week ending June 14.
That was just behind documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro"" and ""Loving,"" about an interracial couple who prompted a landmark anti-discrimination ruling in 1967.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will trial a new smartphone app aimed at helping to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus on one of the Canary Islands, authorities said on Wednesday.
Europe s latest scheme using Bluetooth technology to log contacts between people and send a warning if any of them test positive for the virus will start in late June on La Gomera, near tourist hot spot Tenerife.
""The aim is to explore the potential of this mobile tracing application in a real-life scenario,"" the archipelago s government said in a statement, adding the results will be used to decide whether to roll out the app nationwide. 
Local authorities have committed to promoting widespread take-up to improve the reliability of the trial s findings, the statement said. Germany s national app was downloaded 6.5 million times in the 24 hours after its launch.
Spain follows several countries - led by Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Poland and Latvia - in opting to use Bluetooth short-range radio, rather than risk invading people s privacy by using location data. 
To guard further against intrusion, contacts between users will be stored on individual devices, rather than passing through a central server. 
Spain has worked with a standard developed by Apple  and Alphabet Inc s Google  - whose systems run a combined 99% of the world s smartphones - to log them securely.
With some 12% of its economy stemming from tourism, Spain is keen for apps developed by different countries to be able to communicate smoothly with each other. 
Home to around 22,000 people, La Gomera is one of the smallest islands in a grouping that is popular with holidaymakers from countries including Germany and Britain.
""La Gomera was chosen because it is a place where the local population and tourists converge,"" the statement said. 
After a rigid lockdown to stem one of Europe s worst outbreaks, Spain has reported a steadily slowing infection rate, and this week started a controlled tourism scheme for another sun-soaked island region, around Mallorca."

SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australia s antitrust regulator warned Google s planned $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness tracker maker Fitbit  may give it too much of people s data, potentially hurting competition in health and online advertising markets.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the first regulator to voice concerns about the deal in a preliminary decision on Thursday. The Alphabet Inc -owned tech giant is already at loggerheads with the Australian government over planned new rules about how internet companies use personal information.
""Buying Fitbit will allow Google to build an even more comprehensive set of user data, further cementing its position and raising barriers to entry to potential rivals,"" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said on Thursday. ""User data available to Google has made it so valuable to advertisers that it faces only limited competition.""
The ACCC, which does not generally have the power to block a deal outside Australia, will announce its final decision on August 13. In previous takeovers, it has ordered certain conditions such as asset sales.
Google wants the deal, announced in November, to help it compete with Apple  and Samsung (KS:005930) in the market for fitness trackers and smart watches.
But consumer groups have raised privacy concerns. The U.S. Justice Department is evaluating the deal, while the European Commission is due to give a ruling in July.
Following an ACCC report last year, the Australian government is working on new rules to force large internet companies to disclose their data usage, and pay for the local media content. Google and  Facebook Inc   oppose most of the proposed changes.
Google said it had promised not to use Fitbit data for advertisements, and to give users choice and control over their data.
""We will be transparent about the data we collect and why - and we do not sell personal information to anyone,"" Google said in an email.

Fitbit was not immediately available for comment."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open slightly lower Thursday after recent gains, amid concerns that a potential second coronavirus wave could stunt the economic recovery.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.4%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 8 points, or 0.1%. The Dow Futures contract fell 114 points, or 0.4%. 
The Dow snapped a three-day winning streak Wednesday, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq powered on, as a rise in infections in a number of states, including Arizona, Florida, and Texas, stoked fears that social distancing restrictions could be reimposed, dealing a fresh blow to the economy.
That said, these indices are still on course to post their fourth winning week out of the last five, helped by hefty amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus and nascent signs of an upturn.
The Bank of England added to this stimulus earlier Thursday, increasing its quantitative easing program by an additional 100 billion pounds, while the European Central Bank carried out what will be its largest ever injection of liquidity, dishing out 1.3 trillion euros in long-term loans at rates as low as -1.0%.
With this in mind, attention will turn to the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), the most up to date gauge of U.S. employment trends.
These claims are expected to be 1.3 million for the week ending June 13, down from 1.54 million reported the prior week, continuing a downward trend as the Covid-19 lockdowns continue to ease. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 19.8 million, compared with 20.9 million the prior week.
Additionally, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for June is expected to come in at a negative 23, which would be an improvement from the negative 43 recorded for May. The negative 56 recorded in April was the lowest level in 40 years.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets reversed losses at the opening to be narrowly mixed after early trading on Thursday, after the latest weekly data for U.S. jobless claims again underlined how long and arduous the road to economic recovery is likely to be. 
Initial jobless claims edged down only slightly to 1.51 million from an upwardly-revised 1.57 million the previous week, while continuing claims - which are reported with a one-week lag but which are considered a more accurate measure of labor market dynamics - stayed stuck above the 20 million mark, defying expectations that they would fall below it for the first time since April.

Apple  was unable to add to the new all-time high it posted on Wednesday, against the backdrop of a looming clash between the U.S. and Europe over the taxing of tech giants. The U.S. withdrew from an international process to devise a new framework for taxing multinationals earlier in the week, something that may hasten the imposition of taxes on digital services by the big European economies. That in turn could threaten a response in the form of import tariffs from the U.S. side, President Trump s trade advisor Peter Navarro has said. 
In other markets, U.S. crude futures rose 0.7% to $38.22 a barrel, regaining some momentum as a meeting to monitor compliance with the so-called  OPEC+  alliance s deal on output restraint passed off without major incident, while executives from major trading companies Vitol and Trafigura told Bloomberg that global demand is picking up quickly.

The prime minister, who announced the partnership with the Canadian technology firms at a briefing outside his Ottawa residence, said users will be able to upload their test results voluntarily onto the app. Initial tests of the program will be done in Ontario; the province’s premier will offer more details later Thursday.
Shopify, which sells e-commerce software to businesses, said the app is “not a Shopify initiative” but is being developed by a group of volunteers from the company. “The national app will be owned and operated by the Government of Canada in cooperation with the provinces and territories,” said Sheryl So, a company spokeswoman.
It will be available across the country as of the beginning of July, Trudeau said. Asked about targets, the he said any usage is helpful but that results would be “extraordinarily useful” if 50% of Canadians signed up.
Positive tests would prompt the app to contact other users that had been in close proximity to the infected person and urge them to contact health authorities. The app has been developed to run in the background of the phone to avoid draining battery life, Trudeau said.
Countries around the world have struggled to implement virus-tracking apps due to restrictions on data collection built into built into smartphones by Apple Inc . and Google .

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc   on Thursday acquired Swedish mapping technology company Mapillary, which collects images from tens of thousands of contributors to build immersive and up-to-date maps, the companies said. 
Mapillary Chief Executive Officer Jan Erik Solem, who founded the Malmö-based startup after leaving Apple Inc  in 2013, said his company s technology would be used to power products like Facebook Marketplace and supply data to humanitarian organizations.
Solem had sold a facial recognition startup, Polar Rose, to Apple in 2010.
Facebook confirmed the transaction, but declined to disclose the terms. Mapillary did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mapillary aims to solve one of the most expensive problems in mapping: keeping maps updated with ""street level data"" about signs, addresses and other information that can be observed from the road.
Big companies such as Apple and Alphabet  Inc s Google solve the problem by sending out fleets of vehicles outfitted with cameras and other sensors to gather images.
Mapillary crowdsources the images, ingesting pictures contributed from smart phones and other types of cameras, and uses ""computer vision"" technology to stitch them together into a three-dimensional map.
Many consider that information key for self-driving car technology, although a Facebook spokesman said it would also underpin Facebook products under development like augmented reality glasses and virtual reality headsets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will switch to the Apple  and Google  model for its COVID-19 test-and-trace app, ditching an attempt to develop an app by itself after the homegrown system did not work well enough on Apple s iPhone, the government said on Thursday.
The test-and-trace programme is key to reopening the country but has been dogged by problems. A smartphone app developed by the National Health Service (NHS) was initially expected to be rolled out nationwide in May but did not materialise.
Health minister Matt Hancock appeared to blame Apple in part for the pivot, adding that the decentralised Google-Apple system would benefit from work done on the abortive NHS app.
""As it stands, our app won t work because Apple won t change their system, but it can measure distance. And their app can t measure distance well enough, to a standard we are satisfied with,"" he said at the daily news conference.
""So we ve agreed to join forces with Google and Apple, to bring the best bits of both systems together.""
Dido Harding, head of the test-and-trace programme has described the app as the ""cherry on the cake"" of the overall test-and-trace system, playing down its centrality to the programme.
But figures for the second week of England s test-and-trace showed that while over 85,000 people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus had been reached in the first two weeks, over 25% of positive cases could not be reached.
Officials running the programme admitted that the change of tack on the app was unplanned but denied that it was a setback, emphasising that they did not want to rush out an app which fell short of standards.
But the opposition Labour party said that warnings about the homegrown app had not been heeded.
""This is unsurprising and yet another example of where the government’s response has been slow and badly managed. It’s meant precious time and money wasted,"" Labour health spokesman Jon Ashworth said.
Britain s adoption of the  decentralised  approach for its app followed a growing number of European countries, including Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Austria. 
But Apple and Google s model has frustrated governments, as they undercut the technology s usefulness by prioritising user privacy.
The pivot happened after the NHS app, which was being tested on the Isle of Wight off the southern coast of England, was found to work well on Google s Android operating systems but not on Apple iPhones. 
However, Britain wants further improvements to the Google-Apple platform, meaning that the original hope of a launch in May is set to be missed by months rather than weeks.

""We re not going to put a date on it I m afraid because I m absolutely determined that whilst this technology can help, it s got to be working effectively,"" Hancock said."

SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - Main Street investors who have reaped windfall gains from the steepest stock market rebound on record now seem to be making for safety, brokers say, just as Wall Street experts are advising clients to dip their toes into riskier assets again.
Over the past three months, the favourite stocks of ""mom-and-pop"" traders have run up even harder than the broader market s 40% rise.
But many of these novices, who began trading partly as entertainment and partly as plunging prices made stocks more attractive, now appear to be shifting strategy and cashing out of the frothiest sectors, or moving into safer-seeming bets.
Customers at Saxo Markets in Singapore have been reducing long positions at gathering pace this month. Asian investors with TD Ameritrade  are selling soaring tech companies for banks, while other brokers report demand for blue chips.
The moves flip the image of retail investors as ""moths,"" as they are called in Thailand for their reputation of being drawn to bright lights only to get burned, since small traders appear to have led rather than lagged professionals this time.
""Some of the pros on Wall Street might be pulling their hair out, saying that this fundamentally doesn t make sense,"" said Chris Brankin, chief executive at TD Ameritrade in Singapore.
""But I don t think they have anything to compare it with...whereas retail investors kind of go more with the money flow and sentiment of the markets.""
A basket of stocks popular with retail investors, including Tesla ,  Moderna   and  Snap Inc  , surged 61% from Wall Street s March low, compared with a 45% rise in a portfolio favoured by professionals, according to Goldman Sachs . 
FORGET NUMBERS
Like other banks, Goldman analysts recommend clients avoid the energy sector, prefer utilities to financials and expect techs  hot run to continue. But Asian broker analysis suggests retail buyers are going their own way.
""Sometimes I think reports out of fancy brokerages are bullshit,"" said Lee Sang-hoon, a 37-year-old office worker in South Korea.
He has made a 44% return on his initial 140 million won ($115,740) investments since March, trading U.S. stocks in the Seoul night and relying on Google  Trends data to track investor mood.
""When Google says there s going to be more buyers, I buy. Forget numbers, if the sentiment is strong, the market goes up.""
Lee has exposure to volatile U.S. shale oil and gas, and does not plan to reduce his investments yet, but also holds local blue-chips to balance his portfolio.
TD Ameritrade said its Asia clients sold Apple  and Tencent (HK:0700) last month, and bought Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and J.P. Morgan . Singapore s PhillipCapital said its customers, even in the 18-25 year-old bracket, were buying dividend-paying blue chips or cashing out. 
Australia s biggest retail broker, CommSec, reported a shift away from volatile stocks such as Treasury Wine Estates  and into big banks and miners.
To be sure, retail traders are still placing incredibly risky bets, such as on bankrupt car-rental company Hertz .
""I can t imagine that anyone who went to business school or works at an asset manager would buy shares in a bankrupt company,"" said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist and portfolio manager at mutual fund MFS in Boston.
""Historically, the retail investor is the last one at the party and they don t know the cops are on their way,"" he said.
But the fear of passing up a once in a lifetime chance is strong. 
""Retail investors had missed out on the long-term big rally since the 2008 global financial crisis,"" said Taye Shim, president director of Indonesia s Mirae Asset Sekuritas.
""I think they are more encouraged to not let this one pass,"" he said.

Apple had planned to reopen about 100 U.S. stores, mostly with curbside pickup but some with walk-in service, in late May as lockdown restrictions began to ease.
However, cases in the United States have been steadily rising, with over 2.2 million people infected and at least 118,396 people dead.

New cases of COVID-19 set records across at least six U.S. states, and mandated mask use is becoming more common as economies continue reopening. China, where the pandemic originated but had been contained, also reported an uptick in new cases of the disease.
""Throughout the week there have been increasing news items regarding a spike of COVID cases in the U.S. and around the world, and that s led to fears of the economy not recovering as quickly as people hoped,"" Tuz added.

Still, for the week, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are all on track to post solid percentage gains.
The S&P 500 and the Dow are now about 9% and 13% shy of their respective all-time highs reached in February. The tech-heavy Nasdaq hovers around 1% below its last closing high reached on June 10, after breaching that level earlier in the session.
Trading volume is typically light on summer Fridays as investors head into the weekend.
But Friday marks ""quadruple witching,"" in which futures and options expiries occur, and that typically translates into elevated volume and liquidity. The S&P is synchronizing its delayed rebalancing to take advantage of that liquidity, which could drive volumes even higher.

Investing.com - Wall Street gave up gains on Friday, as Apple turned negative after announcing it would close some stores across the U.S. again following a rise in Covid-19 cases.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21%, or 54 points, the S&P 500 fell  0.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.18%.
After hitting record highs intraday, Apple  fell 1% after announcing it would reclose 11 stores across the U.S. in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Arizona following a rise in coronavirus cases. 
The fall in Apple comes as Wall Street continued to express optimism on the tech giant ahead of the upcoming launch of its 5G iPhone.

The move from Apple exacerbated investor concerns that an ongoing rise in coronavirus cases could hamper the pace of economic reopening.

Investing.com - The Dow claimed a weekly win despite rounding off the week on a sour note as investors assessed whether Apple s decision to close some its U.S. stores in the midst of rising infections was a sign that parts of the U.S. could be forced to roll back the easing of some restrictions to curtail growing outbreaks.

Wall Street, however, largely shrugged off Apple s announcement, insisting that store closures are unlikely to have a significant impact on near-term demand ahead of the tech giants  launch of its 5G iPhone, expected in the fall.

Export orders for Taiwan, seen as a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 0.4% from a year earlier to $38.9 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Saturday. The uptick, however, lagged a Reuters poll estimate for a 1.1% rise compared with 2.3% growth in April.
The ministry, which has repeatedly cautioned of a difficult outlook for Taiwan s orders due to the coronavirus impact, said the May numbers were helped by ""flourishing"" demand for equipment from people working from home.
Looking ahead, the outlook was brighter with the pandemic abating in Europe and the United States and economic activity gradually resuming around the world, it added.
However, it cautioned that uncertainties from the pandemic, as well as China-U.S. trade tensions, could still harm Taiwan s export.
The ministry said it expects June export orders to be in a range of 0% growth to a 3.9% rise from a year earlier.
Taiwan s manufacturers, a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc  and Huawei Technologies, have been hit hard by faltering global demand for electronics in the wake of containment measures and lockdowns in many countries.
May orders from the United States rose 8.6% from a year earlier, compared with 6.8% growth in April, while those from China were up 2.7% versus a 9.2% gain the previous month. European orders rose 12.3% but were down 8.1% from Japan.
Taiwan s economic growth slowed to its weakest in nearly four years in the first quarter as the pandemic crimped domestic consumption and tourism.

In response, the government has stepped up support measures, and is rolling out a stimulus package it expects will eventually be worth T$1.05 trillion ($35.01 billion)."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar touched a three-week high and commodity currencies were stalled on Monday, as renewed worries about a second wave of coronavirus infections sent investors into safer assets.
Moves were modest, as few expect spiking case numbers to prompt fresh lockdowns at this point.
But with the World Health Organization reporting a record increase in global cases on Sunday, especially in the Americas, and Apple Inc  protectively closing 11 U.S. stores last week, there was no immediate cause for optimism either.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD), the dollar held on to small gains won last week and moved a whisker higher to 97.744, before edging back to flat.
The greenback was marginally lower against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, and steady on the yuan, euro and British pound.
The yen  was firm at 106.92 per U.S. dollar, not far from a one-month high of 106.58 hit earlier this month.
""We expect the FX markets to remain caught between recovering economic indicators and concerns about a second-wave of COVID-19 infections in the week ahead,"" analysts at  Barclays   said in a note.
Barclays expects continued pressure on the kiwi, but said gains in the euro are possible if Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data due on Tuesday beats expectations and recommended going long on euro/dollar, with a $1.14 target.
The single currency (EUR=) last traded flat at $1.1176 after dipping to a three-week low of $1.1168 in early trade - squeezed as European Union leaders remain divided on how to structure a planned COVID-19 recovery fund.
The pound , weighted as well by Brexit worries since there has been little progress in trade discussions with Europe, held just above a three-week low at $1.2363.
LOCKDOWNS LINGER
Total global coronavirus cases are now over 8.7 million and focus has been on whether this may drive fresh lockdowns.
While that is seen as unlikely, localised restrictions have been re-imposed in Beijing to contain an outbreak there and Australia s Victoria state has also re-imposed limits on gatherings to contain a spike in cases.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  slipped against the U.S. dollar and yen in morning trade, before paring losses to inch about 0.2% higher against both. It last bought $0.6844 and 73.18 yen. 
The New Zealand dollar  was also a fraction stronger at US$0.6418, though both currencies have lost the momentum they had in early June.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand announces its latest benchmark interest rate settings on Wednesday. It is all but certain to keep rates on hold at 0.25%, leaving markets to focus on its tone and on talk of negative rates in the future.
Besides Tuesday s PMI data and German sentiment surveys, also due on Tuesday, investors will also be looking to U.S. consumer sentiment figures to gauge whether encouraging signs of recovery from May can be sustained. 
A jump in net short bets on the U.S. dollar last week to their highest since 2018 suggests investors are positioned for the world s rapid economic recovery to continue apace - leaving plenty of room for surprises on the downside.
At the same time, a slowdown in global central banks drawing on the U.S. Federal Reserve s emergency dollar funding lines could also provide dollar support.
While the reduction in central bank currency swaps, on one hand, suggests a return to normality, it also marks a pullback in one aspect of the Fed s enormous support for global markets.
""It won t take much for the market to see this as a liquidity headwind,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.

""And when we mix in rising concerns around a renewed COVID crisis then it may keep risk on the back foot this week."""

LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery in world stocks faltered on Monday as the threat of rising coronavirus infections in parts of Europe and the United States curbed risk appetite, boosting demand for safe-haven gold.
European stocks fell 0.3% at the open after Germany s coronavirus reproduction rate rose over the weekend to 2.88 on Sunday from 1.06 on Friday, health authorities said.
The rise, mainly driven by outbreaks in meat processing plants, brings with it the possibility of renewed restrictions on activity, a move that could end any economic rebound.
""I regard the German R statistic as a bit of a red herring or more of a statistical quirk,"" said Chris Bailey, Raymond James European strategist.
""Coronavirus at-the-margin remains an overhang but the opening up of Europe still looks on much more solid foundations than the US/Americas."" 
U.S. stock futures were up 0.8%, continuing to shrug off a spike in infections. In Asia, Japan s Nikkei (N225) fell 0.2% and MSCI s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was almost flat.

In further evidence that United States was far from returning to normal, Apple  said on Friday that it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as coronavirus cases rose in some states.
Those concerns sent gold 0.5% higher to $1,752 per ounce, near its May peak of $1,764.8, which was its strongest since October 2012.
Record stimulus measures to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic will leave advanced economies with much higher debt than the accumulated during the 2008/09 financial crisis, Moody s  estimated in a report.
""Government debt/GDP ratios will rise by around 19 percentage points, nearly twice as much as in 2009 during the GFC ... the rise in debt burdens will be more immediate and pervasive, reflecting the acuteness and breadth of the shock posed by the coronavirus."" Moody s said.
The pandemic is accelerating globally with the World Health Organization reporting a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Sunday.
""The second wave is becoming a theme for markets,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global strategist at JPMorgan  Asset Management.
""Whether there will be a lockdown may vary depending on region. It will be a tough decision for politicians. But they probably have no other choice if they are running out of hospital beds,"" he said.
Torn between record stimulus and growing fears of second- wave infections, stocks have been moving sideways in recent weeks. They had risen more than 40% from March lows on hopes the worst of the pandemic was over.
Global stock market valuations are now at their highest since 2002 compared with projected earnings in the coming 12 months.

Investors are also wary of developments in Hong Kong after details of a new security law for the territory showed Beijing will have overarching powers on its enforcement.
China s top legislative body, the National People s Congress Standing Committee, will meet on June 28, and the Global Times reported it was likely to enact the Hong Kong security law by July 1.
Hong Kong s Hang Seng (HSI) fell 0.7%, underperforming regional markets.
Major currencies were mostly steady. The euro traded at $1.1205 (EUR=), near its lowest in nearly three weeks.
The yen traded at 106.92 per dollar , not far from a one-month high of 106.58 to the dollar earlier this month.
Oil prices strengthened on tighter supplies from major producers, but concerns that the rising coronavirus cases could curb demand checked gains.

Investing.com -- Is there any value in Wirecard AG ?
By mid-morning trading on Monday in Frankfurt, the market s answer was increasingly firm-looking ""no"". The fallen star of the German fintech universe was under fresh pressure after admitting that the 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in cash that it said last week it couldn’t find probably never existed, pulling its last financial accounts and warning that it may have to do the same for previous years. 
The Munich-based payments group added that it was looking at ways of immediately reducing costs, which can only mean large-scale layoffs and the abandonment of all but essential operations.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the stock was at 17.25 euros, down 33% from Friday’s close, down over 80% from before last week’s revelations, and down over 90% from its peak in 2018, when the company took the place of the decaying giant Commerzbank  in the benchmark DAX index. Adding insult to Commerzbank s injury is the fact that it is one of the group s biggest lenders.
The company’s 2024 bonds were also trading at levels that implied a high risk of imminent bankruptcy, quoted at between 24 and 28.5 cents on the euro.
Among all this bleakness was one crumb of comfort: the company’s lenders are still talking to it and have not – yet – decided to call in their loans, triggering a cash crunch that could push the company into insolvency. But one can assume that this is as much due to a desperate attempt to avoid the embarrassment of booking the loans as non-performing rather than any expectations of recovering actual value. 
According to Bloomberg, the company has drawn over 90% of a 1.75 billion euro revolving credit facility. The outstanding 2024 bond issue adds another 500 million euros to the pile. Its other liabilities appear negligible, by comparison.
On the asset side of the balance sheet, its last reported statements showed 3.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, of which 1.9 billion is almost certainly non-existent. It also showed 1.2 billion euros in receivables but, given that the scandal here revolves around allegations of false invoicing, the receivables number has to be sharply discounted too.
Wirecard is a payments business, so most of its remaining assets – some 1.5 billion euros, according to the balance sheet – are intangible. Around half of that number is goodwill, a notoriously slippery accounting term.
It would be surprising if a company that couldn’t even count its cash properly had understated its intangibles but, in fairness, there probably is some value in Wirecard’s intellectual property and its partnerships if (a big if) current partners such as Visa  and Mastercard , are prepared to continue working with it. And one has to doubt that the world will notice if it the Apple  and Android app stores have one less mobile wallet to offer."

TSMC s clients include Huawei s chip division HiSilicon. However, the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei over security concerns and trade disputes with China has left the world s biggest contract chipmaker exposed to diplomatic developments between two countries where it also has production bases.
Last month, the company unveiled plans for a $12-billion plant in the United States just hours before the U.S. Commerce Department outlined a proposal to amend chip export rules - a move that would restrict TSMC s sales to Huawei.
The amendment would require licences for sales of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology to Huawei, the world s biggest supplier of telecoms equipment and its second-largest smartphone maker.
Kung Ming-hsin, the new head of Taiwan s economic planning agency, the National Development Council, said the United States was taking aim at a specific company, not Taiwan s economic relations with China, the island s largest trading partner. 
""The United States has not asked Taiwan to cut off all ties with China. It s aimed at Huawei,"" Kung told reporters in Taipei.
The main reason the United States has targeted Huawei is because it was not transparent and had too close a relationship with the Chinese government, he added, charges the company has denied.
""As for TSMC, although their orders no longer have Huawei, they ve quickly been filled up, as other people really need them,"" Kung said, without elaborating.
TSMC declined to comment, saying it did not comment on its customers.

The chairman of TSMC, a supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc , said this month the firm could quickly fill any order gap should U.S. curbs prevent sales to Huawei."

Investing.com -- The city that never sleeps but which closed down for Covid is reopening for business. The news on the Covid front from the U.S. sunbelt is less encouraging, though, and the virus continues to spread rapidly in Latin America.  Stocks are set to open moderately higher on a light day for economic and corporate news, and Apple  will host its Worldwide Developers Conference under the cloud of a new antitrust investigation. Germany s fallen fintech star Wirecard is fighting for survival. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, June 22nd. 
1. New York gets back to work
Up to another 300,000 New York City residents will head back to work on Monday as the city enters phase 2 of its reopening in the wake of its battle with the Covid-19 coronavirus.
The new phase of reopening includes in-store retail, hair salons, offices, real estate, vehicle sales, rentals and leases, commercial building management and retail rental, repair and cleaning.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has approved restaurants to use sidewalks or kerbside parking spaces for outdoor dining, amid evidence that viral transmission is much lower outdoors. All establishments must still follow social distancing rules, with masks required of both staff and customers when they are within six feet of people.
New York was hit worse than any other part of the U.S. by the virus’ first wave, the worst affected region of the U.S., accounting for around one quarter of the 120,000 U.S. deaths recorded so far during the pandemic.
2. Virus recedes in Beijing, advances in LatAm and U.S. Sunbelt
New York isn’t the only place relaxing its Covid rules today. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also expected to announce fresh measures to reopen the economy. In addition, the Chinese capital of Beijing reported only seven new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, suggesting that its typically robust reaction to last week’s outbreak has had positive effects.
However, the virus hasn’t gone away. Brazil passed the 50,000 milestone for deaths at the weekend, while Mexico, which began reopening its economy last week, posted its second-highest daily number of new cases.
Across the U.S. ‘sun belt’ too, case numbers have continued to rise, with California, Florida and Texas all reporting over 4,000 new cases on Sunday.
At his first re-election campaign rally on Friday, President Donald Trump said he had told his aides to slow down the rate of testing for Covid-19, a comment that his aides subsequently played down as “light-hearted”.
3. Stocks set to open higher 
U.S. stocks are set to open higher, with the reopening narrative dominating the second-wave fears that pushed major indices lower on Friday.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 191 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 futures contracts were up in line.
Of interest later in the day will be Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference, where the company is expected to confirm a move to make its own chips for the next generation of Mac computers. The meeting is expected to be overshadowed by a brewing dispute with app developers over the terms of access to its App Store.
The European Union last week opened an antitrust investigation into possible abuse of a dominant market position. That didn’t stop the stock hitting new all-time highs, however.
4. Wirecard fights for survival 
One of Europe’s brightest tech hopes was fighting for survival on Monday after fresh disclosures about accounting fraud at the company over the weekend.
German payments company Wirecard said that some $2.1 billion of cash it had claimed to have on its balance sheet in trustee accounts in the Philippines had probably never existed.
The central bank governor of the Philippines said at the weekend that the funds had never entered the country’s payments system.
The company pulled its financial statements for the last year and warned it may have to do the same for previous years’ too. It’s still trying to persuade lenders not to terminate some $2 billion in loans, something that would likely push it into insolvency.
5. Oil consolidates as rig count hits new low
U.S. crude oil prices consolidated just below the $40 level, pausing for breath after last week’s rally amid lingering concern that a second wave of coronavirus infections could derail the recovery in oil demand.
By 6:30, U.S. crude futures were down 0.3% at $39.73 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was down 0.1% at $42.13 a barrel.
On Friday, oilfield services company Baker Hughes had said that the number of active oil rigs in the U.S. fell to its lowest in 11 years, strengthening perceptions of a cap on U.S. output in the near term.
Elsewhere on Monday, there were fresh indications of lingering overhang of supply, as India – one of the world’s largest importers - said it had filled its strategic petroleum reserve."

These indices last week recorded their fourth winning week out of the last five, helped by the hefty amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus and nascent signs of economic recovery.
Economic data points have continued to show improvement, with the initial jobless claims data dropping again last week, although the pace of decline stalled, while retail sales showed a sharp jump. 
The economy has continued to reopen, with New York City, one of the hardest hit regions in the U.S., moving to phase 2, allowing New Yorkers, among other things, to go to hairdressers and enjoy outdoor dining.
That said, the World Health Organization reported a record jump in global coronavirus cases on Sunday, with the biggest increase seen in North and South America.
There have also been spikes in coronavirus infection rates in several U.S. states, notably in the south of the country. Nearly 120,000 Americans have died to date, over one quarter of the global total of 469,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Economic data releases are limited Monday, with May’s existing home sales the main number. Later in the week durable goods orders are expected to rebound but remain below pre-virus levels.
Thursday’s closely watched report on initial jobless claims will be the main event, as it provides the timeliest data on the economy’s health.
In corporate news, American Airlines  Group announced that it is planning to secure $3.5 billion in new financing to enhance its liquidity position.
Apple  will also be in the spotlight as it hosts its Worldwide Developers Conference. It announced on Friday that it would temporarily shut 11 U.S. stores as the coronavirus cases rose, and was also hit with two antitrust probes by the EU last week.
Oil prices were largely unchanged Monday, helped by the news that the number of operating oil and natural gas rigs operating in Canada and the U.S. fell to a record low last week, but weighed by concerns that a record rise in global coronavirus cases could curb a recovery in fuel demand.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned around in early trade Monday to trade modestly higher, after falling at the open on a lack of reassurance over fiscal stimulus from White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow.
Kudlow told CNBC that ""nothing has been decided yet"" about the size of the next coronavirus relief package. Analysts have warned that the economy faces a severe blow if support payments that are scheduled to end in July aren t extended in one form or other. Kudlow s comments took the gloss off a day marked by optimism at the further reopening of New York City s economy. 
Also weighing on sentiment was the awareness of rising numbers of new coronavirus infections in some of the country s largest states, including California, Texas and Florida, as well as announcement of a dilutive capital raising exercise by American Airlines , which said it wanted to raise up to $1.5 billion in stock and convertible notes.  The stock fell 4.6%.

Apple  stock outperformed, rising 1.5% ahead of the start of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference later in the day. The iPhone maker is widely expected to announce a move to make its own chips for the next generation of Mac computers, in what would represent a break from its current supplier Intel . Intel stock was down 0.4%. Apple s conference also comes less than a week after the European Union opened two new antitrust investigations against the company for possible abuse of its App Store. 
Apple s decision to temporarily close some stores in coronavirus hotspots in the U.S. had been a major factor in the market s turnaround late on Friday. However, the mood had largely bucked up again by Monday, as New York reopened much of its retail sector, including cafes, restaurants and hair salons.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Monday announced a system to let iPhone owners unlock and start cars with their devices at its annual conference for software developers.
The new system, which also lets users share digital car keys with friends and family members via the company s iMessage system, will work with BMW  5 Series vehicles that will ship next month, Apple said in a virtual keynote filmed at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. 
The system will work with phones running the current iOS 13 operating system so that owners can start using it when BMW vehicles arrive. Apple said more cars that work with the system will come to market next year.
Apple also updated its mapping application with information about electric vehicle charging stations, working with BMW and  Ford Motor Co   to show stations compatible with the user s vehicle.
The automotive announcements came at an annual conference where Apple was expected to signal a departure from  Intel Corp  s  almost 15-year run supplying Mac computer processors.
Apple s Worldwide Developer Conference comes as paid services sold through the App Store have become central to the Cupertino, California, company s revenue growth as consumers have slowed the growth of iPhone upgrades. Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of the sales developers make through the App Store, which is the only way to distribute software onto Apple s mobile devices.
Those fees, and Apple s strict app review process, have come under antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, where regulators last week unveiled a formal probe into the company.
But developers still gravitate toward Apple s platform because it is lucrative, with a user base that is willing to spend money on paid apps. The annual developer conference, being held online this year for the first time because of the novel coronavirus, is where Apple often announces access to new hardware capabilities, such as special tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality.
Apple this year could announce a move to part ways with Intel, which has supplied processors for Mac computers since 2006. Apple could announce a move to use its own house-designed processors as soon as Monday, two people familiar with matter told Reuters. The company, which already uses its own processor designs in iPhones in iPads, could announce one laptop model and one desktop model that will use the new chips, one of the people told Reuters.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company s future plans or products.

If Apple announces the move Monday, it will build on a tool it introduced last year called Catalyst, which aims to make it easier for developers to move their apps from Apple s mobile operating systems to Mac computers."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Monday said it would let software developers ""challenge"" the guidelines that govern its app review process and will end its practice of blocking routine bug fixes over minor violations.
Apple s App Store is the only way for developers to distribute their software to consumers  iPhones and iPads. Apple keeps between 15% and 30% of revenues generated by developers in the store, making it a key part of its growth strategy as the pace of iPhone upgrades has slowed.
To get into the store, apps undergo a review process governed by Apple guidelines. Some rules, such as requiring apps to offer an option to use Apple s in-app purchasing and split revenues with the iPhone maker, have become a flash point.
Software makers have long been able to appeal Apple s rulings, but several told Reuters they are frustrated by the fact Apple retains the final say.
AWeber, a Pennsylvania-based maker of email marketing software, went back and forth with Apple for months last year over whether it needed to remove account creation links from its app and add in-app purchasing. 
“They’d flag something, we would make some modifications, and they would flag something different,"" Tom Kulzer, the company s chief executive, told Reuters. 
In a news release, Apple said it will now provide a ""mechanism"" for developers to ""challenge"" the guidelines. A spokesman declined to elaborate.
Apple also said it will no longer delay routine bug fixes over App Store guideline violations unless they relate to ""legal issues,"" instead requiring fixes at the next major release.
Developers said those delays angered customers.

Foxconn already makes smartphones in India for Apple Inc  and Xiaomi  Corp, though in March said it suspended production due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Chairman Liu Young-way told Foxconn s annual general meeting that looking ahead, India was a bright spot for development even though there was a ""certain impact"" at present due to the virus. 
""We are fully pushing ahead with next steps there, and maybe in a few months  time we can reveal on our website the next steps and report back to everyone. We ll have further investment there,"" Liu said, without detailing plans or reasons for the firm s view on the business outlook in India.
Foxconn s January-March profit plunged to its lowest in two decades after the outbreak forced the firm to suspend manufacturing in China and knocked demand from customers including Apple.
But the firm, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, last month said the worst of the outbreak for it was over.
Liu described the first-quarter results as a ""special case"" that reflected the effect of the virus. He said there were no infections at its China plants so it was able to resume operations earlier than it expected.
Foxconn is seeking to make up virus-related losses at its China plants with ""resources"" from customers and local governments. Liu did not elaborate apart from saying such activity would take place gradually over several quarters.
He also said, looking forward, a second wave of global coronavirus infection was a risk to its business.
For the second quarter, Foxconn has said it expects revenue to show double-digit percentage growth versus January-March, though it will still likely book a single-digit decline from the same period a year earlier.

Foxconn is best known for assembling Apple s iPhones, many at its factories in China."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday after President Donald Trump moved to dispel concerns about a new trade war between the U.S. and China.
Trump had publicly contradicted his trade advisor Peter Navarro late on Monday after Navarro told Fox News that the phase-one trade deal signed in January, under which the U.S. had suspended many of the import tariffs it had imposed over the previous 18 months, was ""over."" Trump said via Twitter the deal was ""fully intact.""
Data from the USDA and others suggest that China has fallen far short of its commitments under the deal to buy U.S. farm goods, as its own economic growth - and demand for commodities - has fallen far short of what it had expected before the coronavirus pandemic. As such, market participants interpreted Trump s intervention as less a statement of fact than an admission that there was no stomach for raising tariffs again - a measure that would hit U.S. consumers  spending power at a time when over 20 million are unemployed. 
By 9:45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 275 points, or 1.1% at 26,300, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.9%.
There was also better news from the economy: New home sales rose faster than expected in May to 676,000. Meanwhile, IHS Markit s purchasing manager index for June also rebounded more than expected to 49.6 from 39.8 in May.  Services in particular rebounded smartly as businesses started to re-emerge from lockdown. As with similar PMIs released earlier in Europe Tuesday, the figures still showed the economy contracting this month - albeit at a slower rate than in May. 
Among individual stocks, Apple  stock marched to a new all-time high after the first day of its Worldwide Developers Conference passed off without any major surprises. The company confirmed that it will start using its own chips in the next generation of laptops and Macs.  Bank stocks were also in favor, with JPMorgan Chase & Co  stock,  Citigroup   and Bank of America  all rising over 2%. 
Elsewhere,  American Airlines Group   stock fell 5.6% after the company priced its share offering at $13.50 a share, a discount of nearly 10% to Monday s closing price. The issue s pricing was hurt by the company s decision to increase its size to $2 billion from an originally envisaged $1.5 billion.
In other markets,Gold Futures hit an eight-year high as investors continued to price in currency debasement through a likely long period of ultra-low interest rates and asset purchases. By 10:15, gold futures for delivery on the Comex exchange were at $1,783.36, up 1.0% on the day.  U.S. Crude Oil futures, meanwhile, hit their highest level since early March on signs that OPEC s crackdown on quota-busting had had some effect. WTI was up 0.7% at $41.00 a barrel."

The report by the European Commission, seen by Reuters, sought to assess the effectiveness of the EU s landmark data privacy rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) adopted in 2018.
GDPR requires companies to seek people s consent before using their personal data or face steep fines. European Vice President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova has previously lauded the rules as a compass to guide the EU into the digital age.
The report said that data protection agencies across the 27-country bloc had increased staff by 42% increase and budgets by 49% between 2016-2019, but the Irish and Luxembourg governments needed to do more.
""Given that the largest big tech multinationals are established in Ireland and Luxembourg, the data protection authorities of these countries act as lead authorities in many important cross-border cases and may need larger resources than their population would otherwise suggest,"" the report said.
The Irish watchdog has opened cases into Facebook, Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Twitter, Apple , Verizon  Media, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn  and U.S. digital advertiser Quantcast.
The report urged national watchdogs to launch joint investigations that would lead to more harmonised rules and approaches.
It said some of the challenges were reconciling data privacy rights with the right to freedom of expression, and how to apply the rules to technologies such as artificial intelligence, facial recognition, blockchain and the internet of things.
Enforcement continues to be the weak link, said Eva Simon at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe.

""There are still far too many governments, organisations and businesses flouting the rules,"" she said."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will try out a new smartphone app aimed at thwarting the spread of the coronavirus by injecting hundreds of false cases into the system in a test run starting on Friday on the Canary Island of Gomera.
The simulation is part of a system intended to send an alert when one user has been in contact with another who receives a postive diagnosis, the government said.
""The idea is that approximately 3,000 people download it and we will introduce around 300 simulators, beta testers, to mimic a pandemic among 10% of the population,"" a government spokeswoman said. 
It will use Bluetooth short-range radio to log contacts. 
To guard against impinging on people s privacy, contact records will be stored on individual devices rather than a central server, using a standard developed by Apple  and Google .
The trial will start on Friday and continue for two weeks, a period the government hopes will be enough to prove whether the app could be rolled out across the country.
Technology and defence company Indra has been contracted to manage the pilot at a cost of about $375,000.
Gomera is home to about 22,000 residents near the tourist hotspot of Tenerife.
More than 28,000 people have died in the coronavirus pandemic in Spain, but the situation has eased and the country is emerging from a strict lockdown.
The government is anxious to get the tourist industry, a mainstay of the economy, back on its feet and the Canary Islands are a popular destination. They had 2,398 confirmed coronavirus cases out of a national total of 245,268 as of June 18.

(Reuters) - Wall Street s three major indexes rose on Tuesday as improving economic data and the prospect of more stimulus bolstered hopes of a swift recovery, while a jump in technology shares powered the Nasdaq to another record high.
White House advisor Larry Kudlow said tax rebates and direct mail checks are on the table in the next coronavirus relief bill.
The Nasdaq hit a fifth record high this month with Apple Inc  providing the biggest boost after at least three brokerages raised their price targets, a day after the iPhone maker said it would use its own chips for Mac computers.
The pace of contraction in U.S. manufacturing and services sectors slowed in June as businesses reopened after the health crisis resulted in a lockdown in mid-March.
Another set of data showed new home sales jumped 16.6% in May, blowing past estimates of a 2.9% rise.
""The market seems to be in a liquidity-driven FOMO (fear of missing out) mode where Fed has your back and U.S. government will probably come back to the table in the next two to three weeks to continue to do more stimulus,"" said Nate Fischer, chief investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners in Cleveland, Ohio.
""It would be healthy for the market to probably chop sideways here in the next couple weeks and then in earning season see if companies really feel as bullish as the markets.""
Global equity markets were also boosted by President Donald Trump s assurance that the Phase 1 trade agreement with China was ""fully intact"" after adviser Peter Navarro sparked confusion by saying the deal was over.
While U.S.-China tensions have been a cause for concern, monetary and fiscal support worth trillions of dollars has in part powered the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX), with the index just about 7% below its Feb. 19 record high.

Investing.com -- Tech stocks continued to climb to new records Tuesday, shrugging off fears about a second wave of Covid-19 infections that are weighing on other sectors exposed to the success of businesses reopening.
Investors appear to be betting that tech giants like Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc  and Netflix Inc  will come out of the pandemic ahead. The stocks hit fresh highs as home-bound consumers turned to the internet and streaming services to keep busy during lockdowns.
The reopening plans around the country were threatened by mounting new coronavirus cases. Government data on crude oil inventories – which investors use to judge whether business demand for fuel is rising or falling – is due out Wednesday.
Investors will also be watching to see if tech can continue its rally, along with financials. While stocks rose on Tuesday, the indexes had given back some of their gains by the closing bell.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. More Information on Oil Inventory Gives Reading of Demand
The Energy Information Administration s crude inventory numbers for the week ending June 19 are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) on Wednesday. The closely watched number is used by investors to judge whether demand is rising or falling. On Tuesday, the industry s own weekly report showed a higher than expected increase in crude oil in storage, a potentially bearish sign.
2. Can tech giants continue their record-breaking climb?
FAANG giants hit new highs on Tuesday, pulling the NASDAQ Composite to its own record as tech investors seem to be unworried about possible interruptions to the economic recovery from Covid-19 shutdowns.
Investors will be looking to see if this group can keep up the momentum. Apple is surging after a bunch of announcements out of its Worldwide Developers Conference, including new operating systems for its iPhones and the announcement it would be using its own processing chips in new Mac computers.
Meanwhile, Netflix and Amazon also hit new highs.
3. Financial Stocks Could Be a Proxy For Economic Revival
Bank stocks are also surging on the prospect of more stimulus money on the way from Washington. That benefits big lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co ,  Citigroup  Inc , and Bank of America Corp  because it puts money in the hands of businesses and consumers to spend more.
On Tuesday, Trump administration officials were busy shaking off mixed signals on China-U.S. trade and focused on getting out the word on stimulus. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared to cheer investors by saying a fourth round of stimulus, about $1 trillion, would be introduced in the next few weeks and aimed at getting people back to work."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government financing for projects to return critical supply chains to the United States as part of coronavirus response efforts could reach tens of billions of dollars and clients may include a projected $12 billion Taiwanese semiconductor plant, the head of the agency managing the funds told Reuters.
The U.S. International Development Finance Corp is talking to companies about reshoring the manufacturing of personal protective equipment, generic drugs and pharmaceutical ingredients, DFC Chief Executive Adam Boehler said in an interview on Monday.
Boehler said letters of understanding for some initial projects could be signed within the next month. The Trump administration has been pushing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-supply-chains/u-s-mulls-paying-companies-tax-breaks-to-pull-supply-chains-from-china-idUSKBN22U0FH for U.S. companies and importers to move manufacturing out of China.
The agency, which opened its doors in January to boost U.S. overseas development financing efforts to counter China s massive Belt and Road infrastructure drive, was drafted into domestic service in May, after President Donald Trump signed an executive order https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/eo-delegating-authority-dpa-ceo-u-s-international-development-finance-corporation-respond-covid-19-outbreak under the Defense Production Act.
DFC and the Defense Department agreed https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2227560/dod-partners-with-dfc-to-protect-industrial-base-from-economic-effect-of-pandem on Monday to jointly administer $100 million in supply-chain reshoring funds from the $2.3 billion coronavirus legislation passed in March.
Company proposals to reshore are already pouring in, Boehler said.
""The areas that have come on hot right away are on the PPE side and within the pharmaceutical value chains,"" Boehler said, adding there was interest in returning some generic drug production - almost all of which is imported - to the United States.
The $100 million can be leveraged into ""tens of billions of dollars"" in loans by using it as a pool of capital similar to the U.S. Treasury s backing of Federal Reserve loan facilities, Boehler said. At that scale, the agency could participate in the financing of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd s (TW:2330) planned factory in Arizona.
The project is a centerpiece of the push to wrestle global technology supply chains back from China. TSMC, the world s largest contract chipmaker, is a major supplier to Apple Inc ,  Qualcomm Inc   and other major U.S. tech firms.
""We provide loan and investment financing, so could we be relevant there? Absolutely. We re talking tens of billions of dollars in potential here, so that s a possibility, I wouldn t exclude that,"" Boehler said.
A financing package for TSMC would likely include private capital from the state of Arizona. It is too soon to say whether the agency would be able to participate.
 FOOT ON THE GAS 
DFC was created under 2018 legislation that combined the former Overseas Private Investment Corp (OPIC) and part of the U.S. Agency for International Development, more than doubling OPIC s overall lending and investment capacity to $60 billion. Its planned October 2019 launch was delayed until January by a budget fight in Congress that threatened a government shutdown.
Boehler said DFC s development mission would not be affected by Trump s executive order and would keep its ""foot on the gas"" to accelerate projects in poor countries.
The 337-employee DFC - small for a federal agency - is adding about 15 people to focus solely on the domestic reshoring projects, he said, and the funding for overseas development will be kept separate.
The agency approved https://www.dfc.gov/media/press-releases/dfc-approves-1-billion-investments-global-development $1 billion worth of investments and loans at its June board meeting, including a $200 million loan to Guatemala s Banco Industrial to expand lending to small and medium-size enterprises. Boehler said the bank s board in September would consider a larger slate of projects."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Wednesday, consolidating after recent strong gains while investors fret about the potential for a second wave of the Covid-19 virus.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 19 points, or 0.6%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 33 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Futures contract fell 197 points, or 0.8%. 
Wall Street has powered higher since the lows in March, helped by extraordinary levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, and by signs of recovery as the economy reopens.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has led the way, gaining for the last eight sessions to post a record high. It s on course for its best quarter since the fourth quarter of 1999, the height of the dot-com bubble.
The other senior indices are also posting gains. The DJIA is set for its best quarter since the first quarter of 1998 and the S&P 500 its best since the first quarter of 1975.
That s happening even though the U.S. has now confirmed more than 2.3 million Covid-19 cases and over 121,000 related deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, while several U.S. states are seeing record numbers of infections. Covid cases are growing by 5% or more in 26 of the 50 states.
The latest rise in new infections may prompt EU nations to close their borders to U.S. travelers as they seek to reopen their economies to tourism, the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing unnamed European officials.
Adding to Wednesday’s worries, the United States is considering tariffs on $3.1 billion of exports from the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany, Bloomberg news reported, citing a notice published by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. This could prompt a tit-for-tat trade war, subduing economic growth.
Economic data releases are thin on the ground in the U.S. Wednesday, but signs of recovery continued in Europe as German business morale surged in June, posting the biggest rise since records started after reunification in 1990.
The International Monetary Fund will later update its forecasts for the global economy in an update of its World Economic Outlook.
In corporate news, tech giants will remain in focus, with the likes of Apple , Amazon  and Netflix  hitting fresh highs as home-bound consumers have turned to the internet and streaming services to keep busy during lockdowns.
Oil turned lower Wednesday, with investors worrying about a second consecutive week of increases in the crude oil supply.
The American Petroleum Institute estimated a large build of 1.749 million barrels for the week ended June 19 late Tuesday, much bigger than expected. Attention now turns to the government figures due at 8:30 AM ET, where a small build is expected.
By 2:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% lower at $39.59 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.7% to $41.92.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,792.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1305, flat on the day.

Investing.com --  U.S. stock markets fell at the opening on Wednesday, as a rise in new coronavirus infections across most of the country revived the threat of restrictive measures to contain a disease that has never really gone away. 
California, Texas and Florida - three of the four most populous and economically important states in the country -- have all reported record numbers of infections this week.
The mood wasn t helped by a reminder from the International Monetary Fund that the problem still exists far beyond the U.S.: the Fund slashed its outlook for the world economy this year to show a 4.9% contraction, rather than the 3.0% it had forecast in the immediate aftermath of lockdowns across China, Europe and the U.S.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 288 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite - home to the  growth  stocks that have been investors  preferred sanctuary during bouts of market negativity this year, was clearly outperforming with a loss of only 0.3%.
However, that Nasdaq rally is looking suspiciously narrow to some. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  , highlighted via Twitter that the proportion of stocks in the Nasdaq trading above their 200-day moving averages is only 45%, compared to around 60% for the first half of the Trump presidency, and compared to around 80% during the earlier stages of the rally after 2009.  That implies that traders are betting increasingly on a narrow selection of heavyweight stocks such as the FAANG megacaps and Microsoft , all of which posted all-time highs on Tuesday. 
Apple , Microsoft and Netflix  all gave up between 0.5% and 1.0% in early trading, Apple being not unduly concerned by an Axios report that the Department of Justice is preparing to announce an antitrust investigation into possible abuse of the App Store (mirroring an EU investigation announced earlier this month). Facebook  stock was the biggest loser among the megacaps, losing 2.6% after Unilever  unit Ben & Jerry s joined a growing list of advertizers to boycott the group s two big social networks over its hands-off approach to inflammatory political opinion.
Cyclical stocks - notably cruise lines - were harder hit, with Carnival  stock, Norwegian Cruise Line  stock and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises  stock all falling over 9% on fears that a resurgence of the virus will push back even further the date when they can resume sailing. 
The biggest gainers in early trading included Dell Technologies  stock and VMware  stock. after The Wall Street Journal reported that founder Michael Dell is considering another reshuffle of his portfolio. The options under consideration include a partial sale of Dell s 81% stake in VMWare, as well as a complete buyout, the WSJ reported.
Elsewhere, Crude Oil futures fell 2.2% to $39.76 a barrel amid renewed Covid-19-driven fears for the demand outlook, while Gold Futures recovered earlier losses to trade down 0.1% at $1,780 a troy ounce."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple , Cisco  and Dell products are among the goods from U.S. companies being caught up in India s border tensions with China, as Indian ports hold up imports from China, two sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
Though no government notice has been issued, customs officers at major Indian port have held back containers coming from China, seeking additional clearances, government and industry sources have said.
The move comes amid heightened tensions between India and China after border clashes last week that saw at least 20 Indian soldiers killed.
The U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a lobby group representing U.S. firms, told India s commerce ministry in a letter dated June 23 that lack of clarity and delays could disrupt business and manufacturing operations.
""Authorities have abruptly halted the clearance of industry consignments coming in from China (and perhaps other destinations) at most major ports and airports,"" USISPF said in the letter, seen by Reuters.
""This will send a chilling signal to foreign investors who look for predictability and transparency,"" it said.
The commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
Two industry sources said Apple, Cisco, Dell and Ford Motor  Co products were among those held up. Electronics components of Taiwan s Foxconn, a contract manufacturer for Apple in India, were also affected, a third source said. 
It was not immediately clear which ports were holding back the goods.
Apple, Cisco and Foxconn did not respond to requests for comment. A Dell spokeswoman declined to comment, while Ford said a consignment of auto parts was held up at a port in the southern city of Chennai and the company was providing information sought by the authorities.
The delays come as India is restarting factory operations after a nationwide lockdown to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.
Indian electronics and mobile industry group ICEA said its members had been told Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi Airports would have a new examination procedure for all consignments coming from China.
Normally, goods for regular importers are cleared automatically, ICEA said in a letter to the finance ministry, urging it to intervene.

India s finance ministry, which oversees the customs department, did not respond to a request for comment."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Having pulled ahead in the race to develop a software-based vehicle operating system, U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla  faces a new challenge from an alliance of German luxury carmaker Daimler  and U.S. computer graphics specialist Nvidia .
Daimler and Nvidia unveiled a deal on Tuesday to develop and equip the German company s Mercedes-Benz cars with a next-generation chip and software platform that could eventually be used to help vehicles drive by themselves. 
The move is a response to Tesla s ability to integrate custom designed chips with thousands of lines of code, which has allowed the Silicon Valley-based company to develop new features faster than its competitors. 
While Daimler and German rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW have criticised Tesla s aggressive marketing of its ""autopilot"" features, they have struggled to match the speed with which the U.S. carmaker brings innovations to market. 
Thanks to instantly upgradeable software, Tesla s cars boast a longer operating range and more entertainment options than rivals, even as it struggles to ramp up production. According to Volkswagen, Tesla is a decade ahead of the competition.
In a bid to narrow the gap, Mercedes, the world s oldest carmaker, has taken the unprecedented step of sharing its intellectual property with an outside tech company in exchange for access to Nvidia s computer processors and its software engineers specialised in artificial intelligence.
That s a big change from established automakers  traditional approach of trying to go it alone, or partnering with existing suppliers and manufacturers, and marks an attempt to keep up with Tesla, and deep-pocketed tech firms like Amazon  and Apple .
Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi have so far used a patchwork approach, combining vehicle platforms originally designed for combustion engine drives with electric vehicle software and components largely developed by third party suppliers.
Rather than designing a new vehicle from the ground up, German carmakers have attempted to stitch together software from suppliers of camera and radar sensors, which has made it harder to upgrade their vehicles than if they had used a comprehensive, upgradeable vehicle operating system. 
Software and processing power is gaining in importance thanks to automated driving, which requires radar, ultrasonic, camera and lidar sensors to talk to each other as well as to manage competing demands for battery power.
With zero-emission cars, electricity is not just consumed through acceleration, but also by cooling the battery, running air conditioners, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, image recognition and semi-autonomous driving functions. 
CATCHING UP 
Although Tesla started out with a similar patchwork approach, it has since adopted a strategy akin to Apple with its iPhone - it now designs computer chips and software in-house.
Like Apple, Tesla has redefined the way technologies are packaged, leaving analysts wondering whether the car sector will follow the phone industry, where profits moved from device manufacturer to producers of high-tech components and software. 
Spooked by Tesla s advance, German carmakers and major supplier Robert Bosch are retooling their businesses to accommodate ""software first"" operating systems, which rely on fewer, more powerful chips and computers. 
But they face a battle to catch up. 
Traditional carmakers have struggled to attract software engineering talent, in part because of a reticence to pay big salaries for projects without a defined business case, allowing Tesla to sustain an advantage which some analysts say is getting bigger thanks to the company s ""fleet learning."" 
Tesla collects data about battery depletion rates and driving styles from all its cars, and uses this to design new software algorithms. 
Prioritising energy consumption has allowed Tesla keep battery capacity above 90% even after 200,000-300,000 kilometres, or four to five years, UBS analysts said in a March 2019 report, attributing this to Tesla-designed software, batteries and semiconductors.
Teaming up with Nvidia could allow Daimler to take a short cut to state-of-the-art technology. 
The results won t be immediate - jointly developed Mercedes-Nvidia vehicles are not expected to hit the road until 2024. Nvidia will help Daimler develop assisted and self-driving functions, which will form part of a Mercedes-designed overall vehicle system.
Chips and processors will only become more critical as automakers race to build self-driving cars. Just one video sensor, such as Bosch’s stereo video camera, generates 100 gigabytes of data in only one kilometre of travel, making efficient processing vital to optimising vehicle range and training vehicle reflexes. 
That makes fewer, more powerful processors a must, according to Harry Kroeger, a former head of development of electronics at Daimler, a former director of Tesla and now a management board member at Bosch overseeing automotive electronics. 
""You no longer install one small box for every single function; instead you install a bigger smart box that can do many things simultaneously,” he said. 

""The computing power you need for climate control is ridiculously low compared to functions that prevent the car from crashing. A smart box prioritises the safety functions and uses its  down time  to focus on things like climate regulation."" "

Other states have also suggested that restrictions could be reimposed to contain the outbreak.  
California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was prepared to reimpose stringent coronavirus restrictions to contain the surge in infections in the state, which reported more than 5,000 new cases on Tuesday, the highest number reported in a single day since the pandemic began.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks finally succumbed to investor worries about a second wave of coronavirus cases after managing to shrug off concerns earlier in the week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 700 points on Wednesday, and tech giants could not maintain their record-setting pace.
Businesses across the U.S. are trying to reopen even though new hotspots continue to pop up. That has led to worries that the progress will be interrupted by a fresh round of Covid-19 shutdowns. Already, Apple  has been forced to reclose some of its retail stores, announcing the shuttering of seven stores in the Houston area beginning Thursday.
Restaurant groups, retailers, and travel and leisure stocks could feel more pain if new shutdowns are ordered. And the oil sector, which has staged a comeback from a sharp drop in demand in March and April, is feeling pressure because of the slow pace of recovery.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Earnings Reports Show Uneven Effect of Covid-19 Shutdowns
Darden Restaurants Inc , which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, is scheduled to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings Thursday before the opening bell. It s already a bleak outlook, with analysts tracked by Investing.com looking for a loss of $1.71 a share on revenue of $1.2 billion.
Meanwhile, sports apparel maker  Nike  Inc  is set to report fourth quarter earnings after the closing bell, and analysts are expecting earnings of 12 cents a share on revenue of $7.4 billion.
2. Oil Sector in Spotlight After Mixed Data
Crude Oil WTI Futuresfell more nearly 6% on Wednesday after the government said crude stockpiles rose more than expected. At the same time, production also showed a surprising gain, indicating shale producers are back at work with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, trading around $38 a barrel.
Energy has been the worst performing sector of the S&P 500 this year despite staging a comeback since March and April, when demand for oil and oil products plummeted because of Covid-19 business shutdowns. Oil s sell-off on Wednesday also pressured shares of big oil companies such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp  and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) B PLC (NYSE:RDSb).
3. Investors Watch for the Trend in Jobless Claims
Also on Thursday, the government will report its weekly unemployment numbers. The progress has been good, but unemployment is still at post World War II highs. Initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21 are expected to be 1.3 million, while continuing jobless claims are expected to be 19.9 million. Both would be down from the number of claims filed the prior week.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Thursday after Wednesday’s sharp losses, with investors showing caution amid signs that cases of the COVID-19 pandemic are accelerating, hampering efforts to reopen the country’s economy.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.3%, lower, Nasdaq Futures up 3 points, or 0.1%. The Dow Futures contract rose 107 points, or 0.4%. 
Wall Street closed sharply lower Wednesday, amid worries that rising Covid-19 infections could slow the reopening of businesses in many states, hitting the pace of the country’s economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.7%, or 710 points, the S&P 500 slipped 2.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.2%, snapping an eight-day winning streak. This was the worst day for Wall Street in two weeks.
More than half of all U.S. states are reporting rises in new coronavirus cases, and the country as a whole recorded Wednesday a one-day total of nearly 35,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, the highest level since late April. 
This has prompted the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where the rate of infections has slowed after being particularly hard hit, to require visitors from states with increasing numbers of infections to self-isolate for 14 days.
With this in mind, attention will turn to the release of the weekly employment data. Initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21 are expected to be 1.3 million, while continuing jobless claims are expected to be 19.9 million. weekly unemployment numbers. Recent progress has been good, but unemployment is still at post World War II highs. 
Durable goods numbers for May and the first quarter GDP release are also due Thursday, but these are seen as more backward looking data points.
In corporate news, Walt  Disney   will be in the spotlight after delaying the re-opening of theme parks and resorts in California because of the increase in Covid-19 cases. The Wall Street Journal also reported that the entertainment giant is considering holding back the release of its “Mulan” movie.
Apple  would also be in focus after saying it would shut seven stories in the Houston area following a sharp rise in cases, after last week reclosing some locations in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
Meanwhile, sports apparel maker  Nike   is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell, and analysts are expecting earnings of 12 cents a share on revenue of $7.4 billion.
Oil weakened Thursday, extending the previous session’s substantial losses as record high U.S. crude inventories revived fears of a supply glut amid concerns about a hit to fuel demand from a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $37.55 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.7% to $40.01.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,771.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1208, down 0.4%."

New York (Reuters) - Wall Street s main indexes closed higher in choppy trading on Thursday, with bank stocks soaring ahead of annual stress test results and helping to offset investor jitters over alarming increases in new coronavirus cases.
The recently battered S&P 500 banks sub-index led the gainers for the session after U.S. banking regulators eased rules and investors waited for results of the sector s annual stress test, which helps determine dividend policies.
The bank index had fallen 19 percent from its recent high on June 5 to Wednesday s lowest point. It closed up 3.6% on Thursday.
But investors remained nervous throughout the day as the number of new virus cases in U.S. states grew, especially in the West and South. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he was halting his state s phased economic reopening in response to a jump in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations.
And stocks wobbled temporarily late in the session after Apple Inc  said it would close 14 stores in Florida again due to rising COVID-19 cases after other re-closures in Houston, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
A flare-up in virus cases in recent days has taken some wind out of a Wall Street rally powered by hopes of a quick economic recovery and massive government stimulus efforts. However, the benchmark S&P 500 still closed less than 9% below its Feb. 19 record.
While bank stocks provided one of the biggest boosts on Thursday, Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, said investors were buying the dip after a pullback in stocks on Wednesday.
""None of those issues that caused yesterday s weakness were really resolved today,"" said James. ""You could argue that the market could be a fair amount lower. The reason we re not is there is still some understanding that things are going to have a brighter ending at some point.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 299.66 points, or 1.18%, to 25,745.6, the S&P 500 gained 33.43 points, or 1.10%, to 3,083.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.84 points, or 1.09%, to 10,017.00.
All the three major indexes had opened Thursday s session lower after data showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell less than expected last week, likely as hiring by reopening businesses is being partly offset by a second wave of layoffs.
But the S&P s financial sector, up 2.7%, stayed strong for the session and was the S&P s top percentage gainer. Earlier, regulators had unveiled two rules easing restrictions covering large banks with complex trading and investment portfolios.. 
The Federal Reserve was due to release results of annual bank stress tests after the markets close, potentially indicating how much flexibility banks will have to return capital to shareholders. 
""The risk-reward bias favors a more positive bias into the results this evening because the sector has been such a laggard,"" said Wedbush s James.

Investing.com -- Bank stocks whipsawed Thursday, surging during the day but falling after hours as coronavirus infections increased across the U.S. and the Federal Reserve released its stress test statement. The Dow was up almost 300 points to 25,744.71, reversing earlier losses. 
Texas reversed plans to reopen after Houston’s intensive-care units reached maximum capacity, while California, Arizona and Florida each saw a surge in new Covid-19 infections. Electives surgeries in Texas s biggest cities have been suspended. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom also declared a budget emergency because of Covid-19 and Disney s delaying its July 17 reopening of Disneyland. And more bad news: Macy’s is laying off 3,900 corporate employees, the government sent $1.4 billion in stimulus checks to dead people and unemployment came in above 1 million for the 14th week in a row. Still, the Nasdaq rose for a ninth day in a row. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Banks, Banks and More Banks
Banks from  Citigroup   to Bank of America  led the charge today, surging thanks to the loosening of the Volcker Rule, which will allow for riskier trades and investments in private equity and hedge funds. The easing of financial crisis-era rules on trading activities, including relaxing margin requirements for certain types of trades, should free up capital.
But after the market close, bank stocks fell on the results of the Fed s annual regulatory stress test. Share repurchases have been suspended for the third quarter and bank dividend payments will be capped at their current levels, with payouts based on a bank s recent earnings. Banks have to reassess their capital plans and may face another stress test later this year, the Fed said in announcing the results of its annual stress tests.
The Federal Reserve s annual stress test of big banks, which started in 2009, is supposed to show what happens to their balance sheets – in terms of losses and capital levels – under an extreme hypothetical scenario. The results give regulators a sense of whether a bank s plan to pay dividends and buy back shares will still leave enough of a buffer behind for it to endure a crisis.
2. U.S. Personal Income & Spending
Personal income in May is expected to have declined by 6% compared to a jump of 10% for the previous month as stimulus checks run out, according to Bloomberg. Spending figures may show increased spending of 9% compared to a 14% retraction in April as some U.S. states started to reopen. Congress may approve a second round of stimulus checks in July.
3. Covid-19 Shuttering Economy, Again
With infections surging in swaths of the U.S., states are closing back down and any personal spending bump from May is likely to come back down. Apple  closed 14 stores in Florida. Darden Restaurants Inc . was one of the few big bright spots in the market today, with CEO Gene Lee shrugging off the impacts of the virus saying it hasn’t had much of an effect on business, but the company’s keeping an eye on the new rise in infections.
 Yelp   reported that of the 140,000 closures of the businesses on its app since March, 41% are permanent closures. The company also noted that diners had been returning to restaurants in June, as well as malls and wellness centers, like spas.
Why are markets stable amid increasing infection rates? BlackRock  CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that the world is more accepting of higher coronavirus rates."

LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) - The governor of Texas temporarily halted the state s reopening on Thursday as COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations surged and the country set a new record for a one-day increase in cases. 
Texas, which has been at the forefront of efforts to reopen devastated economies shut down in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, has seen one of the biggest jumps in new cases, reporting more than 6,000 in a single day on Monday. 
""This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business,"" Governor Greg Abbott, a two-term Republican, said in a statement.
Texas has also set record hospitalizations for 13 days in a row. Abbott has suspended elective surgeries in the Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio areas to free up hospital bed space.
Texas  rising numbers are part of a nationwide resurgence in states that were spared the brunt of the initial outbreak or moved early to lift restrictions on residents and businesses. 
Cases rose across the United States by at least 39,818 on Thursday, the largest one-day increase of the pandemic. 
More than 36,000 new U.S. cases were recorded on Wednesday, a few hundred shy of the record 36,426 on April 24.
Also reporting record rises in cases this week were Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming.
While some of the increased numbers of cases can be attributed to more testing, the percentage of positive results is also climbing. 
The Trump administration has tried to soften nationwide concerns about the pandemic even as a dozen or so states see worrisome increases.
""We re working aggressively with states and local leaders in this situation but it s important for the American people to know this is a localized situation,"" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News in an interview. ""The counties that are in hotspots are 3% of American counties."" 
Government experts believe more than 20 million Americans could have contracted the coronavirus, 10 times more than official counts, indicating many people without symptoms have or have had the disease, senior administration officials said.
People who have COVID-19 but show no symptoms are capable of spreading the disease, health experts say.
PANDEMIC SHIFTS TO SOUTH, WEST
The focus of the pandemic has moved to the U.S. West and South, including more sparsely populated rural areas, from the early epicenter around New York, where more than 31,000 deaths have been recorded, more than a quarter of the country s total.
Oregon and Utah have also paused or slowed lifting the restrictions. 
In California, Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, declared a budget emergency due to the pandemic.
Nearly 5,350 people tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, fewer than Wednesday’s record of 7,149. But the number of Californians becoming very ill continued to rise, using about 34% of the available intensive care beds in the state, up from 29% on Wednesday.
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday ordered travelers from eight mostly Southern states, as well as tri-state residents returning from those areas, to self-quarantine for two weeks on arrival.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that New York reached a new milestone as the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 fell to 996, the first time since March 18 the number fell below 1,000. 
Cuomo, a Democrat who has been sharply critical of President Donald Trump s handling of the pandemic, during an interview on CNN appeared to blame Trump and other Republicans for the surges in other states.
""You played politics with this virus and you lost,"" Cuomo said on CNN. 
Apple Inc  said on Thursday it would close 14 stores in Florida due to the rise in coronavirus cases, following an earlier round of re-closures in Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina and South Carolina.
Shares of Walt  Disney  Co  fell 2% on Thursday after it delayed the reopening of California theme parks and resorts until it receives approval from state officials. Disney s stock price made back much of that loss in later trading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is seeking the final documents to complete an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc s Google , said three sources familiar with the probe, which is expected to end with a lawsuit this summer.
State attorneys general have separate probes into Google, and the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has ongoing investigations into Google, Amazon.com Inc ,  Facebook Inc   and Apple Inc .
The department has requested information by the end of June from companies concerned about Google s abuse of its advertising clout, as well as those with data that could be used to support a complaint against Google, the sources said, noting that the deadline could be extended. 
They did not say what the complaint would allege.
Justice Department officials and some state attorneys general will hold a virtual meeting on Friday to discuss the probe, a person briefed on the matter said.
Google, which provides free web searches, email and other services, makes money through advertising. Google controls a third of the world s online ad spending but 90% of the market for some ad tech tools. This includes Google Ad Manager, software that publishers use to sell space for display ads.
Google has also been accused of abusing its dominance of Android, its smartphone operating system. Platforms such as  Yelp   say Google favors its own products in search results.
The Justice Department declined to comment. Google had no immediate comment.
The dozens of state attorneys general led by Texas which are also investigating Google will certainly be asked to join the federal lawsuit, and many will likely do so, one of the sources said.
""They re not joined at the hip but there is a lot more coordination,"" the source said.
Google s defenders, like Washington-based tech trade group NetChoice whose members include Alphabet, say digital ad prices have fallen sharply in the past decade as competition has increased. 
The state attorneys general focusing on Google are considering going after the company for privacy lapses by using statutes that bar deceptive practices, according to one source.
State laws barring unfair and deceptive practices can be interpreted broadly and sometimes carry heavy financial penalties, especially if the number of violations is large. Arizona and New Mexico already have sued Google over allegedly deceptive privacy practices this year, seeking $10,000 and $5,000 respectively per violation of their state statutes.
The government s probes of Google bear striking similarities to its probe of  Microsoft Corp   in the 1990s when it provided the dominant operating system. Like Microsoft, Google was first investigated by the Federal Trade Commission. In both instances, the Justice Department and the states then began their probes.

The Justice Department won a trial against Microsoft in 1998 which was overturned on appeal and remanded. The two sides settled in 2001."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Austrian sensor producer  AMS    is poised to get the go-ahead from the European Union for its acquisition of German lighting group Osram (DE:OSRn), three people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Osram is a leading maker of car headlights with close ties to carmakers and AMS hopes to combine that with its expertise in sensors to develop packaged solutions for self-driving cars.
AMS supplies Apple  with sensors for its iPhones and the Osram acquisition, its largest ever, will also help it reduce its dependence on the U.S. firm, its biggest customer.
EU competition enforcers do not see any concerns as the two companies have few overlapping businesses and the merger is expected to get unconditional antitrust clearance, the people said.

The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by July 6, declined to comment. AMS was not immediately available for comment."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to chief executives of five large tech companies asking them to ensure social media platforms are not used to incite violence in the wake of nationwide protests following George Floyd s death.
""I am writing to ask you to do your part to put an end to violence and illegal activity spreading across our country by ensuring that your platforms are not used as a tool to organize, facilitate, or incite dangerous or deadly riots, in violation of state and local laws,"" Acting Secretary Chad Wolf said in the letter.
Wolf said the department supports First Amendment rights that allow citizens to freely express themselves but cautioned against social media being weaponized to perpetuate criminal activity.
""The misuse of social media platforms to coordinate criminal acts threatens the safety and security of our nation,"" Wolf wrote, adding: ""the department supports the powerful voice that social media provides to its users.""
He asked Facebook , Twitter, Alphabet  s Google, Snapchat and Apple  to help end information sharing on how to break city curfews, which stores or neighborhoods to target for looting or destruction, and for the coordination of attacks against particular people or groups of people.
The June 25 letter, first reported by the Washington Post, comes as the administration of President Donald Trump has begun targeting people for vandalizing monuments and statues during protests against racial inequality.
Twitter said it would respond to the letter. Snapchat, Apple and Facebook did not comment while Google did not immediately respond.
Some firms have taken action after tweets from Trump himself.
Snapchat this month stopped promoting Trump s account on its Discover page in early June after his statement threatening protesters with ""vicious dogs and ominous weapons.""

Twitter this week placed a warning notice on a Trump tweet threatening “serious force” against protesters in the U.S. capital, the second time it used the label."

Investing.com -- The FAANG stocks have had a good coronavirus crisis, but investors should start thinking about whether these gains can continue. Peter Nurse argues that the group is behaving like the dotcom s in 1999, before the bursting of that first internet bubble. Yasin Ebrahim makes the case that the group offers investors a chance to buy the dip amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus lockdowns. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bear Case
While the U.S. economy has struggled to recover from the mass unemployment and output collapse caused by the social distancing measures used to combat the virus, Wall Street has bounced back strongly from the initial crash, powered by all-powerful tech stocks.
Facebook , Apple , Amazon , Microsoft , Alphabet , or the so-called Fab 5, making up 40% of the Nasdaq Composite Index, have shown to be big winners when the world goes into lockdown.
Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Netflix  have all hit record highs this month, while Google owner Alphabet isn t far removed.
These stocks now have a combined market capitalization of over $4.7 trillion, meaning the market cap of the Nasdaq Composite is concentrated in the five largest stocks to a degree not witnessed since the peak of the Tech bubble at the turn of the century.
“The market has favoured these companies and they have been flavour of the month since the Covid pandemic erupted,” said Zehrid Osmani at Legg Mason affiliate Martin Currie. “The risk now is that these obvious beneficiaries of lockdown have been bid up a lot, and now it’s a question of what is in the price going forward.”
And they are starting to look expensive.
For example, Netflix is currently trading on a price/earnings ratio of around 94, which compares with 78.35 at the end of last year when the Covid-19 outbreak was not a consideration in any investors’ thought process. Amazon’s current P/E stands around 131, versus 80.31; Apple above 28, versus 23.20 and so on.
These companies are also all now facing a number of pressing fundamental issues.
Amazon and Google face the hard stare of regulatory scrutiny for possible anti-competitive business practices. Netflix is competing with a number of new rivals in streaming video as well as having to cope with the extremely expensive business of producing new content.
European competition officials have already announced investigations into both Apple’s App Store and its payment platform, Apple Pay, while the U.S. Department of Justice has long been rumoured to be on the verge of doing something similar.
Facebook and Google have already had to cope with a sharp drop in advertising spending during the coronavirus pandemic, and are going to have to compete with the major broadcasters for likely reduced advertising budgets going forward.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that U.S. advertising spending is expected to plunge by 13% this year, according to research from GroupM, a unit of advertising giant WPP  PLC. It was only in December it was forecasting U.S. ad spending would rise by 4% in 2020.
The social media companies, including Facebook, have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order to roll back their legal protections after accusing them of trying to silence conservative voices.
On the flip side, Verizon  announced Thursday it was pulling its advertising from Facebook, the biggest name so far in a growing movement to boycott the social network for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms.
On top of this, Facebook and Google have been criticized for lack of data privacy and security.
Despite their valuations increasing during the crisis, the profits at the tech giants have actually fallen along with the rest of the market, said Societe Generale’s ultra-bear Albert Edwards in a research note late last month, and unless a cyclical recovery is on the cards this is set to continue.
“I personally suspect that this recession will ultimately expose these and the tech sector to be far more cyclical than appreciated. And it will be difficult in that environment to maintain their 32x forward PE,” Edwards added."

965,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-uschina-feud-quietly-gets-nasty-2214604,2020-06-28,The U.S.-China Feud Quietly Gets Nasty By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China are moving beyond bellicose trade threats to exchanging regulatory punches that threaten a wide range of industries including technology, energy and air travel.
The two countries have blacklisted each other’s companies, barred flights and expelled journalists. The quietly unfolding skirmish is starting to make companies nervous the trading landscape could shift out from under them.
“There are many industries where U.S. companies have made long-term bets on China’s future because the market is so promising and so big,” said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s head of international affairs. Now, they’re “recognizing the risk.”
China will look to avoid measures that could backfire, said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to the nation’s cabinet and a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. Any sanctions on U.S. companies would be a “last resort” because China “is in desperate need of foreign investment from rich countries for both economic and political reasons.”
Pressure is only expected to intensify ahead of the U.S. elections in November, as President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden joust over who will take a tougher line on China.
Trump has blamed China for covering up the coronavirus pandemic he has mocked as “Kung Flu,” accused Beijing of “illicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets” and threatened the U.S. could pursue a “complete decoupling” from the country.
Biden, likewise, has described President Xi Jinping as a thug, labeled mass detention of Uighur Muslims as unconscionable and accused China of predatory trade practices.
And on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats have found rare unity in their opposition to China, with lawmakers eager to take action against Beijing for its handling of Covid-19, forced technology transfers, human rights abuses and its tightening grip on Hong Kong.
“China is going to be a punching bag in the campaign,” said Capital Alpha Partners’ Byron Callan. “But China is a punching bag that can punch back.”
China has repeatedly rejected U.S. accusations over its handling of the pandemic, Uighurs, Hong Kong and trade, and it has fired back at the Trump administration for undermining global cooperation and seeking to start a “new cold war.” Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month said China has no interest in replacing the U.S. as a hegemonic power, while adding that the U.S. should give up its “wishful thinking” of changing China.
Both countries have already taken a series of regulatory moves aimed at protecting market share.
The U.S. is citing security concerns in blocking China Mobile  Ltd., the world’s largest mobile operator, from entering the U.S. market. It’s culling Chinese-made drones from government fleets and discouraging the deployment of Chinese transformers on the power grid. The Trump administration has also tried to constrain the global reach of China’s Huawei Technologies Co., the world’s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer.
Meanwhile, China prevented U.S. airline flights into the country for more than two months and, after the U.S. imposed visa restrictions on Chinese journalists, it expelled American journalists. It has stepped up its scrutiny of U.S. companies, with China’s state news agency casting one probe as a warning to the White House. China also has long made it difficult for U.S. telecommunications companies to enter its market, requiring overseas operators to co-invest with local firms and requiring authorization by the central government.
One of the most combustible flashpoints has been the Trump administration’s campaign to contain Huawei by seeking to limit the company’s business in the U.S. and push allies to shun its gear in their networks.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission moved to block devices made by Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763). from being used in U.S. networks. And the Commerce Department has placed Huawei on blacklists aimed at preventing the Chinese company from using U.S. technology for the chips that power its network gear, including tech from suppliers Qualcomm  Inc. and Broadcom  Inc.
After suppliers found work-arounds, Commerce in May tightened rules to bar any chipmaker using American equipment from selling to Huawei without U.S. approval. The step could constrain virtually the entire contract chipmaking industry, which uses equipment from U.S. vendors such as Applied Materials Inc .,  Lam Research Corp  . and KLA Corp. in wafer fabrication plants. The curbs also threaten to cripple Huawei. Although the company can buy off-the-shelf or commodity mobile chips from a third party such as Samsung Electronics  Co. or MediaTek Inc., going that route would force it to make costly compromises on performance in basic products.
Huawei was on a list the Pentagon unveiled last week of companies it says are owned or controlled by China’s military, opening them to increased scrutiny.
China has raised the specter of reprisal.
After the new restrictions were announced, the editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper tweeted that China would retaliate using an “unreliable entities list” that it first threatened at the height of the trade war last year. Although China didn’t identify companies on the list, the Global Times has cited a source close to the Chinese government as saying U.S. bellwethers such as Apple Inc . and Qualcomm could be targeted.
The fallout could extend to companies heavily reliant on Chinese supply chains, as well consumer-facing brands eager to expand sales in Asia. Boeing  Co., which recorded $5.7 billion of revenue from China in 2019, and Tesla  Inc., the biggest U.S. carmaker operating independently in China, are among companies most exposed if relations sour further.
“We’re playing in a much wider field now,” said Jim Lucier, managing director of research firm Capital Alpha Partners. “We’re not simply talking about ‘you tariff me’ and ‘I tariff you.’ The playing field is virtually unlimited.”
Planes and Automobiles
U.S. automakers have also been singed. In June, China fined Ford Motor  Co.’s main joint venture in the country for antitrust violations, saying Changan Ford Automobile Co. had restricted retailers’ sale prices since 2013.
Aviation has been another source of tension, as both countries squabble over access to their skies. China’s decision to limit U.S. airlines operations to those services scheduled as of March 12 hurt carriers such as United Airlines Holdings  Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc , and American Airlines  Group Inc. that had suspended passenger flights to and from China because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. responded earlier this month by initially threatening to ban all flights from China, then relenting to allow two flights weekly once Chinese officials eased their restrictions. Now, in what appears to be a staged de-escalation, China gave U.S. passenger carriers permission to operate four weekly flights to the country and earlier this month, the Trump administration matched the move by also authorizing four flights from Chinese airlines.
It’s happening outside of aviation too. Consider the U.S. government’s decision to seize a half-ton, Chinese-made electrical transformer when it arrived at an American port last year and divert the gear to a national lab instead of the Colorado substation where it was supposed to be deployed. That move -- and a May executive order from Trump authorizing the blockade of electric grid gear supplied by “foreign adversaries” of the U.S. in the name of national security -- have already sent shock waves through the power sector.
The effect has been to dissuade American utilities from buying Chinese equipment to replace aging components in the nation’s electrical grid, said Jim Cai, the U.S. representative for Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Co., the company whose delivery was seized. Although Cai said the firm has supplied parts to private utilities and government-run grid operators in the U.S. for nearly 15 years without security complaints, at least one American utility has since canceled a transformer award to the company, Cai said.
Trump’s directive is tied to a broader effort to bring more manufacturing to the U.S. from China. “This is a part of the administration’s efforts to impair China’s supply chains into the United States,” said former White House adviser Mike McKenna.
Escalating tensions could jeopardize the U.S. economic recovery as well as China’s trade commitment to purchase $200 billion in American goods and services. Trump declared on Twitter last week that the pact “is fully intact,” adding: “Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!”Last week, Trump tweeted “The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!”
It may also affect the November presidential election. Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton alleges in a new book that Trump asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping to help him win re-election by buying more farm products -- a claim the White House has dismissed as untrue.
“I don’t expect one single blow to send this relationship in a tailspin,” the chamber’s Brilliant said. “Each side will calibrate their reactions in a way that will not tip the scales too far.”
Take the recent spat over media access. After the U.S. designated five Chinese media companies as “foreign missions,” China revoked press credentials for three Wall Street Journal staff members over an article with a headline describing China as the “real sick man of Asia.”
Then the Trump administration ordered Chinese state-owned news outlets to slash staff working in the U.S. Beijing responded in March by effectively expelling more than a dozen U.S. journalists working in China.
Both the U.S. and China have ample opportunities to ratchet up regulatory pressure. A bill passed by the Senate last month could prompt the delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges if American officials aren’t allowed to review their financial audits.
And last week, as the U.S. State Department imposed visa bans on Chinese Communist Party officials accused of infringing the freedom of Hong Kong citizens, a senior official made clear the move was just an opening salvo in a campaign to force Beijing to back off new restrictions on the city.
China, similarly, can slow licensing decisions and regulatory approvals, launch investigations under its anti-monopoly law and squeeze financial firms that want to do business in the country. For instance, the country could rescind pledges to let U.S. financial firms take controlling stakes in Chinese investment banking joint ventures, according to a Cowen analyst.
“China will not make any significant compromise and will retaliate whenever and wherever possible,” Shi, the Renmin University professor, said.
Companies are still lured to China and its massive local market -- and tensions with the U.S. don’t overcome the Asian superpower’s appeal. Just one-fifth of companies surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce in China late last year said they had moved or were considering moving some operations outside of the country, part of a three-year downward trend.
But the coronavirus pandemic has subsequently pushed more companies to reckon with the risks of relying too heavily on any single country for their supply chains, amid existing concerns about forced technology transfers, cost and rising tensions that could damp investment in China.
China is no longer the lowest-cost manufacturer, and companies are more reluctant to invest there, said James Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“Everyone would like to be in the China market -- everyone wants it to be like 2010 -- but things are changing.”

LONDON (Reuters) - As Britain s COVID-19 infections soared in the spring, the government reached for what it hoped could be a game changer – a smartphone app that could automate some of the work of human contact tracers.
The origin of the NHS COVID-19 App goes back to a meeting on March 7 when three Oxford scientists met experts at NHSX, the technical arm of the UK s health service. The scientists presented an analysis that concluded manual contact tracing alone couldn t control the epidemic.
""Given the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and the high proportion of transmissions from presymptomatic individuals, controlling the epidemic by manual contact tracing is infeasible,"" concluded the Oxford scientists  paper, which was published in the journal Science two months later.
The Oxford researchers believed that a smartphone app could help locate individuals who didn t know they were infected – and by alerting them quickly could reduce and even halt the epidemic if enough people used it. Within days of the meeting, NHSX began the process of awarding millions of dollars worth of no-bid contracts to develop such an app, government procurement records show.
In the weeks that followed, ministers seized on the technology as a route out of Britain s lockdown that began on March 23. At a Downing Street coronavirus briefing on April 12, health secretary Matt Hancock announced that testing had begun on what he called the government s ""next step – a new NHS app for contact tracing.""
He explained that people could use the app to report feeling unwell and it would anonymously alert other app users who recently had been in close contact with them. On April 28, he said he expected the app to be ready by mid-May.
Privately, some researchers who had proposed the app were dismayed that the government had stopped widespread testing on March 12, a decision they believed undermined the app s effectiveness and public health in general. ""We were very clear from the start that this thing needed to work with testing,"" David Bonsall, a clinical scientist at Oxford who attended the March 7 meeting, told Reuters.
By early May, transport secretary Grant Shapps was heralding a test of the app on England s Isle of Wight. ""Later in the month, that app will be rolled out and deployed, assuming the tests are successful, of course, to the population at large,"" he said. ""This is a fantastic way to ensure that we are able to really keep a lid on this going forward.""
Pat Gelsinger, chief executive of VMware  Inc, a Silicon Valley tech firm hired to develop the app, told a Fox Business television interviewer on May 8, ""I tell you, we think this is the best one in the world and we re really thrilled to be working with the NHS in the UK to help bring it about.""
But by the end of May, government officials were downplaying the app. In an interview with Sky News, Hancock called the app ""helpful"" but said traditional contact tracing needed to be rolled out first. Quoting another official, he said, ""It puts the cherry on the cake but isn t the cake.""
Behind the scenes, NHSX testers were discovering serious technical problems.
The agency had opted to develop an app that collected and stored data on central servers that could be used by health authorities and epidemiologists to study the disease. It relied on a technology called Bluetooth to determine who recently had been near someone displaying symptoms and for how long.
NHSX testers were finding that while the app could detect three-quarters of nearby smartphones using Google  s Android operating system, it sometimes could only identify four percent of Apple  iPhones, according to government officials. The problem was that, on Apple devices, the app often couldn t utilize Bluetooth because of a design choice by Apple to preserve user privacy and prolong battery life.
The issue was no secret. Apple and Google had jointly announced in April that they would release a toolkit to better enable Bluetooth on contact-tracing apps. But to protect user privacy, it would only work on apps that stored data on phones, not central servers. The NHSX app didn t work that way.
The government insisted it had developed a successful work-around to overcome the Apple issue. But not everyone was convinced. The advocacy group Privacy International, which had tested the app in early May, ""found it wasn t working properly on iPhones,"" Gus Hosein, the group s executive director, told Reuters. But because of the government s assurances, he said, ""We just assumed we were doing something wrong.""
Other countries, including Germany, decided they would change their apps to work with the Apple-Google toolkit. That raised another problem with the UK app — it likely wouldn t be compatible with many other contact-tracing apps so British travellers wouldn t be notified if they were exposed to the virus.
On June 18, weeks after the UK app was supposed to be rolled out, government officials announced a dramatic U-turn — they would abandon the app being tested on the Isle of Wight and try to create one that worked with the Apple-Google technology. Work had already begun on it and they had learned lessons from the test, they said.
NHSX referred questions about the app to the health department, which said, ""Developing effective contact-tracing technology is a challenge facing countries around the world and there is currently no solution that is accurate enough on estimating distance, identifying other users and calculating duration which are all required for contact tracing.""

A spokesman for VMware said it ""is proud of the work we have done and continue to do to rapidly develop an application to support the UK s contact tracing and testing efforts.""
A government official expressed confidence the app would be ready by the autumn or winter — although initially, the official said, it might not contain contact tracing at all, but offer other services that are yet to be determined. "

The media company said publishers should be fairly compensated for their content and Apple News did not align with its strategy of building direct relationships with paying readers.
NYT, which has more than four million subscribers for its news product, added a record 468,000 paid subscribers in the last reported quarter.

The company has focused on online for several years to stem losses from its print subscription platform and to lower its dependence on ad revenue."

Investing.com - The Dow made a strong start to the week, powered by surge in Boeing  as the aircraft maker s 737 MAX took its first steps toward recertification after Federal Aviation Administration got testing of the much-maligned jets underway.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.32%, or 579 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.46%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.20%.
The Federal Aviation Administration initiated its recertification flight for Boeing s 737 MAX jets, marking a key step toward getting the planes, which have been grounded since March last year, back in operation, sending the aircraft maker s shares soaring 12%.
The test, which will take place over three days, would also examine whether the flaws in the 737 MAX s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) - that many blame for the two crashes that killed 346 people – have been remedied.
The move higher in Boeing lifted sentiment across airlines as American Airlines , United Airlines  and Delta Air Lines  rose sharply. 
Also adding to positive sentiment on airlines, Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on Southwest Airlines Company  to buy from sell and raised its price target on the stock to $47 from $35 per share, citing the carrier s domestic focus and better-than-expected cash management in the airline industry. 
Yet,  demand remains the overarching concern for airlines at a time when Covid-19 cases continued to mount.
Coronavirus cases worldwide passed 10 million over the weekend, driven by an ongoing spread of the virus in the U.S., where the death toll has topped 125,000 with as many as 2.6 million confirmed infections.
“Although many countries have made some progress, globally, the pandemic is actually speeding up,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual news conference.
The sharp jump in cases has added a sense of urgency to the development of treatments and vaccines.
Gilead Sciences , up 1%, said its coronavirus treatment, Remdesivir, would cost hospitals $3,120 for patients with private health insurance.
U.S. health secretary Alex Azar has warned that ""the window is closing"" on the country’s chance to contain the coronavirus.
Energy, meanwhile, also lent support to the broader market, underpinned by rising oil prices as better-than-expected industrial data from China, the largest oil consumer, suggested its economic recovery remained on track.
In technology, Facebook  cut losses to end nearly 2% higher despite Starbucks , Coca-Cola , and Microsoft , joining the growing list of companies temporarily pausing social media advertising.   
Apple  ended 2% higher, with news that The New York Times has ended its partnership with Apple News drawing a muted reaction. 
Elsewhere,  Beyond Meat  fell 9% after  Barclays   downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight, as an uncertain outlook for restaurant industry and a recovering meat supply chain are expected to weigh on growth."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - IPhone maker Apple , the target of EU antitrust investigations into key segments of its business, on Tuesday rejected accusations of market dominance, saying it competes with Google , Samsung (KS:005930) and other rivals. 
Earlier this month, the European Commission opened investigations into Apple s App Store and mobile payment system Apple Pay, concerned about its role as a gatekeeper to its lucrative platform.
""We compete with a wide variety of companies, Google, Samsung, Huawei, Vivo, LG, Lenovo and many more,"" Daniel Matray, head of Apple s App Store and Apple Media Services, told a Forum Europe online event.
""In fact, Apple does not have a dominant position in any market, and we face strong competition in every category, in tablets, wearables, desktop and notebook computers, maps, music, payments, messaging, and more,"" he said.
Matray defended Apple s App Store, saying the same rules apply to all developers, large and small, with 85% of apps not required to pay a 30% fee to the company which is only valid for those which use its in-app payment service.
The EU is investigating whether this requirement and rules preventing developers from informing users of cheaper products elsewhere are anti-competitive. 
It is also probing Apple s terms and conditions on how its mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants  apps and websites, and also the company s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system.
The EU investigations were prompted by a complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify  and an e-book rival.
Matray said the App Store has boosted competition, rather than harmed rivals.

""In the nearly 12 years since the App Store debuted, the best measure of its success is the dynamism it has unleashed and the state of the app economy today,"" he said. "

NEW DELHI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - An Indian ban on dozens of Chinese apps following a border clash between the two nations has possibly derailed a $1 billion India expansion plan of China s ByteDance, while also sparking an uproar from users of its popular TikTok video app.
TikTok was blocked on Google  and Apple  app stores in India after New Delhi said on Monday night it was among the 59 apps which it believed posed a ""threat to sovereignty and integrity"". Late on Tuesday, TikTok s already downloaded versions on phones in India stopped showing any videos. [nL4N2E63K0]
The government order didn t name China, or cite the border clashes. App analytics firm Sensor Tower said all the 59 apps named were of Chinese origin, including Tencent s WeChat and  Alibaba   s UC Browser.
""If this is not rolled back, these companies would be constrained to cut back their operations in India, potentially resulting in a loss of employment,"" said a lawyer who advises a Chinese company whose app has been banned in India. 
China s foreign ministry said it was ""strongly concerned"" about India s decision. The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said it suspected the move violated WTO rules.
The biggest casualty appears to be ByteDance, which has since last year hired several senior executives and laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. India is TikTok s top growth market and accounts for 30% of its 2 billion downloads worldwide.
TikTok said in a statement the Indian government had invited the company to respond to the ban and submit clarifications, adding that it complies with all data security and privacy requirements. It did not comment on the fate of its expansion plan.
""Our managers say there is no need to panic and it s business as usual. But we all are concerned about losing jobs,"" one ByteDance content reviewer in the southern city of Hyderabad told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
 HOW WILL I LIVE NOW? 
Following the ban order, many TikTok users posted videos expressing their displeasure before the app stopped showing content on Tuesday. 
One user @omkarsharma988 posted a video in which he throws utensils to the ground, hits a chair and weeps, with a Hindi song playing ""You ve left me, how will I live now?"" The video had been liked 218,000 times, as the app still functions on phones on which it is already downloaded.
When TikTok was banned briefly last year after a state court said the app encouraged pornography, the company told the Supreme Court the ban cost it roughly $15 million a month.
Several Indian lawyers said chances of a success through a legal challenge this time were slim given the government had invoked national security concerns, meaning the Chinese companies can only hope to lobby India to reverse the decision.
""From a legal perspective, it (the ban) is sound because grounds like national security are difficult to challenge,"" said Santosh Pai of Link Legal, which advises Chinese companies.
The ban has also disappointed Tencent, which has apps on the market and is also a major investor in Indian startups, two sources aware of the company s concerns told Reuters. New Delhi in April mandated screening of incoming investments from countries like China, hitting the likes of Tencent.
While its WeChat messaging app is not that popular in India, the company fears the government could impose a ban later on the mobile version of its blockbuster game PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds, said one of the sources. Tencent declined to comment.
Two games of China-based firms, ""Mobile Legends"" and ""Clash of Kings"", were among those banned on Monday.
Sensor Tower said the 59 banned apps had recorded roughly 4.9 billion downloads in India since January 2014.

On June 15, Indian and Chinese troops brawled for several hours on their disputed Himalayan border, killing 20 Indian soldiers and wounding at least 76, India said. China has not disclosed how many casualties its troops suffered."

Saint John, who has been vocal about inequality in corporate America, joins from entertainment and talent agency Endeavor where she was the head of marketing since 2018. She also previously worked at Apple Inc  and Uber Technologies  Inc.
The appointment comes at a time as U.S. companies are looking to diversify their workplace.
The death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, at the hands of police has triggered protests in the United States against racism and police brutality, while also reigniting the debate of diversity in America s corporate boardrooms.

Netflix, earlier in the day, said it will allocate 2%, or about $100 million, of its cash holdings to financial institutions and organizations that directly support African-American communities in the United States."
