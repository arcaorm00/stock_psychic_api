(Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Tesla  Inc s effort to dismiss claims by two former workers that the California electric car factory where they worked was a hotbed of racial hostility, clearing the way for a possible trial.
In a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco found open questions over whether Owen Diaz and his son Demetric Di-az faced ""severe and pervasive racial harassment"" in 2015 and 2016 at Tesla s factory in suburban Fremont, which employs more than 10,000 people.
The plaintiffs, who are black, said they were subjected to repeated racial epithets dozens of times, as well as racist cartoons, and that supervisors engaged in or did little to stop the racism.
Orrick said Diaz could pursue claims that Tesla allowed and did not take reasonable steps to stop racial harassment.
He said punitive damages might be available if Tesla must have known about the harassment and ""ratified"" it, even if only lower level workers were directly involved.
""The n-word is perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English, a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry,"" Orrick wrote. ""This case will proceed to trial.""
A trial is scheduled for May 11, 2020.
Tesla and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Palo Alto, California-based company has faced multiple racial harassment lawsuits, but is not the only automaker to face such claims in recent years.
In 2017, Ford Motor  Co agreed to pay up to $10.1 million to settle a federal probe into alleged harassment at two Chicago plants.
Tesla has in court papers said it ""did not hesitate"" to address racial abuse at the Fremont factory, and there was no proof of ""oppression, malice, or fraud.""
Orrick also said Diaz could pursue claims against a staffing agency that assigned him to the factory, and a liaison between Tesla and that agency.
Lawrence Organ, the plaintiffs  lawyer, said his clients are seeking damages ""in the millions"" of dollars.
""Tesla is not sending a message that this kind of conduct in the workplace is not permitted,"" he said in an interview.
Owen Diaz said he worked at Tesla for 11 months as an elevator operator, while Demetric Di-az spent two months as a production associate.
Allegations included a claim that Diaz s supervisor admitted to drawing a cartoon of ""a black face person with a bone in his hair"" and captioned ""booo,"" supposedly short for ""jigaboo.""
""You people can t take a joke,"" Diaz said the supervisor told him.

The case is Di-az et al v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-06748."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fatal Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla  Inc vehicle in Southern  California will be investigated by the U.S. government s auto safety regulator, the agency said on Tuesday.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said earlier this month it had opened an investigation into a 12th Tesla crash that may be tied to the vehicle’s advanced Autopilot driver assistance system after a Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a parked police car in Connecticut.
NHTSA did not say if autopilot was suspected in Sunday s crash in Gardena in Los Angeles county.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Los Angeles television station KTLA reported the driver exited the 91 Freeway in Gardena, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
The two people inside the Tesla were hospitalized but did not have life-threatening injuries, KTLA reported, citing Los Angeles police.
Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles that were involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. The National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Autopilot s lack of safeguards and said in September in its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California Tesla crash that the system’s design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.""
Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system. Last month, U.S. Senator Ed Markey said Tesla should disable Autopilot until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep.

NHTSA has previously confirmed special crash investigations in a number of Tesla crashes but until earlier this month had not disclosed the total number of crashes under review. NHTSA previously investigated another Tesla crash that it initially suspected of being tied to Autopilot but ruled it out."

The Shanghai plant is part of the Silicon Valley automaker s plans to bolster its presence in the world s biggest auto market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. 
Fifteen Tesla employees who had purchased the car were the first to take delivery on Monday after the first China-made vehicles rolled off the plant s production line in October.
The deliveries come a year after construction of Tesla s only plant outside the United States began. Production started in October with a target of 250,000 vehicles per year once the Model Y is added to the line up.
""As Model 3s roll off Tesla s Chinese manufacturing facility with local subsidies intact, we believe the U.S.-based focus will need to shift globally for the company,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to clients.
China will be an important market for the company in 2020, said Dorsheimer, who raised his price target on Tesla to $515, the second-highest on Wall Street. 
The Model 3 is priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies. Tesla said previously that it wanted to start deliveries before the Chinese new year beginning Jan. 25.
Tesla s China general manager, Wang Hao, said the company plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January. 
Tesla executives also told reporters the plant had achieved a production target of 1,000 units per week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been ""very good"".
Hao had said the company will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China in 2020.
Shares of Tesla, which is expected to report its fourth-quarter delivery numbers in the next few days, rose 1.1% to $422.88 in premarket trading.

(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. s  price target was raised by more than $100 at Canaccord Genuity, which wrote that the trend toward electric vehicles “will only accelerate in 2020.”
The target was raised to $515 from $375, one of the highest on Wall Street and near the Street-high view of $530. The average price target is about $302, according to Bloomberg data.
The move comes ahead of Tesla reporting fourth-quarter delivery numbers next week. Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer, who reiterated a buy rating on the stock, expects the data will validate the trend of higher electric-vehicle adoption.
“While bears have feared demand issues as a function of tax credit expiration for Tesla, we suspect a solid Q4 combined with the robust Q3 should put these fears to rest,” he wrote to clients. He expects Tesla will report nearly 369,000 units delivered over 2019, above the company’s own guidance of 360,000.
Shares of Tesla rose 1.7% in pre-market trading. The stock gained about 26% over the course of 2019 and recently surged to record levels.
Canaccord was not the only firm to start the new year by expressing optimism about Tesla’s 2020 delivery prospects. JMP Securities wrote that “unit consensus expectations for this year are oddly low.” Analyst Joseph Osha speculated that the consensus didn’t reflect a contribution from Tesla’s Shanghai facility."

The reduction, partly thanks to 24,750 yuan of subsidies, from an earlier 355,800 yuan is among a slew of adjustments Tesla has made to its sales policy in China, including tweaking prices for car accessories and home charging facilities.
Tesla has said it plans to start delivering cars, made at its $2 billion factory in Shanghai, to the public on Jan. 7. 
Fifteen Tesla employees who had purchased the car were the first to take delivery on Monday after the first China-made vehicles rolled off the plant s production line in October. 
The deliveries come a year after construction of Tesla s only plant outside the United States began. 
Earlier this week, Tesla said that 30% of its China supply chain was localized, which means some car parts are shipped in to build its cars. The automaker wants to completely localize its China supply chain by end-2020, it said at the time. 
Tesla plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January and will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China in 2020, its executives have said.
The plant has achieved a production target of 1,000 units per week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been ""very good"", according to the executives.

OSLO (Reuters) - New electric car sales in Norway rose by a third last year amid soaring demand for Tesla Inc s  vehicles, but the pioneering U.S. company will face a more competitive market in 2020 as rivals prepare to launch new electric models.
Fully electric cars made up 42.4% of sales in the Nordic country last year, a global record, rising from a 31.2% market share in 2018 and just 5.5% in 2013, the Norwegian Road Federation said on Friday.
Norway, which is Europe s biggest oil and gas producer, is seeking to become the first country to end the sale of fossil-fueled cars by 2025. The country has exempted battery-powered vehicles from the taxes imposed on petrol and diesel engines and after just a few years the streets of Oslo have become quieter and have less air pollution.
Most of Norway s top-10 cars in 2019 were electric, including Volkswagen s Golf (DE:VOWG_p), Nissan s (T:7201) Leaf, Audi s  e-tron, BMW s  i3, Jaguar s I-PACE and several of Hyundai s (KS:005380) models.
New car sales in the country last year were 142,381, of which 60,316 were fully electric. This year, as many as six in 10 of all new cars sold in the country could be fully electric, said Volkswagen (VW) distributor Harald A. Moeller AS, which is preparing to launch several models in 2020.
Other importers predicted the market share in 2020 would be in a range of 50-60% of all sales.
""The electrification of the car market is accelerating ... we forecast electric vehicles to hold a 100% market share in 2025,"" Volkswagen said of the outlook for Norway.
The country s best-selling car in 2019 was Tesla s mid-sized Model 3 sedan, which retails from 384,900 Norwegian crowns ($43,721.74), racking up an 11% market share in the California-based firm s first attempt at cracking the mass market.
Rising global awareness of climate change has encouraged a shift in regulation, technology and consumer preferences, disrupting the auto industry and boosting Tesla s share price to make it one of the world s most highly valued car brands.
This year, the company will start producing a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, the Model Y, but faces competition from a plethora of rivals, including by Daimler AG s Mercedes-Benz, VW s Audi and  Ford Motor Co  .
""There will be between 20 and 30 new electric models on the market in 2020, many of them launching early in the year,"" the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association said in a statement.
Ford late last year unveiled the Mustang Mach-E SUV, which it hopes will help turn around its flagging fortunes.
""It will compete with Tesla s models 3 and Y. I also think Audi e-tron is a big competitor. The customers have waited for this car for over two years,"" said Kjetil Hagestande, chief executive of Ford importer RoehneSelmer.
""This amazing car with four-wheel drive and long range fits the Norway market perfectly,"" Hagestande told Reuters on the sidelines of the Mach-E launch in November.
Also aiming for a slice of Norway s market is China s Geely [GEELY.UL] group, whose Polestar and Volvo brands will begin producing fully electric cars this year.
In October, Polestar opened its first European showroom in Oslo s most upmarket shopping district, rubbing shoulders with fashion designers rather than with rival auto makers.
""I m here to consider a new car because my wife already has her second electric car, a Hyundai,"" said Espen Cook, a retired IT worker, on a recent visit to the Polestar venue.
""Two months ago I sold my hybrid Lexus so I would like to go full electric,"" the 70-year-old told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  beat Wall Street estimates for annual vehicle deliveries and met the low-end of its own target, sending shares to a record high in a vindication for Chief Executive Elon Musk after a few turbulent years. 
Boosted by demand for its mass-produced Model 3 sedans as overseas sales pick up, Tesla on Friday said it delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 92,550 Model 3s and 19,450 Model S/X SUVs, which was above expectations of 104,960 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The Silicon Valley carmaker delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles during all of 2019, just meeting the low end of its target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
Tesla shares were up as much as 5.5% at $454, touching a record high. 
The stock has had a strong run in recent months after posting a rare profit in the latest quarter and news of China ramp up. With a market valuation of more than $80 billion, Tesla is far outstripping those of traditional carmakers General Motors Co  and  Ford Motor Co  .
(Graphic: Tesla 2019 share movement click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/15/3945/3945/tesla.png) 
The delivery results defy skeptics of Musk, whose mercurial behavior over the last two years came under close scrutiny from federal regulators and shareholders of Tesla.
Musk, who has more than 30 million Twitter followers, has a history of firing off tweets that resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a defamation trial against him.
The Tesla CEO settled the SEC complaint for $20 million in 2018 and a Los Angeles jury cleared Musk in the defamation case in December. 
""Elon has Tesla executing right on track,"" said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin. 
CHINA RAMP-UP
Tesla also provided an update on its Shanghai factory, which has started churning out Model 3 cars. It said the plant demonstrated a production run-rate capability of more than 3,000 units per week. 
The run-rate shows that the factory appears to be ramping faster than expected, Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said. ""Shanghai deliveries should be the next catalyst to drive volume growth.""
The $2-billion factory, Tesla s first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world s biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars.
A company representative on Thursday said that Tesla will deliver its first China-made Model 3 sedans to the public on Jan. 7. 
The Model 3 is Tesla s most affordable car, with lower-range versions available starting at $35,000.
Analysts in the past have questioned how rapidly Tesla s vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets. Some analysts consider those subsidies the biggest driver for Tesla purchases.
Traditional automakers largely relying on fuel-powered vehicles on Friday reported a decline in fourth-quarter U.S. sales and saw their shares tumble as a widening conflict with Iran pushed oil prices more than $2 a barrel on Friday.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV   on Friday said it saw a 2% fall in U.S. auto sales, while GM reported its fourth-quarter U.S. deliveries were down more than 6%.
""The recently escalating geopolitical uncertainties driving oil prices higher are likely to create a tailwind for TSLA shares,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer said.

Traders shorting Tesla have lost about $900 million in just the first two trading days of 2020, adding to mark-to-market losses of $2.9 billion last year, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.
Tesla said on Friday it delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating expectations of 104,960 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles during all of 2019, just meeting the low end of its target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.
That report pushed Tesla s stock up 3.7% to $446.21, bringing its gain in the past three months to about 90% in a rally fueled by a surprise third quarter profit and signs of progress ramping up production at the company s new factory in China.
Tesla on Friday said it demonstrated a production run-rate capability of more than 3,000 units per week at the Shanghai factory.
Overall short interest in Tesla is about $11.9 billion, and while some traders have cut their losses in recent months, Friday s rally did not appear to be forcing significantly more traders to capitulate, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners.
About 21% of Tesla s shares are currently sold short, down from about 28% in October, according to S3 Partners.
Chief Executive Elon Musk s progress has defied skeptics expecting Tesla to be overtaken by more established car companies, including General Motors Co ,  Ford Motor Co   and BMW .
""We think questions remain about first half 2020 results and gross margin sustainability; we point out that Tesla is already lowering prices in China and faces a flood of (electric vehicle) competition in the U.S., with at least 25 new models debuting this year,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in a client note on Friday. Nelson upped his price target for Tesla by $80 to $400 and maintained his ""hold"" opinion.

(Reuters) - U.S. automakers on Friday reported another year of stable sales of pick-up trucks, as discounts during the crucial holiday season and lower interest rates on vehicle loans attracted buyers while demand for passenger cars retreated further.
Passenger cars have fallen out of favor with buyers amid lower oil prices and automakers have focused on selling larger sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pick-ups that are also more profitable.
December is among the hottest months for auto sales in the United States as buyers take advantage of significant discounts provided by the car manufacturers to clear inventory.

(Reuters) - German automotive supplier Robert Bosch said Thursday it has developed a sensor that lets cars ""see"" a three-dimensional view of the road, aiming to lower the cost of technology that could speed the development of self-driving vehicles.
Privately-held Bosch said the internally-developed lidar sensor, which it will show at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, will cover both long and close ranges on highways and in the city and will work in conjunction with the company s camera and radar technologies.
Lidar technology, which uses light-based sensors to generate a three-dimensional view of the road, remains a relatively young technology that is still in flux. In its current form, it is too expensive for mass market use, but if a cheaper lidar sensor were widely adopted, it could provide more depth data that would allow self-driving cars to detect the distance to other road users like pedestrians.
While numerous start-ups are working on lidar, the involvement of large and trusted suppliers like Bosch could help speed adoption of the technology.
""Bosch is making automated driving a viable possibility in the first place,"" Bosch management board member Harald Kroeger said in a statement.
Initially using bulky spinning devices placed on the roof of cars, lidar developers have transitioned to more compact solid-state devices that can be mounted on other parts of a car, such as near the headlights. These now sell for less than $10,000 in limited quantities, but analysts say they must sell for as little as $200 in mass production to become commercially viable.
Bosch did not provide a timeline, pricing or technology details for its lidar, but a spokesman said the company is working on making the sensors ""production ready"" and the focus will be on ""affordable mass market"" technology.
The spokesman declined to say whether Bosch already had auto customers for the sensor.
The development of self-driving cars has hit a speed bump as costs and regulatory concerns cause automakers and tech companies to rethink their plans.
Lidar is currently used by companies including General Motors Co ,  Ford Motor Co   and Alphabet Inc s  Waymo. Apple Inc  also is evaluating the technology.
Others are less enthusiastic about adopting lidar, citing a high cost and limited capabilities - including Elon Musk s Tesla Inc  and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201).
Last April, Musk called lidar ""a fool s errand"" that was too costly and said anyone relying on the technology was ""doomed."" Tesla vehicles rely on cameras and radars as their vision system for self-driving.
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in lidar start-ups over the last few years.
Other major suppliers developing the technology include  Valeo  , Aptiv , and Continental . Last July, Valeo said it had won 500 million euros ($560 million)worth of orders for its lidar sensor products.

Now comes the challenging part.
The electric Model 3 sedans rolling off the assembly line at Tesla’s Shanghai plant — its first outside the U.S. — face a market where total vehicle sales are expected to fall for a third straight year. After capturing about 5% of China’s car sales, electric vehicles have been losing steam as the economy cooled and the government scaled back subsidies for buyers.
That could spell trouble for a launch that investors are watching closely for evidence that Tesla has what it takes to go global. A slow start for sales of its made-in-China cars would put more pressure on the unprofitable manufacturer’s finances, giving Musk little room for missteps to support a stock that’s hovering at an all-time high.
“Tesla is rushing to start deliveries before other global brands bring in more EVs,” said Zhang Yan, an analyst at research firm LMC Automotive in Shanghai. “It’s an attempt to conquer the market.”
EV sales plunged 42% in China in November as the government handouts that lowered sticker prices receded significantly. That means Musk and his team are looking at a market that’s very different from mid-2018, when the decision to build a Shanghai plant was announced. Back then, the industry’s sales were growing at a roughly 100% clip.
The tough market could mean that Tesla sells just 21,000 China-built Model 3s this year, according to LMC Automotive. That would qualify as a sluggish start given the Shanghai facility already builds more than 1,000 cars a week and plans to double production during the next year.
The forecast takes into account Tesla’s history of production delays, potential supply-chain constraints and the complexity of manufacturing high-quality cars at scale, LMC Automotive said.
Yet others are more optimistic. Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight, said Tesla could sell about 100,000 Model 3 cars. Wang Lei, a Shanghai-based analyst for China International Capital Corp., said Tesla could sell a combined 120,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
Given Tesla’s volatile share price, investors will be hyperfocused on the Shanghai ramp-up.
Success in boosting China sales could propel Tesla to as high as $500 a share, a  Morgan Stanley   analyst, Adam Jonas, said in a December note to clients. Tesla climbed to a record $443.01 on Friday after rising 26% last year. Analysts expect the stock to fetch $311.41 in 12 months, based on 31 target prices compiled by Bloomberg.
So far, the China project has gone smoothly. Musk’s visits helped the company get preferential bank loans and swift approvals for construction and manufacturing. And while the subsidies are being phased out, the locally built Model 3 still qualified for a sizable handout of as much as about $3,550 per car.
But success requires winning over the consumer. A majority of China’s EV purchases — about 70%, according to Sanford C. Bernstein — so far have been to the government and “policy-direct” customers, including taxis, mobility services and other government-affiliated fleet operators. Such buyers typically forgo premium cars like Teslas in favor of cheaper, local models.
“It’s a distorted need,” said Robin Zhu, an analyst with Bernstein. “And the market won’t change much in the next two-to-three years.”
Cars that cost less than 100,000 yuan ($14,300) make up more than half of EV sales in China, according to Bernstein. Tesla last week cut the starting price of the Model 3 to 323,800 yuan from 355,800 yuan -- a 9% reduction. Subsidies lower the starting price to 299,050 yuan.
“To paraphrase Elon Musk, demand may be insanely high, but people literally cannot afford to buy them,” Zhu said.
To be sure, there is a segment of China’s massive population that can afford Teslas. But the Palo Alto, California-based company won’t be the sole global EV brand targeting those buyers.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s Audi plans to start selling nine new-energy-vehicle models in China during the next two years, with more than half of them being pure battery-electric. The first electric model, the E-Tron, debuted in November at a starting price of about 693,000 yuan.
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz EQC electric model became available in October and starts at 580,000 yuan. BMW AG plans to start building the iX3 crossover in China next year and is working with a Chinese partner to electrify its Mini model.
There also is a slew of local upstarts targeting the premium segment. Electric SUVs from NIO Inc. and Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co., or Xpeng Motors, are priced aggressively and already have found fans.
“It will be challenging for carmakers to differentiate themselves and be competitive,” said Stephen Dyer, managing director at Alixpartners, a global consulting firm.
Tesla, a pioneer in electric cars, probably will have an edge for the next one-to-two years before competition starts catching up, said David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. Tesla’s vehicles have an industry-leading driving range to go along with the brand appeal.
Boding well for the company, registrations of Tesla vehicles in China rose 14-fold to 5,597 in November. While growing from a low base, the figure suggests healthy demand for its cars even though all the models available thus far have been the pricier imported versions of the Model 3, and the higher-end Model S sedan and Model X SUV.
Tesla also doesn’t have to worry about selling traditional internal-combustion vehicles. Its global rivals operate expensive gas-guzzler plants in China and need to make sure their new EVs aren’t cannibalizing more profitable gasoline-powered lineups.
“Other multinationals, carrying the legacy of traditional automakers, came into the market reluctantly and lately. They are jumping in the pool they never wanted to swim in,“ said Bill Russo, chief executive officer of consulting firm Automobility Ltd. in Shanghai. “Tesla is not a conflicted company. They don’t have to choose."

Tesla in November said it would build its European factory on the outskirts of Berlin, a major boost for the region after BMW  and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) in recent years chose Hungary as a location for their new plants. 
""We are seeing the traditional German manufacturers, who are opening up more to new technologies, asking whether it is possible to do something in Brandenburg,"" Steinbach told Reuters in remarks published on Tuesday.
""They re asking: What made you interesting for Tesla?"" Steinbach said. ""We are noticing a pull effect,"" Steinbach said about Tesla s decision. 
Microvast, a company specialized in fast charging and battery solutions, will build a factory in Ludwigsfelde and BASF (DE:BASFn) is mulling whether to build an electric car battery cell production facility in the region, Steinbach said. 
BASF s management board is due to decide in the next six to seven months whether to formally approve the investment, Steinbach said. 

Brandenburg s state capital Potsdam, home to a university, and the region s proximity to Berlin means companies can draw from a pool of academics. Tesla will have no problem finding talented assembly workers given that rivals Audi, VW and BMW are cutting costs, Steinbach added. "

Investing.com - Global stocks have steadied as concerns over the U.S.-Iran standoff eased, while oil and gold retreated from Monday’s highs as markets recalibrated risk premiums. Automakers are in focus after Rolls-Royce  marked a 25% jump in 2019 sales and Tesla started work on its Model Y at its new Shanghai factory. U.S. trade balance data, factory orders and figures from the services sector are up ahead. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, Jan. 7.

Calm returned to markets Tuesday, but sentiment remained fragile as investors became less anxious about the chances of an all-out conflict between the United States and Iran in the absence of any fresh developments in the standoff between the two countries.
Tehran and Washington have been trading threats since Friday, when a top Iranian military commander was killed in a U.S. airstrike. The attack stoked concerns about all-out war if Tehran retaliates.
“While the risk of conflict has increased, the reality is this is likely to be limited to proxy skirmishes,"" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. ""The risk of a ""hot"" conflict seems low as Iran is unlikely to respond in such a way that risks a significant escalation from the United States.""


U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open, with Dow futures rising 25 points, or 0.1% by 6:45 AM ET (1:45 GMT), while the S&P 500 futures contract was up a similar amount and the Nasdaq 100 futures was up 0.3%.
The gains came after U.S. equities reversed early losses on Monday as strong gains in the tech sector offset geopolitical tensions.
In Europe shares recovered snapping a two-day losing streak, boosted by gains in the tech sector.  Asian markets also rebounded overnight after sharp declines on Monday.

Oil prices fell as investors reconsidered the likelihood of disruptions to Middle East supply, with global benchmark Brent crude down 47 cents to $68.47 by 6:45 AM ET (1:45 GMT) after earlier hitting an intra-day low of $67.91.
U.S. crude futures were last at $62.86 after falling 1.5% earlier.

Prices had surged during the previous two sessions, with Brent reaching its highest since September while crude rose to the most since April.

Gold prices also eased after scaling a near seven-year peak of $1,582.59 overnight as Middle East tensions cooled and investors booked profits.


British automaker Rolls-Royce  reported surging sales on Tuesday, giving some comfort to a sector that has been hit by slowing global demand. Sales at the luxury automaker jumped 25% in 2019 to a new record high, sending shares of Rolls-Royce owner BMW  higher.

In contrast, shares in   Aston Martin    plunged after it warned its annual core profit would plummet more than 45% from last year, citing weak demand in Europe.
Meanwhile, U.S. electric car maker Tesla  said Tuesday it has started work on building Model Y electric sports utility vehicles (SUV) at its $2 billion Shanghai factory, marking a new milestone for the company s first foreign car plant.


The U.S. is to release trade data 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT), followed by figures on factory orders and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Surveys of service sectors out overnight showed an improvement in the U.S., U.K. and EU, raising expectations that the closely watched ISM index of U.S. services will also show strength.

In the Euro Zone, data showed that the annual rate of inflation rose to 1.3% in December on the back of higher food prices, moving closer to the European Central Bank’s 2% target.

A separate report showed that Euro Zone retail sales jumped by 1.0% in November and were 2% higher from a year earlier."

Investing.com – U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday, led by a fall in energy stocks amid ongoing U.S.-Iran tensions.

The S&P 500 lost 0.28%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.42%. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.03%, 
With fears fading that Iran would choose to engage in all-out war with the U.S., and risk detablizing oil supplies in the Middle East, traders reined in their bullish bets on oil.
Oil prices settled 1% lower, prompting a sea of red in energy stocks that offset small gains in technology and weighed on the broader market.
In energy, Halliburton  and   Chevron    were among the biggest losers. But Apache  surged 26% after announcing – together with its joint venture partner -  a significant oil discovery at a well located off the coast of Suriname.

Preliminary data evaluating the Maka Central-1 well ""indicates the potential for prolific oil wells"" and noted that ""the size of the stratigraphic feature ... suggests a substantial resource,"" Apache said.

Gains in tech stocks, however, softened the blow in the broader market, largely thanks to surge in chip stocks, led by a rallies in Micron  and   Western Digital   .
 

The day of red on Wall Street arrived even as data showed signs the economy remained on firm footing, with services data for December topping economists  forecasts.
In other company news, Tesla  rallied as it unveiled plans to build its Model Y vehicle in China. Shares of the electric automaker were also boosted by positive feedback from Wall Street.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Elon Musk raised an online storm by dancing on stage at the launch of Tesla s  Model Y electric sports utility vehicle program on Tuesday in its new Shanghai factory, where the company delivered its first cars built outside the United States to the public.
The $2 billion Tesla Inc factory started delivering cars in just 357 days, a record for global automakers in China. The first 10 customers from the public received their China-made Model 3 sedans on Tuesday.
Billionaire CEO Musk danced enthusiastically on stage at the event, then stripped off his jacket and flung it aside to reveal a T-shirt with a cartoon of the factory. In a tweet, he labeled the video ""NSFW"" - not safe for work.
He predicted that ""ultimately Tesla Model Y will have more demand than probably all the other cars of Tesla combined"", with his voice cracking with emotion at times while talking about the progress of the Shanghai factory. 
Musk s tweet of him dancing was viewed 2.5 million times and drew unflattering comparisons to famous Silicon Valley footage of Microsoft  chiefs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer dancing awkwardly at a 1990s Windows launch. 
""Admit it Elon, you did it for the memes,"" one user tweeted https://twitter.com/RenataKonkoly/status/1214544692949475328, along with a picture of Musk stripping off his jacket. ""I see you learned your dance moves at Dad school,"" said another. 
""Just tryin to grow my follower count on pornhub ...,"" the billionaire, who has a history of being playful with his Twitter account, retorted.
The ceremony was attended by Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong and other senior government officials.
Tesla executives, however, did not provide further details on the progress of the China-made Model Y project. A Tesla representative declined to comment further.
Tesla s shares, which have jumped about 10% since the beginning of this year, are trading close to their record high after the company beat Wall Street estimates for vehicle deliveries in its fourth quarter. 
The positive news from the China factory have also caused a rally in shares of Tesla s Chinese suppliers. Shares of Tianjin Motor Dies Co Ltd (SZ:002510) have surged about 28% so far in 2020, while  VT Industrial  Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300707) is up nearly 6%. 
Construction of Tesla s first plant outside the United States began in January 2019 and production started in October.
The factory started with a production capacity of 150,000 Model 3 sedans and Tesla aims to push that to 250,000 vehicles a year, including Model Y, in the plant s first phase.
Tesla unveiled its Model Y in March 2019 and said in October that production of the electric compact SUV at its Fremont facility was running ahead of schedule, adding at the time that it expects to launch the model by summer 2020.
It has said that margin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while production costs are roughly the same.
Tesla s China website estimates the starting price for Model Y vehicles at 444,000 yuan ($63,911.56). It will announce the retail price later, the website says. The China-made Model 3 sedans are priced at 355,800 yuan before subsidies.

Shanghai Vice Mayor Wu Qing said he hoped to see Tesla extend its cooperation with the city and for the car maker to manufacture more models at its Chinese plant."

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Two major U.S. automotive trade groups said Wednesday they will merge as the industry faces dramatic challenges, including regulatory, trade and emissions issues.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing Detroit s Big Three automakers, major German automakers and others including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), is merging with Global Automakers, a group representing primarily Japanese and Korean automakers including Honda Motor Co (T:7267), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), as well as some automotive suppliers and  Peugeot  SA . 
Reuters first reported in October the two groups had been in merger talks for months and were working to finalize a tie-up, citing senior automotive officials. The merger officially took effect last week.
The newly combined entity will be named the Alliance for Automotive Innovation all will represent automakers who produce nearly 99% of all light-duty vehicles sold in the United States. The largest U.S. seller not a member is Tesla Inc .
It will be run by Global Automakers chief executive John Bozzella.
""The industry is changing dramatically. We re going through a significant transformation in not only how we move from Point A to Point B but the technologies that go into that movement,"" Bozzella told Reuters, who is announcing the merger at the CES technology show. ""This is the time to unify.""
Global Automakers  prior trade policy effort known as ""Here for America"" will be spun off to handle trade issues that do not have wide agreement in the industry.
Washington is grappling with how to address partial and eventual fully self-driving vehicles and revise fuel efficiency standards. The Trump administration has also not ruled out imposing new tariffs on major auto producing countries.
The combined group agreed it would not advance legal actions siding with the Trump administration over California emissions.
In October, General Motors Co , Toyota,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV  and Global Automakers moved to intervene on the side of the Trump administration in its efforts to bar California from setting tailpipe emissions standards, while others including  Ford Motor Co  , Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Honda opted not to join the litigation.
That legal challenge will remain independent of the new trade group. The Trump administration in the coming months plans to finalize a significant reduction in Obama-era fuel efficiency standards. That will draw numerous legal challenges and potentially leave automakers uncertain about future requirements.
The merged group had a round of voluntary buyouts in recent weeks.

GM chief executive Mary Barra said in a statement that ""as the industry is undergoing rapid transformation it is critical that we come together with a stronger voice."""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For the first time, Tesla Inc s  stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors Co  and  Ford Motor Co  .
The Silicon Valley electric car maker s stock jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, closing at a record $492.14 per share and elevating its market capitalization to almost $89 billion, or $2 billion larger than the sum of General Motors  and Ford s respective market caps of $50 billion and $37 billion.

(GRAPHIC: U.S. automakers  market cap history - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/730/730/Historical%20Market%20Caps.jpg)
Fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter, Tesla s stock has more than doubled in the past three months.
“It’s clear that Tesla is back to being a story stock and there’s a lot of good news out there,” said David Kudla, chief investment strategist at MainStay Capital Management. “But there are still some problematic issues out there, chief among them is what will its sustained profitability look like, and when will it start to be valued like a car company and not a tech company.”
The progress made by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has defied short sellers and other traders expecting the automaker to be overtaken by long-established car companies, including GM and Ford.
Underscoring investors  confidence in Musk and his company s future growth, its market capitalization has outpaced its U.S. rivals, even as their businesses dwarf Tesla s. GM and Ford each delivered more than 2 million vehicles in the United States last year, compared with Tesla s worldwide deliveries of 367,500 vehicles.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. automakers  expected sales - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/729/729/Expected%20Sales.jpg)
While Tesla s recent progress has cheered supporters, many analysts and investors remain pessimistic about the company s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow.
The company has repeatedly missed targets in recent years and Musk s mercurial behavior has come under close scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders of Tesla.
However, most mainstream automakers are still ramping up new generations of electric vehicles designed to compete with Tesla s combination of style, technology and performance.
German automakers Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG all have promised to launch fully electric premium models. GM’s Cadillac luxury brand is gearing up to launch a series of electric SUVs and cars, while Ford’s Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, unveiled in November, will launch later this year and could compete with Tesla’s Model X or soon-to-launch Model Y SUVs. Ford, GM and other manufacturers have electric pickups in the works to take on Musk’s futuristic Cybertruck.
Rival electric vehicle models from Audi, Jaguar and Porsche have fallen short of Tesla’s driving range between charges and failed to match Tesla’s brand cachet.
More analysts rate Tesla ""sell"" than ""buy,"" which is extremely unusual for companies on Wall Street. Eleven analysts recommend buying Tesla shares, while 13 recommend selling and another nine are neutral, according to Refinitiv data."

(Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday it was launching an investigation into the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla  Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.
The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company s so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.
It is the third Tesla crash NHTSA has said it was investigating in recent weeks. Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles that were involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. Tesla did not immediately comment.
NHTSA is also probing another Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited the 91 Freeway, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
Also in December, NHTSA had said it was investigating a crash in which a Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a parked police car in Connecticut.
The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system’s ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects. There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Autopilot s lack of safeguards and said in September in its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California, Tesla crash that the system’s design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.""
Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system. In November, U.S. Senator Ed Markey said Tesla should disable Autopilot until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep."

24,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/how-big-tech-is-helping-transform-cars-into-smartphones-2055731,2020-01-09,How Big Tech is helping transform cars into smartphones By Reuters,"By Jane Lanhee Lee and Stephen Nellis
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Technology companies transformed smartphones and televisions into continuous fountains of revenue. Now, big tech wants to work with automakers to do the same thing for your car.
With the widespread rollout of autonomous vehicles still years away, the two industries have converged on the idea of cars providing services and features delivered ""over the air"" - that is, over the same wireless data networks used by smart phones. 
Those services - streaming video, vehicle performance upgrades, dashboard commerce - could answer a pressing need for automakers. They need to learn how to milk their hardware for revenue long after vehicles roll off dealers  lots. Tech companies see cars and the time people spend in them as a new frontier for growth. 
Both auto and tech companies used the big CES technology show here this week to showcase their determination to make the vision of vehicles as connected revenue machines a reality. Cloud computing giants Amazon.com Inc  and  Microsoft Corp   were in the forefront, chasing the opportunity to manage torrents of data flowing to and from connected vehicles.
“It’s absolutely huge,” General Motors Co  President Mark Reuss said in December of the opportunities to generate revenue after a vehicle is sold by providing streamed services and over-the-air upgrades facilitated by GM s new high-capacity onboard electrical system. 
The pivot comes at a time when global automakers are looking for fresh revenue sources as sales slow and as rising costs to comply with tougher emissions standards threaten profit margins. Shares of legacy automakers such as  Ford Motor Co   and GM badly lagged broader market indexes in 2019. The contrast is Tesla Inc , whose market cap on Wednesday for the first time exceeded Ford and GM s combined market values.
Tesla pioneered the model for charging for over-the-air upgrades, now asking customers to pay $6,000 to turn on the full self-driving option.
Other automakers are eager to try their hand at turning cars into upgradeable, revenue-generating gadgets.
Chinese carmaker Byton s new M-Byte sedan features a 48-inch screen as a dashboard, as well as a steering-wheel display and a digital tablet for passengers. When parked, the car can be an office, enabling video conference calls, or a roadside cinema.
BMW  showed at its CES display a concept of its future interior with reclining lounge chairs and a windshield with augmented reality built in to annotate the road ahead. BMW executive Klaus Froehlich told Reuters the automaker is seeking approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to get U.S. approval for the seats, but could not say when they would appear in production.
Tech companies and suppliers want to accelerate the transformation of vehicles into subscription bundle-ready machines by helping automakers sort out the tangle of computer chips that make most current vehicles difficult or impossible to upgrade over the air.
The current crazy quilt of vehicle processors “is not cost effective, and it s hard to get (vehicles) developed and launched so that everything works all the time,” said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of auto supplier Aptiv Plc . Aptiv s solution: A new Smart Vehicle Architecture that consolidates most computerized functions.
Harman, a unit of  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), is also pushing a similar digital platform to control the flow of data in and out of the car. A centralized system, said Chief Executive Dinesh Paliwal, would help protect the car against hackers, who would have only one way in rather than dozens.
Harman, which supplies some of the technology that automakers including Tesla use to deliver the over-the-air upgrades, plans to sell its new vehicle computing brain with cybersecurity features built in - but some car buyers will have to pay to turn it on.
 Qualcomm Inc  , which already provides the cellular modem chips that allow vehicles to connect to the internet, introduced a more comprehensive computing system that can manage in-vehicle entertainment and help the car drive itself. One element is a much easier way for automakers and their partners to deliver feature upgrades, such as unlocking a better sound system already built into the car.
 NXP Semiconductors   is working on a chip that would serve as a gateway between the car and the cloud, to help automakers cope with the massive amounts of data that sensors and digital cockpits will create.
That data has to be stored and managed, and that s where cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services come in. AWS announced at CES a partnership with BlackBerry to develop a new software platform for connected vehicles.

Investing.com – Tesla  fell Thursday after a long-time bull suggested it is time to cash in on the electric automaker s recent rally that has seen its shares more than double in just three months.

Baird analyst Ben Kallo, a known Tesla  bull, downgraded Tesla to neutral from outperform. Shares fell 2%.

""We are moving to the sidelines, admittedly battle-weary after a hard-fought several years, including (approximately) 20% outperformance over the last year... After several years at an Outperform rating, which included contentious arguments with—evidently—high-conviction bears, we recommend profit-taking,"" Kallo said.

The remarkable turnaround in shares of Tesla, which have more than doubled over 90 days, saw the electric carmaker become the highest-valued automaker in U.S. history, boasting a value of $85 billion, topping the $80.8 billion set by Ford in 1999.

But en route to notching the historic milestone, Tesla shares are now fairly valued, leaving little road ahead in the near term, Kallo added.

""While we remain constructive on (the company’s) long-term prospects, we now believe estimates are properly calibrated—particularly on the buy side—and valuation appears more balanced.""
The electric automaker s red-hot run was spurred by a surprise quarterly profit reported in October last year. Since then, reports of progress in China and record deliveries have continued the momentum.

Tesla delivered a record 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, taking the total to 367,500 deliveries, up 50% from 2018.
But some argued that the upswing in demand in the quarter was driven by consumers eager to make a purchase before subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles expire.

Tesla s move into China, however, has the potential to ramp up deliveries,   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) suggested.

Baird & Co.
The Italian-American automaker reached an agreement with Tesla last spring that could cost Fiat Chrysler an estimated 1.8 billion ($2 billion) through 2023. That breaks out to about $150 million to $200 million per quarter and will pad Tesla’s profit margins starting in the first three months of this year, according to Baird analyst Ben Kallo.
“While we acknowledge investors may want to strip out credits in evaluating operational execution, we do note the credits effectively fund Tesla’s European factory,” Kallo wrote in a report Thursday. While he cut his rating on Tesla to the equivalent of a hold, from a buy, the analyst raised his price target to $525, from $355.
Representatives for Fiat Chrysler and Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced in November that Tesla planned to build a plant outside Berlin. The facility is expected to produce Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers starting in 2021.
Fiat Chrysler is going to launch a new version of its Fiat 500 battery-powered vehicle in Europe this year, along with plug-in hybrid versions of its Jeep Compass, Renegade and Wrangler models. That, combined with the Tesla credits, should make the company compliant with Europe’s emissions rules, CEO Mike Manley told analysts in July."

In China’s stock market, a rally in small caps rarely lasts and typically marks the start of excessive risk taking. This time, it’s signaling optimism about the economy.
The outperformance of the ChiNext Index relative to benchmarks of larger companies has already held for six consecutive months, a feat not seen since 2013. It’s continued to start this year.
The advance is partly due to a global risk-on rally sparked by easing trade tensions between China and the U.S. Mainland investors are also hopeful about an economic recovery after some initial signs of stabilization and an easing bias by the central bank. The result has been steady buying of small caps, which are more sensitive to swings in market sentiment given their size.
“It’s an omen, “said Zhu Chaoping, a global market strategist with JPMorgan  Asset Management. “Investors are pricing in expectations of a mild economic recovery in the first half” of 2020, and “more broad-based gains could be on the way once we see a more favorable economic environment.”
China’s consumer inflation steadied in December after hitting the highest since 2012 the previous month, the latest encouraging economic reading and potentially giving officials room to further ease monetary policy. The People’s Bank of China on New Year’s Day announced a cut to commercial banks’ reserve-requirement ratios, freeing up 800 billion yuan ($115 billion) in funds at a time investors had been expecting support.
Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He plans to sign the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S. next week in Washington.
To be sure, there might be hints of excessive investor optimism. The ChiNext is up 35% from June’s low and on Thursday notched its highest close since October 2017. The 14-day relative-strength reading for both the ChiNext and the onshore yuan has reached overbought territory, a technical benchmark which raises the potential of a near-term pullback.
Small caps are typically a barometer of market sentiment, and extreme rallies in that part of the market previously prompted regulators to take measures to avoid a repeat of 2015’s market crash.
Big start-of-year rallies have occurred for stocks linked to genetically modified crops as well as Tesla  Inc., which has started deliveries of locally made vehicles. “Some investors don’t care if the firms will deliver good earnings, so long as they can find the next buyers,” said He Qi, a fund manager with Huatai-PineBridge Fund Management Co. “I don’t think the gains will sustain” for smaller stocks.
Ken Chen, an analyst with KGI Securities Co., disagrees, noting investors have begun moving money out of blue chips and into smaller names. Large caps have been Chinese market outperformers most of the time since 2016.
“Expectations of a recovery in the economy and corporate earnings are starting to become a reality due to an overall monetary-loosening environment and stepped-up efforts to support growth,” said Chen. “Small caps with good growth stories to tell would benefit more.”

29,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-2057318,2020-01-11,3 Things Under the Radar This Week By Investing.com,"Investing.com - Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.

1. BofA Hails Citi as ‘Pick of the Decade’
Bold calls in the world of investing can leave many with egg on their face. But Bank of America  turned heads earlier this week when it hailed rival bank   Citigroup    as its ""pick of the decade.""

Bank of America  is betting big that Citi s U.S. consumer business will start churning out the growth required to match that of its rivals in the coming year, boosting its stock valuation, which has traded at a discount for years.
Its consumer business has lagged behind rivals in terms of profitability and share of deposits. But that weakness has been much of its own doing as Citi was the one big bank not expand its deposit rates during the financial crisis.
The bank has since plotted a course to turn around its U.S. consumer business.
In August 2018, it announced a string of changes at the top within its global consumer banking division and moved to a regional model, replicating a formula that worked well in its businesses in Asia and Mexico.
In the ensuing months, further management changes followed, and the bank streamlined its businesses, overhauling its investment and stock trading operations.

The bank has also zoned in on its U.S. credit card business, which accounts for the bulk of its global consumer banking revenue, to grow deposits by promoting its checking and savings accounts to card holders.
These ""sweeping management changes"" combined with continued efficiency initiatives will drive consistent improvement in return on equity, and end the stock s longtime valuation discount, BofA said.
The bold claim is not without merit.
Citi reported higher-than-expected earnings in the third quarter, with a return on tangible common equity – a key measure of profit – of 12.2%, above the goal of 12%.
The earnings beat was led by its global consumer business as north American consumer deposits grew 5% from a year earlier, nearly 2% faster than consumer deposits at Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.

With Citi s fourth-quarter results due as soon as next week, BofA need not wait long for further signs that its pick of the decade is headed in the right direction.

2. Tesla Market Cap Tops GM, Ford (Briefly)
Tesla  did something impressive this week that may or may not have been overshadowed by CEO Elon Musk dancing up a storm at a presentation in China Tuesday (depending on your social media feeds).
The next day the company’s market cap surpassed that of the next-largest, and iconic, U.S. automakers combined.

Tesla shares rose nearly 5% on Wednesday and by the close its market cap was almost $89 billion, more than the market caps of General Motors  ($50 billion) and Ford Motor  ($37 billion) combined.

But the electric automaker lost its title by a whisker as the week ended. Tesla closed Friday with a market cap of $86.18 billion.
GM ended with its market cap at $49.51 billion and Ford at $36.68 billion, for a total of $86.19 billion.

Tesla is still ahead of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which ended Friday valued at $82.69 billion.

But to get to the top valuation, Tesla would need to more than double. Toyota Motor (T:7203) ended Friday with a market cap of $195.23 billion.
Back when Ford went public in 1956, the automaker debuted with a valuation of $3.2 billion, good enough to put it at No. 3 in the Fortune 500, behind top dog Standard Oil and No. 2, GM.

3. Low-Wage Industries Seeing Pay Gains
There was some consternation about the wages information in the December employment report issued by the Labor Department Friday.
For the headline number, average hourly earnings for the month rose 0.1%, which was below economists’ expectations for a rise of 0.3%. On an annual rate, the rise in average hourly earnings edged down to 2.9%, below forecasts for 3.1%.
That can be encouraging for equity investors looking for tame wage inflation to keep the Federal Reserve at bay for 2020 and even longer.
But for those looking at the economy a whole, stagnant wages have been a persistent weak spot in the recovery.
Digging into the December numbers, though, there is a positive.
“Those average wage growth numbers may be rough, but the decline seems to be concentrated in higher-wage industries,” Nick Bunker, economist at placement firm Indeed, tweeted. “Wage growth (is) still strongest in low-wage industries.”"
30,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/electric-car-stocks-jump-as-china-signals-lull-in-subsidy-cuts-2057717,2020-01-13,Electric Car Stocks Jump as China Signals Lull in Subsidy Cuts By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle makers including Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. jumped after the government signaled it won’t continue reducing subsidies for the industry at the same pace this year.
Miao Wei, the minister for industry and information technology, told an audience in Beijing on Saturday EV-purchase subsidies won’t be cut July 1, like they were on that date last year.
“Please rest assured. There wont be a further cut on July 1 this year,” Miao said in a speech at an industry forum. The audience, which included representatives from major automakers, was thrilled enough to applaud.
Though the minister later clarified his comments, investors and the industry interpreted his remarks as good news for EV manufacturers that were hit by subsidy reductions last year. Sales of new energy vehicles have dropped for six straight months in China since the government scaled back handouts in July.
A few hours after his speech, the minister’s amended statement was aired on China National Radio and the forum’s organizers asked reporters to refer to those comments.
“In order to stabilize market expectations, and ensure the industry’s sustained development, subsidies on new-energy vehicles will stay relatively stable this year, and they won’t be scaled back significantly,” the radio station quoted the minister as saying.
Shares of BYD and competitor BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co. surged by their daily trading limit of 10% Shenzhen and Shanghai, respectively.
The minister didn’t say whether the subsidies will be fully gone by 2021, which is what the government has stated before. Wan Gang, a vice chairman of China’s national advisory body for policy making and an EV pioneer, told the forum that regulators should refrain from making subsidy changes this year so that carmakers can prepare for next year when they will be completely phased out.
China, which began subsidizing EV purchases in 2009 to promote the industry, has been gradually reducing handouts in the past few years to encourage automakers focus on innovating and competing on their own.
Other EV companies competing in China include Tesla  Inc., which started delivering locally built electric sedans this month that also qualify for subsidies, and local sport-utility-vehicle maker NIO Inc. Both companies’ shares are traded in the U.S.

The pound led declines among Group-of-10 currencies after another Bank of England official pointed to a potential vote for a U.K. interest-rate cut this month and data showed the economy unexpectedly shrank. Germany’s benchmark bund yield headed for least negative closing level since May. The offshore yuan strengthened past 6.9 per dollar for the first time since July.
The dollar edged higher and Treasuries fell across the curve as the completion of the first trade deal nears; President Donald Trump has said the U.S. and China will sign the accord on Wednesday.

China’s on the sidelines now as a headline, and we dodged the giant bullet with Iran, no pun intended,” said Said Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management. “And so what you have is no news and everything is kind of OK.”

Tesla  rose 6.5% in midday trading to $508.80
The stock received a double boost today, from China and from the sell-side on Wall Street.

China’s government said over the weekend that it won’t reduce subsidies for electric vehicles at the same pace it did last year, helping the whole electric vehicle sector and Tesla, which just started production in Shanghai, in particular.
Minister for Industry and Information Technology Miao Wei said in Beijing Saturday that the government wouldn’t cut EV-purchase subsidies on July 1, as they were last year, Bloomberg reported.

And today, Oppenheimer boosted its price target on Tesla stock to $612 per share from $385.  
""(W)e believe the company s risk tolerance, ability to implement learnings from past errors, and larger ambition than peers are beginning to pose an existential threat to transportation companies that are unable or unwilling to innovate at a faster pace."" Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch wrote in a note.

Rusche cited advantages Tesla has over competitors, including battery technology, powertrain design and customer enthusiasm.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday, as sentiment on U.S.-China trade received a boost on reports that the White House will no longer label China a currency manipulator. That comes just days ahead of the expected conclusion of the phase one trade deal.

The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.04% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.28%, 

The White House plans to remove its designation of China as a currency manipulator, according to published reports.

The U.S. government last summer tagged China with the label of currency manipulator when tensions between Washington and Beijing threatened to boil over.

The news helped raised optimism ahead of the U.S. and China signing the first phase of their trade deal on Wednesday.

The phase one trade deal would halt any escalations in tit-for-tat tariffs and roll back some existing U.S. tariffs in Chinese goods.
The positive sentiment on trade coupled with bullish calls from Wall Street on tech heavyweights like Apple  and Microsoft  helped tech stocks continued their march higher.

Apple closed at record highs after DA Davidson hiked its price target on the tech giant amid expectations it will roll out 5G iPhones later this year.
Microsoft  ended the day more than 1% higher after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the tech giant to $180 from $155.

Tesla  surged 9%, topping $500 for the first time, underpinned by a target price hike from Oppenheimer to $612 from $358

""We see the potential for GE to deliver a beat in 4Q19 and 2020 guidance that suggests upside to current consensus at the midpoint of the range,""   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) said.

Healthcare, however, proved an exception to broader rally as news that presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had taken the lead in Iowa raised concerns about the private healthcare insurance market.

Sanders has backed proposals for a universal Medicare plan, where people could be guaranteed coverage without using private insurance.  
Cigna  and UnitedHealth Group  slipped about 3%, while   Centene    fell about 2%.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla  Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk is coming close to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package, after the electric vehicle maker s stock more than doubled in the last three months.
Shares of Tesla surged 9% to a record high on Monday. They need to rise another 6% to put Tesla s stock market value at $100 billion and then be sustained at that level for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.
Musk has already hit an operational target that is also necessary for the options to vest.
For Musk s subsequent tranches to vest under the terms of the 2018 package, the company s market cap would have to continue to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the electric car maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.
A full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives, according Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor that recommended investors reject the pay package deal at the time.
Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla s market cap and milestones for growth.
""This is the very definition of pay for performance,"" said Ian Keas, senior director at Longnecker & Associates, an executive compensation consulting firm. ""But is he the only individual that could serve in that seat as CEO and deliver that value to shareholders? That s the billion dollar question.""
Musk s potential payout compares to the $638 million received by  Snap Inc   founder Evan Spiegel in 2017 after the social network company s initial public offering. In 2018, Walt  Disney   CEO Robert Iger earned stock grants worth as much as $149.6 million, including awards related to Disney s purchase of film and television assets from Twenty-First Century Fox.

Musk has transformed Tesla from a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories. So far it has stayed ahead of more established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Last week, Tesla s stock market value hit nearly $89 billion, eclipsing the sum of General Motors  and Ford s for the first time, fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.
Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth, however. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla ""sell"" than ""buy,"" and the company s stock has been one of the most shorted on Wall Street.
Tesla was valued at about $53 billion when shareholders approved the pay package in January 2018 and faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals. It was viewed as massively ambitious because it implied the company s value could grow as much as ten-fold in 10 years.
Last year, Musk hit two operational milestones, pulling in revenue above $20 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $1.5 billion over four straight quarters. Tesla s ""adjusted"" EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation, which in the first nine months of 2019 reached $617 million.
Musk currently owns about 34 million Tesla shares, equivalent to 19% of the company. His compensation package would let him buy another 20.3 million shares if all of his options vest."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will meet on Feb. 25 to determine the probable cause of the 2018 fatal crash of a Tesla Inc  vehicle in Mountain View, California, the agency said.
The board will hold a hearing on the 2017 Tesla Model X crash that killed the its driver, 38-year-old Apple  engineer Walter Huang, who was using the vehicle s advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot.
The NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are investigating a number of crashes in which Autopilot is believed to have been in use.
The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system s ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects. There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot compel action, while NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a vehicle poses an unreasonable safety risk.
Last week, NHTSA said it was launching an investigation into the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla  Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana. 
That crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects Autopilot or another advanced driver assistance system was in use. It is the third Tesla crash NHTSA has said it was investigating in recent weeks.
Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, including the 2018 Mountain View crash. Tesla did not immediately comment.
NHTSA is also probing another Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited a freeway, ran a red light, and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
The NTSB has criticized Autopilot s lack of safeguards. It said in September that its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California, Tesla crash found the system s design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.""
Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system.

The massive drop comes as tax credit for Tesla buyers ended in 2019. It had fallen to $3,750 at the start of the year and had halved to $1,875 in July.
An existing $7,500 U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), which allows taxpayers to deduct a part of the cost of buying an electric car, phases out over 15 months once an automaker hits 200,000 cumulative EV sales, which Tesla hit in July 2018.
The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether market for the electric-car maker, plummeted 46.5% to 13,584 in the quarter ended December 2019, from 25,402 in the same period a year earlier.
Model 3 registrations, which accounted for about three-fourth of the total, halved to 10,694.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
""One can assume that Tesla has hit peak performance in the U.S. because they have not exceeded their 2018 results for five months now,"" said Shane Marcum, vice-president of Cross-Sell."

(Reuters) - Korea s Hyundai Group is backing a UK electric vehicle startup that plans to begin selling battery-powered delivery vans in 2021, the companies said on Thursday.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and sister firm Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) are making the investment of 100 million euros ($110 million) in Arrival Ltd.
Founded in 2015 and based in London, Arrival has developed a boxy, futuristic-looking shuttle bus aimed at the commercial delivery market. The company said its van will have a range between charges of 300 miles.
In a statement, Arrival said it will work with Hyundai and Kia to develop a variety of electric vehicles, initially for the commercial market. Those vehicles will be built on Arrival s modular vehicle platform or ""skateboard"" that bundles motor, batteries and chassis components, similar to the skateboard developed by U.S. startup Rivian.
Rivian is backed by  Ford Motor Co   and Amazon , and has a contract to build 100,000 electric delivery vans for the e-commerce giant, starting in 2021.
Hyundai and Kia last year invested $89 million in Rimac Automobili, a nine-year-old Croatian company aspiring to build electric supercars that is also backed by Porsche AG (KS:000270).
Arrival said its vehicles will be equipped with advanced driver assist features and can be upgraded with self-driving systems.
The vehicles are designed to sell for the same price as similar models powered by internal combustion engines and to be built in small ""microfactories."" That strategy is the opposite of U.S. electric vehicle rival Tesla  which uses massive ""gigafactories.""
Last fall, Arrival, which until now has operated largely in stealth mode, hired General Motors  veteran Michael Ableson to head its new North American operations.
With a small factory in Banbury, England, Arrival said it now has 800 employees in five countries, including Germany, Russia and Israel.
Arrival previously said it would use BlackBerry s  QNX operating system to connect safety features in its electric vehicles."

Wednesday s notice sought to recruit designers and other staff to help fulfill the goal, and called for applications by Feb. 1, but did not identify the center s location. 
""In order to achieve a shift of  Made in China  to  Designed in China , Tesla s CEO Elon Musk has proposed a very cool thing - set up a design and research center in China,"" it read.
It was not immediately clear when the center might begin operations, however. 
Tesla s first factory outside the United States is in the eastern city of Shanghai, and it started delivering China-made Model 3 vehicles this month.
Last week, Musk launched a Model Y electric sports utility vehicle program at the $2 billion factory, with an on-stage dance that raised an online storm. 
That was also the week that Tesla s stock market value hit nearly $89 billion, eclipsing the sum of General Motors  and Ford s values for the first time.

The stock move was fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at the new China factory and better-than-expected fourth quarter deliveries."

By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Tesla  shares fell in midday trading Thursday, which shouldn’t be a big surprise to anyone who’s been watching the stock lately.
The stock has nearly doubled in the last six months. Rallies do run out of steam and even the most bullish of bulls take some profits on a hot stock.
Shares were down about 3.4% due to a couple of reasons.

First, a report showed that the electric automaker’s sales in California nearly halved in the final quarter of 2019 as a ramp-up in tax credits for buyers of Tesla cars ended.
The second, a downgrade from   Morgan Stanley    today, is more interesting.
 Morgan Stanley   simultaneously downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight and raised its price target to $360 per share from $250.
This kind of dichotomy happens when an analyst is caught flat-footed by a rally but still doesn’t like the stock, so the price target base is raised.

Morgan Stanley is still saying sell – its price target implies a drop of around 30% from where shares sit now around $500 – but don’t expect as much of a plunge as previously thought.

Here’s why Morgan analyst Adam Jonas said he is still pessimistic, according to Briefing.com.

""We downgrade Tesla shares to Underweight from Equal-weight based on (1) valuation, (2) unfavorable risk-reward, and (3) risks to the long-term Chinese business that may not be fully appreciated by the market.""

But Morgan Stanley isn’t alone among sell-side research in hesitation towards Tesla.
Among the 32 analysts polled by Investing.com, 12 had a sell rating or equivalent on the stock, compared with 11 buy ratings. Nine of the analysts were neutral.
The average price target for the stock is $312.60, a drop of more than 37% from the current price."

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd, two sources told Reuters, as the German firm accelerates its electric push into the world s largest auto market.
The deal would mark Volkswagen s first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker and comes as the Wolfsburg-based automaker strives to meet a goal of selling 1.5 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) a year in China by 2025, including plug-in hybrid cars.
The top foreign automaker in China plans to acquire the stake in Shenzhen-listed Guoxuan via a discounted private share placement in the coming weeks, the two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Based on Guoxuan s market capitalization of $2.8 billion, a 20% stake in the company at present is worth about $560 million. 
The deal s details have been mostly finalized and the two firms are waiting for new Chinese regulatory rules on private share placements that will provide a more flexible pricing mechanism and shorter lock-up periods for majority shareholders, said one of the people, speaking on condition of anonymity.
After the stake purchase, Volkswagen will become the battery maker s second-largest shareholder with a 20% stake, behind Zhuhai Guoxuan Trading Ltd, a firm controlled by Guoxuan s founder Li Zhen, which currently holds 25%. 
Shares in Guoxuan surged by their maximum 10% on the news on Friday to trade at their highest level since March last year. 
Volkswagen declined to comment. Guoxuan and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
An executive at Guoxuan s board secretary s office told the government-backed Securities Times newspaper it had not yet received news about a stake acquisition.
SECURING SUPPLIES 
Guoxuan is among a swathe of mid-tier Chinese battery makers behind CATL and BYD. It is based in China s eastern city of Hefei, where Volkswagen is also building electric vehicles with JAC Motor, one of a number of its Chinese joint venture partners.
A third source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Volkswagen has long wanted to control a battery maker to better manage its supply chain.
To achieve its NEV sales goal in China, Volkswagen has built a new $2.5 billion electric vehicle plant with partner SAIC Motor that will have annual output capacity of 300,000 cars and is also revamping manufacturing facilities in China s southeastern city of Foshan to build electric cars with partner FAW Group.
Volkswagen has also identified CATL as a strategic supplier and Volkswagen board member Stefan Sommer told Reuters in July last year that it could even build its own battery cell manufacturing plants in China.
""By holding a stake in the top Chinese battery makers, carmakers can gain more bargaining power on battery prices,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. ""Foreign carmakers are now catching up with their Chinese counterparts on securing battery supplies in China."" 
Volkswagen s rivals in China include Tesla , which earlier this month began delivering cars from its $2 billion factory in China. The U.S. electric car maker eventually plans to manufacture 250,000 vehicles a year in the plant s first phase. 
China has been a keen supporter of NEV - pure battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrids - and has started implementing NEV sales quota requirements for automakers.

However, cuts to subsidies have dealt the market a blow, with NEV sales contracting for the first time last year. Sales this year are likely to be flat or rise only slightly, according to China s top auto industry association."

(Bloomberg) -- German rangers stand guard to shoo away visitors from a nondescript stretch of forest near Berlin, where a sign nearby warns of “Lebensgefahr” (mortal danger).

The precautions are part of the frantic activity underway to set up Tesla Inc. s  latest assembly plant, Elon Musk’s most daring attack on the German auto establishment. Workers wielding metal detectors have started combing through an area covering some 200 football fields to search for errant ammunition lurking beneath the sandy surface of tiny Gruenheide.

It’s the first stage to prepare a site that could churn out as many as 500,000 cars a year, employ 12,000 people and pose a serious challenge to Volkswagen AG  (DE:VOWG_p),   Daimler   AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG . Once deemed free of World War II explosives, harvesters and trucks will roll in to clear thousands of trees in the first stage of development. The work needs to be done by the end of February to meet Tesla’s aggressive timetable.
 The project represents a second chance for the quiet town, nestled between two lakes on the edge of a nature reserve southeast of Berlin.
Gruenheide lost out on a similar factory two decades ago, when BMW opted for Leipzig. That missed opportunity helped town officials to move quickly when Tesla expressed interest in building its first European factory in Germany, with a plot set aside for industrial use and offering easy access to the Autobahn and rail lines.
“The investment is a unique opportunity,” Mayor Arne Christiani said in his office, where a map of the Tesla project hangs on the wall. “It gives young people with a good education or a university degree the possibility to stay in our region—an option that didn’t exist in past years.”
If it clears Germany’s red tape, the plant will make batteries, powertrains and vehicles, including the Model Y crossover, the Model 3 sedan and any future cars, according to company filings. The factory hall will include a pressing plant, paint shop and seat manufacturing in a building that will be 744 meters (2,440 feet) long—nearly triple the length of the Titanic. There’s space for four such facilities.
Musk is taking his fight for the future of transport into the heartland of the combustion engine, where the established players long laughed off Tesla as an upstart on feeble financial footing that couldn’t compete with their rich engineering heritage. He casually dropped the news at an awards ceremony in Berlin in November, leaving the top brass of Germany’s car industry shell-shocked.
“Elon Musk is going where his strongest competitors are, right into the heart of the global auto industry,” said Juergen Pieper, a Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler. “No other foreign carmaker has done that in decades given Germany’s high wages, powerful unions and high taxes.”
Building a factory in Europe’s largest car market is a major test of Musk’s global ambitions. Demand in the region is flat, and buyers are more loyal to local brands. Meanwhile, labor costs in Germany’s auto sector are 50% higher than in the U.S. and five times what they are in Poland, just an hour’s drive away from Gruenheide.
Gruenheide Timeline

Under pressure for being slow to pick up on the electric-car shift, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government extended a welcoming hand to Musk. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier offered to try to ease regulatory hurdles that may snag construction. “There’s a lot at stake” in Tesla’s plan, he said soon after the project was announced.
Musk’s incursion comes at a strategically opportune time. Riding a wave of optimism after successfully starting deliveries of its China-built Model 3 sedans a year after breaking ground on a factory there, Tesla’s stock has doubled in the past three months.
Meanwhile, German peers are struggling with the costly shift away from combustion engines. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler announced thousands of job cuts last year, when German car production fell to its lowest level in almost a quarter of a century.
 For Gruenheide, the planned investment has suddenly transformed the town of 8,700 people into a sought-after location. Local officials receive development proposals on a daily basis: anything from 22-story apartment towers to U.S.-style shopping malls, said Christiani, who hopes the plant will help unlock financing for public transport, schools and medical facilities.
In the town hall, five thick binders are available for locals to peruse the project’s details, including 463 trucks expected to roll into the plant each day, a rail spur for train deliveries and an on-site fire brigade.
Tesla still has to jump through a number of hoops. Residents have the chance to raise objections, and then the company has to carry out initiatives to protect wildlife—including scaring off any wolves in the area, relocating hibernating bats and removing lizards and snakes until construction is finished. The U.S. carmaker also has to replace felled trees.
The mayor expects these hurdles to be cleared so that the first made-in-Gruenheide Teslas can roll out in July 2021."

(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to get the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox every weekday.
What’s Happening? The U.K. economy’s post-election economic optimism is quickly disappearing.
Boris Johnson’s decisive election win before Christmas was supposed to provide a much-needed fillip for the U.K.’s  sluggish growth rate, lifting near-term Brexit uncertainty and  finally allowing companies to plan for the future.
Still, signs of a “Boris bounce” aren’t too strong. While some private surveys have shown  signs of a pick up in sentiment, this week has seen  a string of disappointing data, including evidence that the economy was unexpectedly contracting before the vote.  Inflation and retail sales reports for December, which included the period immediately after the election, came in well below expectations, suggesting U.K. consumers may be losing some of their resilience.
That’s taken a chunk out of the pound, which has fallen more than 1.7% against the dollar this year. Combined with dovish noises from Bank of England policy makers, traders now put the chances of an interest-rate cut later this month at more than 70% — levels which indicate near-certainty for some in the market.
Analysts don’t see pressure on the pound ebbing any time soon:  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said today that a rate cut could be followed by a new cycle of quantitative easing. More data is due next week, with the forward-looking Purchasing Managers Index likely to influence whether the BOE takes action
“If you look at the fundamental driver behind U.K. economic weakness, it has been Brexit. And the reality is Brexit uncertainty is not going to go away,” George Saravelos, the bank’s global head of currency research, told Bloomberg TV.
Beyond Brexit

Brexit in Brief
Reassurance | EU citizens who have not secured “settled status” by the deadline of June 2021 will not automatically be deported from the U.K., Downing Street confirmed.
Big Bong Update | The Brexiteer campaign to raise funds for Big Ben to bong on Jan. 31 continues apace, with more than £222,000 ($289,000) now pledged. Lawmaker Mark Francois, who is leading the bong bid, told the BBC that Brexit-backing businessman Arron Banks has pledged £50,000.
Preparation Costs | The U.K. has already committed to spend £6.3 billion on preparations for Brexit, the Institute for Government notes in a briefing paper on government readiness. That’s roughly the equivalent of a railway extension project or two new aircraft carriers, the IfG says. Another £2 billion is set aside for 2020-2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Friday it will review a petition asking the agency to formally investigate and recall 500,000 Tesla  Inc vehicles over sudden unintended acceleration reports.
The petition covers 2012 through 2019 model year Tesla Model S, 2016 through 2019 Tesla Model X, and 2018 through 2019 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, the agency said. The petition cites ""127 consumer complaints to NHTSA involving 123 unique vehicles. The reports include 110 crashes and 52 injuries,"" the agency added. 
Late Friday, NHTSA released a redacted version of the lengthy petition that said ""Tesla vehicles experience unintended acceleration at rates far exceeding other cars on the roads"" and urged NHTSA ""to recall all Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles produced from 2013 to the present.""
The petition cited media reports of crashes attributed to unintended acceleration and complaints filed with NHTSA.
Tesla did not immediately comment Friday.
Many of the complaints report sudden acceleration incidents when attempting to park vehicles in a garage or at a curb. Others claimed the sudden acceleration happened while in traffic or when using driver assistance systems and led to crashes.
In one complaint, a driver said a 2015 Tesla Model S 85D in California was closed and locked when he claimed ""a few moments later the vehicle started accelerating forward towards the street and crashed into a parked car.""
A Tesla driver in Avondale, Pennsylvania, was pulling into a parking spot at an elementary school when the vehicle accelerated on its own, the complaint said adding: ""It went over a curb and into a chain link fence.""
Another complaint said a Tesla driver in Andover, Massachusetts was approaching her garage door ""when the car suddenly lurched forward: and ""went through the garage door destroying two garage doors."" The Tesla stopped when it hit the garage s concrete wall. 
In October, the agency said it was reviewing whether Tesla should have recalled 2,000 of its electric cars in May instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could have resulted in battery fires in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years.
The 2,000 vehicles covered by the September petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. A lawyer who filed the petition, Edward Chen, told Reuters in October that he strongly believes ""this number is much larger than 2,000."" The review is ongoing.
Last week, NHTSA said it was probing the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.
The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company s so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.

On Feb. 25, the National Transportation Safety Board will meet to determine the probable cause of the 2018 fatal crash of a Tesla Model X in Mountain View, California. The driver was using Autopilot at the time of the crash."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Around 250 Germans on Saturday protested in the outskirts of Berlin where electric car startup Tesla  is planning to build a gigafactory, saying its construction will endanger water supply and wildlife in the area.
The U.S. carmaker announced plans last November to build its first European car factory in Gruenheide, in the eastern state of Brandenburg.
Politicians, unions and industry groups have welcomed the move, saying it will bring jobs to the region, but environmental concerns drove hundreds of locals to the streets on Saturday.
""We are here, we are loud, because Tesla is stealing our water,"" protesters called.
Saturday s protest came after a Brandenburg water association on Thursday warned against ""extensive and serious problems with the drinking water supply and wastewater disposal"" for the proposed factory.
Anne Bach, a 27-year-old environmental activist, said Tesla s plans published earlier this month showed it would need more than 300 cubic meters of water per hour which would drain the area s declining reserves.
""I am not against Tesla ... But it s about the site; in a forest area that is a protected wildlife zone. Is this necessary?"" Bach said.
""In such an ecological system like the one here and with the background that climate is changing, I cannot understand why another location was not selected from the beginning,"" said Frank Gersdorf, a member of ""Citizens  Initiative Gruenheide against Gigafactory"", a local group that organized Saturday s protest.
Environmentalist protests in Germany have previously halted and delayed major companies  plans such RWE s lignite mining at the Hambach forest, near Cologne, which has become a symbol of the anti-coal protests.
Saturday s protest, which Gersdorf and Bach said developed spontaneously from a 50-people forest walk demonstration, highlighted the deforestation of around 300 hectares to build the factory and its impact on wildlife, including birds, insects and bats.
People were also protesting against an expected ""enormous"" increase in traffic on a nearby highway and through the villages.
Next to the protest, on the other side of the street, around 20 people carried banners welcoming Tesla in their village, with children chanting, ""We are here, we are loud, because Tesla is building our future.""
Bernd Kutz, a Gruenheide local, said Tesla would bring improvement to the area, create jobs and give chances to young people."

The U.S. carmaker last November announced plans to build a giant factory in Gruenheide, in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, giving it the coveted ""Made in Germany"" label just as local rivals prepare to launch competing models.
Tesla s board of directors approved a purchase agreement with the state of Brandenburg on Saturday to acquire a 300-hectare property, Brandenburg government spokesman Florian Engels said in a statement. The state parliament s finance committee had already approved the sale on January 9.
A Tesla spokeswoman confirmed the deal.
The agreement states a preliminary property price of 40.91 million euros ($45.36 million) which can be amended if an external review provides a different value, Engels said.
The property is in a designated industrial area and is being checked for weapons from World War II as there are most likely unexploded U.S. bombs still in the ground, he added.
Politicians, unions and industry groups have welcomed Tesla s move which is expected to create up to 7,000 jobs in Brandenburg."

On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it would review the petition and released a redacted version that said ""Tesla vehicles experience unintended acceleration at rates far exceeding other cars on the roads.""
The petition urged the agency to recall all Tesla vehicles, the Model S, Model X and Model 3, produced beginning in 2013. It cited media reports of crashes attributed to unintended acceleration and complaints filed with NHTSA.
Tesla said the petition was ""completely false"" and was brought forward by a short-seller.

Investing.com - There’s a new Tesla bull on the block on Wall Street, with an analyst boosting his price target to $800 Tuesday, the highest on the sell side at present.
Tesla  shares jumped 5.9% in morning trading.

New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who already has a buy rating on shares, hiked his price target to $800 from $530, noting that key elements of the research firm’s bullish thesis through 2025 have been validated over the past year-and-a-half.

""We stick to our views and expect {{0|Tesla} to sell (2 million to 3 million) cars per year after 2025, at industry leading margins, justifying a market capitalization” of $230 billion to $350 billion, about $1,100 to $1,700 per share, Ferragu said in a note.

“Discounted back to early 2021, we would see that fully priced with a stock in the $640-$960 range,” he added. “On that basis, we increase our target price to $800.""
""The stock will remain volatile, as the spread between bull and bear cases remains wide, and God only knows what the next controversy will be,” Ferragu said.
But expectations for 2020 look low and the company should handily top expectation for free cash flow when it reports results next week, he said.

Investing.com – The S&P turned positive Tuesday as investors continued to chase tech stocks higher ahead of key earnings for the sector.

The S&P 500 added 0.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.22% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.06%. 
Intel  and Micron  led a turnaround in tech stocks following bullish remarks from Wall Street.
Jefferies upgraded its rating on Intel  to hold from underperform, sending Intel 2% higher. The investment firm said it expected that management team changes and restructuring efforts at Intel will trigger a ""dramatic change"" in the next two years and boost the chipmaker s earnings and stock price.

Longbow Research, meanwhile, upped its price target on Micron  to $69 from $67, sending the stock up 2%.  

The turnaround in tech stocks come ahead of key earnings for the sector, with Netflix  and   IBM    set to report after the closing bell.

Stocks started the day on the back foot as risk-assets were shunned in favor of safe havens following fears that a spread in the new coronavirus in China could dent tourism, hurting growth ahead of the Lunar New Year.
Rising fears that contagion of the virus would keep a lid on international travel hurt casino stocks, with Wynn Resorts  and   Las Vegas Sands    down sharply.

The S&P 500 lost 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.19% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.52%.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first case of the coronavirus in the United States.

The news was met with a wave of selling in airline and casino stocks on fears that a widespread outbreak could disrupt international tourism and dent economic growth.

American Airlines , United Airlines  fell more than 4%, while Delta Air Lines   fell nearly 3%.

In industrials, meanwhile, Boeing  slumped 3.3% after the aircraft maker pushed back its timetable for regulators to approve the return of the 737 MAX to the middle of the year. That added about 73 points to the Dow s losses.

A rise in real estate, however, led by Crown Castle , Macerich  and American Tower , helped stem broader-market losses.  

In tech, FANG stocks ended mostly in the red, led by Apple , offsetting gains in chipmakers Intel  and Micron .

The milestone comes less than a month after Tesla s stock crossed $420, the infamous price at which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted he would take the electric car maker private.
Musk tweeted he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private in August 2018, when its shares were trading in the mid-$330s, only to later give up under investor pressure and regulatory concerns.
Tesla shares were last up 1.4% at $555 after the bell, building on a 7.2% gain during trading when brokerage New Street Research raised its price target to $800.
Tesla s market value also puts Musk a step closer to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package.
The $100 billion valuation needs to stay for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.
Tesla, which is already valued more than Ford Motor  Co and General Motors Co  combined, has seen its stock more than double in the last three months, fueled by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries."

Day two kicked off with Donald Trump having breakfast with American business executives, including Apple Inc .’s Tim Cook. The U.S. leader, whose impeachment trial began on Tuesday, also held talks with the presidents of Kurdistan and Iraq.

Trump Lauds Musk, ‘Disappointed’ With Boeing  (12 p.m.)
Trump praised on Tesla  Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk as “one of our great geniuses” but said he’s disappointed in  Boeing Co . over its woes around the 737 Max aircraft.
“I was worried about him, because he’s one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius,” Trump said of Musk in a CNBC interview. “You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that came up with originally the light bulb and the wheel and all of these things.”
On Boeing, he said: “Very disappointing company. This is one of the great companies of the world, let’s say as of a year ago, and then all of a sudden things happen. I am so disappointed in Boeing-- had a tremendous impact.
‘We Have to Act Now’ on Climate: von der Leyen (11:40 a.m.)
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen focused on climate change and geopolitics, the two priorities of her five-year mandate which started last month, when she addressed the forum.
“The window of opportunity is closing” to address the environment emergency but “we have to act now,” she said.
Von der Leyen said there has to be “fairness” when it comes to climate and that included protecting European businesses and workers from unfair competition.
“If you engage with Europe you will find a reliable partner, working for a more sustainable world, but we ask for fairness in return,” she said.
France’s Le Maire Hopeful on U.S. Digital-Tax Deal (11:35 a.m.)
France has agreed to put the taxation of digital companies on hold until the end of this year as it seeks to avert a trade war with the U.S., Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Bloomberg TV.
Le Maire said international rules for digital taxation would be “far more efficient” and “fairer,” and that he hoped for agreement with U.S. officials “in a few hours” after meetings in Davos.
“Entering into a trade war between the U.S. and Europe would be foolish,” Le Maire said. “And if we are ready to go this way, we would have one single taxation of all digital activities instead of having many national taxations all over the world.”
Trump Says Strong Dollar ‘Very Bad’ for Manufacturing (11:20 a.m.)
Trump reiterated his criticism of Federal Reserve policy, saying the central bank “brought up the rate too fast, and they didn’t drop it fast enough.”
“I want this dollar to be strong. I want it to be so powerful. I want it to be great. But if you lower the interest rates, so many good things would happen,” he told CNBC.
“We have a very strong dollar, and that sounds good, and it is good in many ways, but it’s very bad in terms of manufacturing,” he added.
Mnuchin Threatens Auto Tariffs to Counter Digital Taxes (11:16 a.m.)
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Mnuchin dangled the prospect of retaliatory tariffs on automobile imports if countries go ahead with digital taxation plans.
“If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies,” Mnuchin said during a panel discussion. “We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature.”
Internet companies have long been the target of complaints that they don’t pay enough in taxes, and France imposed a 3% levy on the digital revenue of companies that make their sales primarily in cyberspace, such as  Facebook Inc  . and Alphabet  Inc.’s Google.
On the same panel, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said the country plans to go ahead with a tax on digital services in April, with the levy designed to fall away once there’s international agreement on the issue.
Mnuchin said the U.S. will have private talks with the U.K. over the plan, just as Trump had with French President Emmanuel Macron to defuse the spat over digital tax.
Trump Would Be ‘Very Surprised’ to Have to Impose EU Tariffs (11 a.m.)
Trump said that he threatened von der Leyen with “very high tariffs” on “cars and other things that come into our country” at a meeting on Tuesday but that he would be “very surprised” if he had to implement them.
“They’ve taken advantage of our country, the European Union, for many, many years,” Trump told CNBC.
“They’re going to make a deal because they have to, they have to, they have no choice,” he added. “I would be very surprised if I had to implement the tariffs.”
The U.S. leader dismissed worries about a possible pandemic from a a new respiratory virus in China: “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.”
U.K’s Javid Says EU Trade-Deal Timetable Feasible (10:50 a.m.)
Britain and the European Union have set a “tight timetable” for negotiating a trade deal by the end of this year, but it “absolutely can be done,” according to the U.K.’s Javid.
“Both sides recognize that it’s a tight timetable, a lot needs to be put together in the time that we have, but it can be done,” Javid said during a panel on “The Future of Financial Markets.”
“And it can be done for both goods, where we want to see free trade, zero tariffs, zero quotas, but also on services,” he added. Work has also started on a trade agreement with the U.S., which is a “huge priority” for the new government, Javid said.
Mnuchin Says U.K. Trade Pact Is U.S. Priority (10:49 a.m.)
Securing a trade deal with the U.K. is a big priority for the Trump administration this year, Mnuchin said during the same panel discussion with the U.K.’s Javid.
Tariffs provided an incentive for China to sign the phase-one trade deal last week, Mnuchin said, adding that the U.S. is trying to open global markets, not close them. There are no deadlines to start talks on a second phase, which could be pursued in smaller increments.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the world is in a better place than it was a few months ago, as trade and industrial output bottom out and the outlook brightens.
Saudi Aramco’s International Listing Isn’t Coming Soon (10:21 a.m.)
The international listing of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) is “still on the cards” but likely won’t happen soon, Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan told Bloomberg TV.
In the oil giant’s IPO, Aramco opted for a local listing after global investors balked at its hopes of valuing the company at $2 trillion. Instead, Aramco relied heavily on local investors and funds from neighboring Gulf Arab monarchies.
Al-Jadaan said he’s “very confident” that the Saudi economy is picking up. After issuing a $5 billion eurobond, he said the country could borrow another $4 billion more this year and is considering debt in euros, riyals as well as sukuk.
AstraZeneca Sees Climate Change Bigger Risk Than China Virus (9:35 a.m.)
While the spread of the coronavirus is “a threat that must be taken seriously,” it appears to be relatively contained, AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
“I personally think there’s a much bigger threat that is facing the world today, and it’s global warming and climate change,” said Soriot. “We all need to do something about it.”
Thiam Says European Bank Mergers ‘Desirable’ (9:25 a.m.)
Consolidation among top European banks should be pursued, but work is still needed to convince taxpayers that larger lenders won’t be a threat to the financial system, according to  Credit Suisse   Group AG Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam.
“I think it’s desirable,” Thiam told Bloomberg TV when asked if European banking mergers should take place. “It will happen, but it will take some time. We still have a job to do to convince the public that larger banks can be safe and not endanger the whole economy.”
Thiam said he’s “moderately optimistic” about the euro-region economy and “still very positive” about the global economy. “It’s early days, but I think people are positive about 2020 and so are we. The U.S.-China agreement is very positive for markets,” he added.
Carney Bemoans Lack of U.S. Climate Engagement (9:22 a.m.)
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of mounting risks to the financial sector and the economy from climate change and urged the U.S. to play bigger role.
“Something which was largely on the periphery of finance has come into the mainstream,” Carney said at the Bloomberg Climate Forum. “Transition risk has become more important.”
Asked if the world could contain global warming without the U.S., the governor said: “It’s much more difficult.”
Messina Sees Future European Banking Champions (9:10 a.m.)
 Intesa Sanpaolo   SpA Chief Executive Officer Carlo Messina says Europe needs to create banks on the scale of JPMorgan Chase  & Co. in order to compete with the U.S. and China in geopolitics. That means common rules that could facilitate mergers across the bloc.
“If you look at Europe, U.S.A and China, you need absolutely to create some champions with scale that can compete with U.S.A.,” said Messina in a Bloomberg TV interview. “In the medium term in Europe, we need to have consolidation, but at the same time, we need to have rules of the game that could be the same in all the European countries. That is the problem of Europe.”
While these issues will unlikely be resolved this year, he said he expects it to happen in the future. The banking sector in Italy is under control, and Intesa’s non-performing loans are close to European levels, he added.
Staley Sees ‘Extraordinary’ Tech Valuations (8:45 a.m.)
Asset valuations are currently “quite high,” particularly in the tech sector, and vigilance is needed in case of a correction, according to Jes Staley, chief executive officer of  Barclays   Plc.
Asked in a Bloomberg TV interview what the biggest risk is to the economic outlook, Staley said: “Having been in this industry for some 40 years now, it generally starts with credit somewhere. People may get overextended and if there’s a shock to interest rates that could be quite a correction.”
Staley said there are “extraordinary valuations in some tech sectors, particularly the large tech players in the U.S.”
“When you have zero to negative interest rates almost by definition you’re going to have asset bubbles,” he added. “You want to ride that wave while it’s happening but keep your eyes wide open in case there’s a correction.”
After a tumultuous 12 months, Barclays is sticking to a strategy that keeps Staley in charge of its closely scrutinized investment bank, he added.
ABB Chairman Sees Chance for Smaller Deals (8:09 a.m.)
ABB Ltd. sees potential for smaller divestments and acquisitions ahead as it refines its portfolio of businesses, Chairman Peter Voser said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
The Swiss engineering company has identified units with 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in revenue that it plans to fix or sell. As that program continues, ABB is also expanding its reach, such as its purchase of a stake in a Chinese electric-car charging company last year. But bigger deals aren’t planned, Voser said.
“There is no talk about bigger portfolio transactions at this stage,” he said, adding that the focus of the new CEO will be on improving ABB’s operational performance and executing on the board’s strategic plan.
Fake News Is Biggest Risk: Malaysia’s Leiking (7:28 a.m.)
Malaysian Trade Minister Darell Leiking said recent indicators such as purchasing managers’ indexes suggest the economic outlook is positive.
“Continuously, we see encouraging PMI results all over the world, Malaysia as well,” Leiking said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We hope that some positiveness will continue throughout this year. The biggest risk for the Malaysian economy is a lot of fake news about things.”
Malaysia is unlikely to suffer any loss in its palm oil business from China, despite Beijing pledging to boost soybean purchases from the U.S. amid the trade war, Leiking added.
UBS Focused on Gaining U.S. Market Share (7:22 a.m.)
UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber said the Swiss bank wants to focus on its wealthy clients and expand particularly in the U.S.
“We now want to focus on efficiency in wealth management,” Weber said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “We want to maintain our No. 1 one position globally, and we want to build the market where we’re not among the top four and that is in the U.S. And really build that part.”
Negative interest rates in Europe are more a distortion than a useful tool, Weber added.
Zimbabwe Dealing With Inflation: Ncube (6:50 a.m.)
Zimbabwe is on track in dealing with inflation, even with consumer prices increasing more than 500% on an annual basis, according to Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube.
Annual inflation remains high, “but that’s expected, that happens when you liberalize a currency,” Ncube told Bloomberg TV. “We believe are on our way to deal with inflation. It will take time, but we are headed there,” Ncube said.

Analysts saw the signs of growing competition in the U.S. streaming space, a phenomenon which is likely to replicate itself abroad in the long term.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets advanced to new record highs on Wednesday as fears about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak eased, while tumbling energy costs promised greater spending power for consumers and wider profit margins for businesses.
By 10:25 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 111 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 11 points or 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 61 points or 0.7%.
Tesla  led a broad advance, breaking through the $100 billion valuation milestone for the first time as a squeeze on the many hedge funds that have shorted it over recent months and years became increasingly painful. CEO and founder Elon Musk will be eligible for up to $346 million in stock awards, although one imagines the satisfaction of thwarting the doomsters who have been his chief bugbear for the last four or five years will count for more for him.
Wedbush became the latest house to raise its price target on Wednesday, hoisting it to $550 from $370. That s the latest in a series of analyst upgrades that have followed the commissioning of Tesla s new plant in China, the world s largest market for electric vehicles.
  IBM    also rose 4.1% to its highest since October after finally breaking a sequence of 20 straight year-on-year declines in quarterly earnings. The acquisition of Red Hat last year has helped it accelerate its repositioning as a Cloud-based service provider.
At the other end of the performance scale, Netflix  fell 3.6% and was on course to wipe out all its gains for the year to date after market participants chose to focus on the downbeat part of a mixed earnings update which suggested increasingly tough competition in the streaming space.
Boeing , meanwhile, fell another 0.3% but didn’t threaten the new 13-month low that it posted Tuesday after pushing back yet again the timeline for getting its 737 MAX aircraft back in the air. The company said it now expects U.S. regulators to declare the plane airworthy in the middle of the year, raising the risk that airlines will have to go another summer without enough capacity to meet demand.
Oil and gas stocks came under pressure after U.S. crude prices tumbled on a report by Goldman Sachs  saying that the coronavirus outbreak, which has now claimed nine lives, could cut global oil demand by 260,000 barrels a day – at a time when the market is already expected to be oversupplied for at least the first half of the year.
  Exxon Mobil    stock fell 0.3% to its lowest since October, while shale players   Devon Energy    and Whiting Petroleum fell 2.0% and 4.5% respectively."

Shares of the electric carmaker were up 8.1% at $591.78 in late morning trading, continuing their furious rally that has more than doubled the share price in the last three months.
It ""speaks to the inflection in electric vehicle demand globally,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email.
""The skeptics have been proven wrong, and the $100 billion market cap is sending the bears into hibernation mode.""
The milestone comes less than a month after Tesla s stock crossed $420, the price at which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted he would take the electric-car maker private.
Musk tweeted he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private in August 2018, when its shares were trading in the mid-$330s, only to later give up under investor pressure and regulatory concerns.
""The liquidity concern for now is off the table, and that opens up the ... base to new investors,"" said Ben Kallo, senior research analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., which on Jan. 9 downgraded its rating on the stock to neutral.
A higher stock price also helps attract employee talent, Kallo said. ""In a technology sector where it is very hard to recruit and retain employees, especially in the Bay Area, the stock price helps.""
Tesla s market value also puts Musk a step closer to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package.
The $100 billion market capitalization needs to stay for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.
The recent rally in Tesla s shares was fueled by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries.
In a bullish report Wednesday, Wedbush analysts said that robust demand in China and Europe alongside ""aggressive"" trajectory of Gigafactory 3 production will boost fourth-quarter earnings. Wedbush has a neutral rating on the stock."

The Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel s office said a resolution filed in U.S. District Court recognizes ""that any Michigan resident may lawfully buy a Tesla and have it serviced in Michigan.""
The stipulation also says Tesla may ""operate under existing Michigan law; sell cars to Michigan customers as long as the sales contract indicates the sale took place in a state other than Michigan; and, indirectly own service and repair facilities in Michigan through a subsidiary, Tesla Michigan.""
Reuters and other outlets reported the expected settlement on Tuesday. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not sell its vehicles through a network of independent dealers.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk reacted to the settlement on Twitter writing: ""Yay!"" Tesla has filed a number of legal challenges over the years to state laws that prohibit or heavily restrict the ability of automakers to sell vehicles directly to consumers.
The stipulation says Tesla may operate galleries in Michigan to ""educate customers and facilitate transactions out-of-state."" Tesla may conduct demonstration drives, discuss prices, service, financing, leasing, and trade-ins with potential customers and facilitate ""ordering and purchase of a vehicle for which legal title transfers out-of-state.""

Investing.com – The S&P closed about flat Wednesday as news of more deaths from the deadly flu-like virus that originated in China soured investor sentiment, but losses were kept in check by ongoing momentum in tech.  
The S&P 500 added 0.03%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.14% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average sipped 0.03%.

Late-selling unfolded ahead of the close as sentiment was hit on reports that the death toll from the coronavirus had increased to 17, raising fears of contagion.

But tech stocks continued to shine, driven by a pop in shares of   IBM    as investors cheered Big Blue s return to revenue growth and quarterly results beat.

Chip stocks also led the charge higher for tech, with Intel  and Texas Instruments  rising 3% and 2% respectively, as chipmaker ASML s  bullish outlook for the sector lifted investor sentiment.  

A fall in Netflix , however, kept a lid on tech as the streaming giant s weaker outlook on growth raised concerns about the impact of rising competition from rivals like Walt   Disney   .

Elsewhere, Tesla  eased from highs to end the day up 4% following bullish remarks from Wedbush, who raised its price target on the stock by nearly 50% to $580 on expectations of increased demand from China.

Oil tumbled on concern the market is oversupplied.
The S&P 500 Index ended the day up less than 0.1%, lifted by gains in technology shares and positive earnings reports but held back by concern that the deadly respiratory illness could spread, even as China moved to contain the outbreak.  IBM   rose the most in four months after revenue beat estimates. Tesla  Inc.’s market value soared past $100 billion.
With stocks trading near records, investors are on alert for any developments that could derail the momentum. They have taken a cautious stance amid concern the coronavirus that has already killed 17 people could turn into a global pandemic.
“The fear is that it could hurt growth, that this could continue to have an impact on global markets that are already reeling from the impacts of trade,” said Matt Forester, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon’s Lockwood Advisors.

Investing.com - Tesla  shares hit a big milestone on Wednesday, becoming the first $100 billion publicly listed U.S. carmaker in history.
At its current share price of $569, Tesla  is valued at $102.6 billion. Tesla shares have more than doubled in value since falling to a 52-week low of $176.99 in June 2019.
After topping the combined value of Ford and GM earlier this month, Tesla  overtook Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as the second most-valuable carmaker in the world. Japan s Toyota Motor, however, remains the world leader with a market value of around $199 billion.
The $100-billion valuation triggers a $346 million payday for Tesla  CEO Elon Musk if it holds on an average basis for at least six months, the first in a series of potentially huge bonuses for Musk.
For Musk’s subsequent tranches to vest under the terms of the 2018 compensation package, the company’s market cap would have to continue to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement’s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla’s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the electric car maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.
If Tesla  ultimately achieves a valuation of $650 billion by 2028, Musk would be in line for a whopping $50 billion in incentive payments.
Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla’s market cap and milestones for growth.
The recent rally, which has seen shares soar 221% since June, was fueled by a surprise profit for the third quarter of last year, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries.
However, there are a few risks to watch out for in the current quarter and beyond. Tesla  is set to report its fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 29 after markets close.

It’s Still a Sell By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla  Inc.’s price target was more than doubled at UBS to $410 from $160, even though the bank restarted its coverage of the electric-car maker with a sell rating.
UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said in a note that Tesla has the potential to become the most profitable original equipment manufacturer. Still, he thinks the shares are over-shooting after more than doubling in the past three months, while risks in execution and U.S. demand following the phase-out of electric vehicle tax credits seem to get ignored.
UBS’s new $410 price target is still about 28% below Tesla’s closing price on Wednesday. The shares have surged of late amid a surprise third-quarter profit and strong deliveries for the fourth quarter, while the company’s market capitalization topped $100 billion on Wednesday.

Daimler wanted to sell around 25,000 EQC vehicles in 2019, but only managed to build around 7,000 for the same reason, Manager Magazin said. 
Daimler declined to comment on the article. 
The battery cell supply bottleneck comes as carmakers face huge fines next year if they fail to cut their fleet emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to an average 95 grams per kilometre.
Carmakers have been given individual targets based on the weight and size of their vehicle fleet. 
Daimler had average fleet emissions of 130.4 grams in 2018 and needs to hit a target of 103.1 grams per km by 2021, PA Consulting has forecast. 
If Daimler fails to cut its CO2 footprint, it faces a fine of 997 million euros ($1.1 billion), PA Consulting said in a report published this month.
In 2018, average CO2 emissions in the European Union rose by 1.6% to 120.4 grams per km as customers abandoned diesel vehicles and gravitated towards buying bigger vehicles. Figures for 2019 are not yet available.
Daimler s works council chief Michael Brecht told Manager Magazin that one of the reasons the company is struggling to meet battery demand is because Tesla  bought Grohmann Engineering, a battery automation specialist hired by Mercedes-Benz to build up its own battery manufacturing capacity.
This caused problems for Daimler which was in the midst of ramping up electric car battery production at its electric vehicle battery production unit Deutsche Accumotive.
The launch of the EQC has been hampered by production problems, including a recall last October after Daimler identified a potentially defective bolt in the differential.
Germany s Auto Bild magazine said the launch of the Mercedes EQC in North America has been postponed by a year, until 2021, because of the production problems.

(Reuters) - Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics would still reach its mid-term revenue target in the event of a ban of Huawei telecoms components in Europe, its chief executive said after the group published better-than-expected earnings on growing demand for its next-generation products.
Debates are raging in France, Germany and Britain as to whether to grant China s Huawei, one of STMicro s top 10 clients globally, the right to sell its telecoms equipment for use in 5G mobile Internet infrastructure, following calls by U.S. authorities for a complete ban over fears China could use the equipment for spying. 
""We re prepared for it,"" STMicro Chief Executive Officer Jean-March Chery said in an interview, when asked if the company had assessed the risk of a full ban. 
""Today, the risks and opportunities are balanced and won t prevent us from reaching our mid-term target of $12 billion,"" he added. The Geneva-based group pledged to reach that revenue goal by the second-half of 2021 or in 2022, depending on market conditions. 
STMicro, whose controlling shareholders are France and Germany, is able to shift manufacturing from China to countries like Morocco and Malaysia, if the trade relationship between China and the United States deteriorates further, Chery said. 
""We re going to move from a totally open global economy to an economy that will be more siloed, with regional strategic interests that will come before that of companies,"" he said. 
STMicro s fourth-quarter results beat analysts estimates as demand for chips dedicated to the next generation of smartphones and low-emission cars helped offset a slowdown in more traditional products. 
STMicro s results reflect a wider industry move towards more sophisticated semiconductors within the telecoms, auto and manufacturing sectors, as equipment makers gear up for the deployment of the new mobile Internet infrastructure, or 5G, and increased demand for cleaner vehicles. 
The supplier to iPhone maker Apple  and electric carmaker Tesla  said fourth-quarter net revenue rose by 7.9% from the previous quarter to $2.75 billion, above STMicro s targets.
The gross margin for the period stood at 39.3 percent. Shares jumped over 8% by 1348 GMT.
The Geneva-based company expects first-quarter sales to fall by 14% to about $2.36 billion from the last quarter of 2019, as the start of the year is generally a weaker period in the semiconductor industry. STMicro expects growth of 13.7% over the period from a year earlier.
It also plans to invest about $1.5 billion in capital expenditure in 2020.

STMicro s results came on the back of a good performance by bigger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which forecast a rise of up to 45% in January-March revenue earlier this month."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  has overtaken Germany s Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as the world s second most valuable carmaker behind Japan s Toyota (T:7203), as the meteoric rise in the U.S. electric vehicle maker s shares reshuffles the global market.
Tesla s stock has more than doubled in value in the last three months, with its market capitalization piercing $100 billion on Wednesday, a first for a listed U.S. automaker.
During the rally, its value has leapfrogged more established global rivals: Honda (T:7267), BMW , General Motors  and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). On Wednesday, it eclipsed VW s $99.4 billion value.
Toyota still holds pole position with a market cap of $233 billion.
The recent gains have been fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.
Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth.
But the gains highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla s shift from a niche car maker into a global leader in cleaner cars.
A glance at its results shows it has a long way to go before it can eclipse larger rivals. 
Based on 12-month forward sales estimates, it doesn t even appear in the top 20 in the world. The company s sales will reach $31 billion, a slither of Toyota s $276 billion, VW s $283 billion and Daimler s $191 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Tesla has agreed to buy land in Gruenheide just outside Berlin where it wants to build a giant factory that would give its cars the ""Made in Germany"" branding.
Tesla s local rivals are preparing to launch their own range of electric vehicles to compete with the U.S. company, whose decision to produce in Germany is sure to give BMW, Daimler s Mercedes and Volkswagen s Audi a good run for their money.
Unexploded bombs are often found in and around German cities, where authorities evacuate residents near the site to ensure their safety while disposal experts defuse them.

PARK CITY, Utah (Reuters) - Women directors and stars will be at the forefront of this year s Sundance Film Festival starting on Thursday, at a time when a lack of diversity among nominees has been the focus of the Hollywood awards season.
Women directed 44% of the 118 feature-length films to be previewed at the 10-day festival in the ski resort town of Park City, Utah. Minorities have directed 34%, and directors identifying as LGBTQ 15%.
Last year, women directed 40% of the official selection at Sundance.
At the upcoming Academy Awards on Feb. 9, no female directors are up for an Oscar, and stories by or about men dominate the Best Picture lineup.
""It s part of a trend at Sundance,"" said Brent Lang, executive editor for film and media at movie trade magazine Variety.
""Over the last decade the festival s put a real premium on providing a platform for female filmmakers, for under-represented filmmakers of all stripes, and I think this is a continuation of that effort.""
Kicking off Sundance, the biggest U.S. showcase for independent cinema, will be director and Emmy winner Lana Wilson with her Netflix  documentary, ""Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,"" which the streaming service says promises a ""raw and emotionally revealing look"" at the pop star.
RECORD SUBMISSIONS
Organisers of the festival founded by actor Robert Redford say they received a record-breaking 15,100 submissions this year.
Angelina Jolie stars in the children s movie ""Come Away,"" which explores the stories of Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland; Olivia Colman plays a daughter trying to look after her elderly parent in ""The Father"" and Carey Mulligan is a woman who seeks revenge after a tragic event in ""Promising Young Woman.""
Elisabeth Moss plays horror author Shirley Jackson in ""Shirley,"" Ethan Hawke plays Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla  in ""Tesla,"" and Benedict Cumberbatch is a spy during the Cold War in ""Ironbark.""
Across the documentary categories, Ron Howard’s ""Rebuilding Paradise"" shows the wildfires in California that destroyed the town of Paradise in 2018; ""Be Water"" explores the life of Bruce Lee, and the 4-part Hulu series ""Hillary"" centers on former Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Meanwhile, streaming platforms hope to use Sundance to generate buzz around their offerings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Friday urged Tesla Inc  to rebrand its driver assistance system Autopilot, saying it has ""an inherently misleading name"" and is subject to potentially dangerous misuse.
But Tesla said in a letter that it had taken steps to ensure driver engagement with the system and enhance its safety features.
The electric automaker introduced new warnings for red lights and stop signs last year ""to minimize the potential risk of red light- or stop sign-running as a result of temporary driver inattention,"" Tesla said in the letter.
Senator Edward Markey said he believed the potential dangers of Autopilot can be overcome. But he called for ""rebranding and remarketing the system to reduce misuse, as well as building backup driver monitoring tools that will make sure no one falls asleep at the wheel.""
Markey s comments came in a press release, with a copy of a Dec. 20 from Tesla addressing some of the Democratic senator s concerns attached.
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
Crashes involving Autopilot have raised questions about the driver-assistance system’s ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects.
There are mounting safety concerns globally about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
Markey cited videos of Tesla drivers who appeared to fall asleep behind the wheel while using Autopilot, and others in which drivers said they could defeat safeguards by sticking a banana or water bottle in the steering wheel to make it appear they were in control of the vehicle.
Tesla, in its letter, said its revisions to steering wheel monitoring meant that in most situations ""a limp hand on the wheel from a sleepy driver will not work, nor will the coarse hand pressure of a person with impaired motor controls, such as a drunk driver.""
It added that devices ""marketed to trick Autopilot, may be able to trick the system for a short time, but generally not for an entire trip before Autopilot disengages.""
Tesla also wrote that while videos like those cited by Markey showed ""a few bad actors who are grossly abusing Autopilot"" they represented only ""a very small percentage of our customer base.""
Earlier this month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was launching an investigation into a 14th crash involving Tesla in which it suspects Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.
NHTSA is probing a Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited the 91 Freeway, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants."

MILL VALLEY, California (Reuters) - Electric vehicle startup Rivian on Saturday displayed its pickup truck and SUV at an event in San Francisco s Bay Area and said that when their prices are unveiled soon they will be lower than has been previously announced.
Rivian founder and chief executive R.J. Scaringe told Reuters the mid-range R1T pickup truck with a glass sky panel that can change from blue to clear was about $69,000. It can travel 300 miles on a full charge. A similar range R1S SUV will sell for about $72,000.
Rivian said the large battery could go 400 miles and the smallest could go 230 miles.
Scaringe declined to say how many prospective buyers have so far spent $1,000 on a refundable deposit to hold their spot for a Rivian, but he said the reaction had been ""really positive"".
""So we re excited by that. But we now have the challenge of a lot of pre-order customers aren t going to get the cars as fast as they like because there s such a long queue,"" he said.
Rivian, founded in 2009, made waves when it unveiled its first prototype model at the LA Auto Show in 2018. It has raised $3.6 billion and counts Amazon.com Inc  and  Ford Motor Co .  as investors.
Many customers at the event were excited about the designs, but Patrick Bonsi, who flew from New Jersey to see the vehicles, questioned whether Rivian would have a Tesla Supercharger-like charging network. He owns a Tesla  Model 3.
""What I found with super charging is, if the Supercharger network is not made by the car company, it doesn t charge the car as fast,"" said Bonsi.
Scaringe said Rivian was working on rolling out a network of charging stations at key locations such as national parks, but that the vehicles can charge on most charging networks available today. 
Brian Gase, Rivian chief engineer of special projects, and employee number four was busy showing customers the batteries, saying 7,776 of them were powering the pickup truck, and one was powering a flashlight that slides into the door, giving the car a lucky 7,777 batteries. 

The first R1T trucks will be delivered starting at the end of this year, followed shortly after by the R1S SUVs, Scaringe said."

The U.S. company had said in planning documents that the factory would need 372 cubic meters of water from the public drinking water network per hour, sparking protests by local residents earlier this month.
""Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won t use this much net water on a daily basis. It s possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event"", Musk said on Twitter on Saturday.
On another environmental issue, Musk tweeted that only a small part of the forest on the property that Tesla bought in the outskirts of Berlin will be cut to construct the planned factory.
""Also, this is not a natural forest -- it was planted for use as cardboard,"" he said.
The U.S. carmaker announced plans last November to build its first European car factory in Gruenheide, in the eastern state of Brandenburg.
Politicians, unions and industry groups have welcomed the move, saying it will bring jobs to the region, but environmental groups have aired concerns and a Brandenburg water association warned against ""extensive and serious problems with the drinking water supply and wastewater disposal"" for the proposed factory.
Separately, German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Sunday that Tesla had applied for subsidies for battery cell production and research in Germany."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Halfway through a dinner at the Trump Hotel, U.S. President Donald Trump can be heard giving the order to remove the U.S ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, according to a video that surfaced on Saturday.
The video, obtained by Reuters from Lev Parnas  attorney Joseph Bondy, begins with Trump posing for photos then entering a room with a table set for 15 including a close-up of the president s place setting. 
The video from April 2018 lasts 83 minutes and most of it shows no images of the participants as the camera was pointed at the ceiling. Excerpts of the taped encounter were published on Friday by ABC News.
Halfway through the recording, after one of the participants suggests Yovanovitch is a problem, Trump s voice can be heard saying ""Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it.""
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump has said he had the right to fire Yovanovitch, a main figure in the series of events that led to his impeachment. Trump fired her in May 2019 and he told Fox News on Friday that he was ""not a fan"" of Yovanovitch.
Democrats say Trump associates spent nearly a year trying to oust Yovanovitch because they saw her as an obstacle in their efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Trump s political rival in the 2020 election, Joe Biden. 
Parnas, a former associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, had recounted the conversation in media interviews last week. Trump has said that he does not know Parnas.
After the ABC report on Friday, Parnas found a digital recording of the comments, Bondy said, and sent it to the House Intelligence Committee, which is continuing to investigate Trump s conduct.
""I was particularly gratified to see that everything Mr. Parnas has been stating about that event was true,"" Bondy said, referring to the April 30, 2018 dinner. ""It is yet another example of Mr. Parnas  version of events being corroborated by evidence in the form of recordings, emails, text messages.""
Parnas, a Florida businessman, has been providing evidence to Democrats now pushing for Trump s ouster at his impeachment trial in the Senate. He played a key role in Giuliani s effort to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine for Trump. He is now under indictment for campaign finance violations in a separate criminal case.
Other attendees at the dinner were Trump s son, Donald Trump Junior and Parnas  associate Igor Fruman, according to a shot of his place setting. 
Topics that surfaced at the dinner included cannabis financing, Tesla , Amazon , natural gas, aluminum, steel, golf and Russia and Ukraine.

Theme park operators, movie theaters, retailers and restaurant chains are suspending or curtailing operations to protect workers and limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The moves by companies highlight Wuhan’s importance as a manufacturing, shipping and business hub. The central Chinese city has more than 500 factories and other facilities, placing it 13th among 2,000 Chinese cities in Bloomberg’s supply chain database. It’s the capital of Hubei province, which has 1,016 such facilities, making it seventh of 32 such jurisdictions.
Japan-based companies have about 54 of the facilities, while U.S. firms account for 44 and Europeans about 40, the data show. Many plants are in the auto and transportation industries, and big names include PepsiCo  Inc. and  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn).
As the outbreak accelerates, China has extended the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 2 from the original Jan. 30 date to reduce travel. Authorities have also locked down cities with a combined 40 million people around the epicenter in Wuhan, as they race to contain a pneumonia-like illness that has killed at least 80 in the country with about 2,744 confirmed cases.
Cases of infection were reported in countries including Japan, Singapore, South Korea and in the U.S., which on Monday said citizens should reconsider travel to China in light of the disease.

(Reuters) - Buckle up. Tesla s quarterly report could be another wild ride for investors.
The electric carmaker s stock has more than doubled since Tesla s previous quarterly report on October 23, when it posted a surprise profit that was viewed as a milestone for the company.
Still, a Reuters analysis of Tesla s and other luxury carmakers  operating profit per vehicle - a metric closely watched by auto executives - shows Tesla  still has a long way to go before reaching the steady profits of rivals  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
(For a graphic comparing vehicles  profitability, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TESLA-RESULTS/0H001R87WBMF/index.html)
At an average of roughly $17,750 per vehicle, operating profit at luxury carmaker Porsche, for example, has been stable over the past four years. Mercedes  and BMW s profit per vehicle have been closer to $3,000.
At Tesla, on the other hand, operating results fluctuated between a loss of nearly $20,500 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2017 and a profit of nearly $5,000 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2018.
Calculating profits per vehicle allows for better comparison across the auto industry. Reuters selected Porsche, BMW and Mercedes because their cars compete in similar price segments and for a like-minded customer base.
Tesla s rally in recent months has been fueled by its unexpected third-quarter profit, a production ramp-up at its new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries. Tesla s stock was up 1% on Tuesday.
While analysts on average expect Tesla to report another profitable quarter, it would be only the fifth such quarter since 2010. For the December quarter, analysts on average expect Tesla to post revenue down 2.9% to $7.02 billion and adjusted net income of $305 million, or $1.72 per share.
Options traders expect more volatility after Tesla releases its fourth-quarter results late on Wednesday.
As of Tuesday, Tesla options implied an 11% swing for the shares in either direction by Friday. Over the last eight quarters, the stock moved 9.5% on average after Tesla reported results, according to options analytics company Trade Alert.
Porsche last year released its first fully-electric sports car, while Mercedes and BMW have released their own electric vehicle versions. General Motors  and Ford Motor  are gearing up to launch their own electric vehicles.
While the German carmakers still largely rely on combustion engine-powered cars and are struggling to persuade customers to pay a premium for electric vehicles, they have a century of manufacturing and a well-developed global sales network behind them.
As Musk s nears the first tranche of a record pay package that depends in part on increasing Tesla s market capitalization, the carmaker s stock remains among the most divisive on Wall Street.
While Tesla’s recent progress has cheered supporters, many investors remain skeptical of the company’s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow. As well as repeatedly missing targets in recent years, Musk’s mercurial behavior has come under scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders.
Tesla s market capitalization must be sustained at or above $100 billion for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of a $346-million tranche of options that are the first part of Musk s record-breaking pay package.
(Graphic: Elon Musk s big payout, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1554/1529/Tesla%20musk%20payoutf.jpg)
In the past 30 days, short bets against Tesla have decreased by almost $660 million to $14 billion, eclipsing the $12.9 billion worth of short positions against much-larger Apple  and making Tesla the most shorted stock on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Electric pickup truck start-up Lordstown Motors is pursuing a $200 million loan from a U.S. Energy Department program to retool a former General Motors  factory in northeast Ohio, Chief Executive Steve Burns told Reuters.
Burns met with Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette on Monday for about an hour and the company was holding additional talks with officials on Tuesday from the Energy Department s Loan Program Office.
""We think we are worthy of government help. We don t want a handout - we want a loan,"" Burns told Reuters in an interview. ""It s just going to be more jobs faster if we get it. We are viable without it.""
Burns disclosed the company plans to unveil a drivable version of its electric truck at the Detroit auto show in June. It hopes to begin production by year-end.
The Energy Department declined comment.
Burns said the company hopes to receive funding from the Energy Department s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program that in 2009 awarded loans to  Ford Motor Co  , Tesla Inc  and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) to retool factories, but has not issued loans since 2011. Nissan and Tesla previously repaid their loans.
The fate of the sprawling plant became a political lightning rod after GM announced its planned closure in November 2018, drawing condemnation from U.S. President Donald Trump and many U.S. lawmakers.
A bipartisan group of Ohio lawmakers wrote Brouillette last week offering ""strong support"" for the loan, saying northeast Ohio was dealt a ""severe blow"" by the plant closing.
Lordstown Motors Corp, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc , bought the plant and equipment for $20 million as part of its ambitious plan to begin building electric pickup trucks by the end of 2020.
""It s cool to bring something back to life,"" Burns said.
The company is working to raise additional funding and is in advanced talks with a large strategic investor, Burns said.
GM last year agreed to loan Lordstown Motors $40 million to acquire and retool the plant. Burns hopes to repay GM s loan ""in a few weeks.""
Burns plans to start crash-testing vehicles in July, hiring about 400 hourly workers in September and to begin production in November or December."

By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the markets this week.

1. Apple’s Done, Here Comes Tesla

Apple  came through for investors with its results after the bell today, but there will be little time to dwell on numbers before another huge batch of big-name earnings reports drops.
And the hype will be all around Tesla , a stock that’s up more than 70% in the last three months and now sporting a market cap of more than $100 billin.

Tesla reports after market close Wednesday, with analysts expecting a fourth-quarter profit of $1.64 per share on sales of nearly $7 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.

Oppenheimer, which has an outperform rating on the stock, said ahead of the results that the critical (long term) variables for the stock are whether the company can scale to 1 million vehicle deliveries, achieve double-digit margins at that level and seize a time-to-market advantage in autonomous vehicles.

As of Tuesday, Tesla options implied an 11% swing for the shares in either direction by Friday. Over the last eight quarters, the stock moved 9.5% on average after Tesla  reported results, according to options analytics company Trade Alert.

Joining Tesla in reporting postmarket are two tech giants, Dow components Microsoft  and Facebook .

Facebook is expected to have earned $2.52 per share in its latest quarter on revenue of nearly $21 billion.
Stifel reiterated its buy on Facebook on Monday and bumped up its price target to $250 from $240.

Analysts are looking for Microsoft to post earnings of $1.32 per share, with revenue of about $35.7 billion. Shares are up nearly 15% in the last three months.
Before the bell the Dow deluge continues, with component Boeing  probably garnering the most interest. It’s been in the headlines constantly with the grounding of its 737 Max jetliner after two fatal crashes and its high share price has big impact on the price-weighted blue-chip index.

Boeing is forecast to report an adjusted profit of 60 cents per share on revenue of about $21.7 billion.
Maybe even more important than the numbers, though, will be if the aerospace giant provides any more visibility on when the 737 Max could return to service. The company most recently said it expects regulatory approval sometime in the middle of this year.

Boeing will be joined by more Dow components when McDonald’s  and   Dow Chemical    also weigh in ahead of trading.

  General Electric    and AT&T  are also on the calendar.
2. Fed Looks to Be on Hold, but Watch for Hints on Months From Now

It’s not often a Federal Reserve interest rate decision isn’t the big news of the day, but while tomorrow’s announcement will still be important, it’s also considered a foregone conclusion.

The Federal Open Market Committee will release its statement on the fed funds rate at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT).

The press conference with Fed chief Jerome Powell will follow at 2:30 PM ET.

There is an 89% chance that the FOMC keeps rates at 1.5% to 1.75%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Investors will be looking for anything in the statement or Powell’s remarks that looks to take additional easing off the table for the rest of the year.
And don’t forget the specter of politics still hovers over Fed decisions.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday renewed his call for the Fed to lower interest rates, saying it would allow the United States to pay off debt.
“The Fed should get smart & lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard. We would then focus on paying off & refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!” Trump wrote in a tweet.
3. Home Sales, Oil Inventories Also on Tap

Among the last-minute data the Fed will get to consider before its decision will be the goods trade balance, which comes at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect it to have widened in December to $68.75 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 10:00 AM ET, the National Association of Realtors issues its numbers on December pending home sales.

Pending home sales are seen rising 0.5% for the month, below November’s 1.2% rise.
For the energy traders, the Energy Information Administration reports weekly oil inventory numbers at 10:30 AM ET.

Oil stockpiles are expected to have dropped by 482,000 last week, although the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise draw of 4.3 million today in its measure."

Investing.com - European stock markets headed higher Wednesday, helped by a strong close on Wall Street overnight, and some better-than-expected earnings and economic data both in Europe and stateside.

At 04:15 ET (09:15 GMT), the U.K. s FTSE index was trading 10 points, or 0.1%, higher, France s CAC 40 was up 16 points, or 0.3%, while the DAX gained 2 points, or 0.1%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index rose 8 points, or 0.2%.
Leading the way in Europe has been the banking sector, helped by strong numbers from Santander . The Spanish lender took a hit from payment protection claims in the U.K. but posted a higher quarterly net profit, boosted by a solid underlying performance in its main market Brazil.
Santander’s shares climbed 4%, pushing the banks index up 0.5%, the most among the main European subsectors.

Shares in   Novartis   AG  rose 1.4% after the Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company guided for growth in both sales and profit in 2020, citing new medicines. 

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton  also pushed higher, gaining 1.7% after recording strong revenue growth. The luxury sector has been hard hit by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China as well as the civil unrest in Hong Kong, with Asia one of the biggest markets.

On top of these solid earnings releases, economic data also surprised to the upside. French consumer confidence rose unexpectedly in January despite major strikes against pension reform, and there was a similar result in Germany. Meanwhile in the U.K., house prices rose 1.9% from a year earlier, the most since November 2018, according to Nationwide Building Society. 
Overnight the death toll from the outbreak of the coronavirus in China reached 132 people, with close to 6,000 infected. Chinese authorities have closed transport systems in and out of Wuhan, where the virus was first noticed, and at least 10 other cities, effectively quarantining millions of people.

That said, the S&P 500 rose 1%, the NASDAQ Composite 1.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, rebounding from the worst daily decline in four months on Monday.

In the U.S., most eyes will be on Facebook . The online social media and social networking service is expected to post earnings growth of 6.2%. Goldman Sachs  will also be in the spotlight as the banking giant offers up its first-ever investor day, while Tesla  is also due to report earnings.

The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy setting meeting Wednesday, and will announce its decision in a policy statement at 2 PM ET (1900 GMT), with the chairman holding a press conference 30 minutes later.
The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates steady following December forecasts that showed no change in 2020, and is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold."

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Many global companies from hotels and airlines to industrial houses are expected to have to foot the bill for disruptions caused by a new coronavirus in China, with epidemics usually excluded from insurance cover, experts said. 
With 132 deaths in China and new cases being reported around the world, companies are set to face billions of dollars in losses linked to events and travel cancellations and closure of businesses, they said. 
The virus originated in the city of Wuhan, forcing airlines to cancel flights and companies including Facebook  and HSBC to suspend travel to China.
""For insurers, the bulk of the claims from this outbreak will come from businesses, mainly travel, hospitality and event firms, followed by mortality and healthcare costs,"" said a Hong Kong-based insurance sector lawyer with a global law firm.
Risk modeling firm RMS said it was too early to estimate insured losses. 
While some large global firms buy coverage for communicable diseases, most ""standard insurance policies"" exclude such outbreaks to keep costs low, said the lawyer, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Global insurers typically cover risks such as earthquakes and plane crashes, but have been paring back exposure to certain risks, such as shipping, to avoid huge losses.
Previous viruses, such as SARS, Ebola and Zika, have also led insurers to be more cautious about exposure, with specific virus exclusions added to most basic coverage policies, industry insiders said.
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome pandemic which spread to 37 countries in 2003 caused $4 billion worth of economic losses in Hong Kong, $3-$6 billion in Canada, and $5 billion in Singapore, according to insurance broker Marsh.
Insurance experts also told Reuters that most event cancellation policies would not cover the new virus.
""A lot of these airlines and hotels are offering refunds to their customers,"" said Richard Coyle, London-based head of risk financing and non-standard solutions at Miller Insurance. ""Without adequate insurance in place, the airlines and hotels are absorbing the financial losses themselves.""
A standard event cancellation policy issued by firms in the 99-member Lloyd s of London [SOLYD.UL] insurance market and elsewhere has a ""communicable disease"" exclusion, two underwriters said.
Interactive graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2U6I2Q3 on human cost of virus outbreaks 
EXCLUSION
Companies buy business interruption policies with their property insurance to cover loss of revenue if they are forced to close temporarily, but those policies are also likely to exclude communicable diseases, an underwriter in London and insurance executives said. 
""The Asian hospitality industry is an obvious example of an industry already affected. For many lines of business ... it is common market practice to have epidemic outbreak risk excluded,"" a Munich Re spokesman said.
While some firms including Munich Re have developed specific insurance products and policies for infectious diseases, not many firms have bought them, insurers said.
The impact on tourism and transport is also likely to hit supply chains in Asia, Narges Dorratoltaj, senior scientist at catastrophe risk modeling firm AIR, said.
 Starbucks Corp   on Tuesday became the first major U.S. company to warn of a financial hit from the virus.
The Shanghai government announcement that all companies in the city would not be allowed to start work before Feb. 9 will affect companies including Tesla  Inc, General Motors  and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
While most travel insurers are likely to reimburse costs associated with trip cancellations and medical expenses for policies bought before the spread of the virus, some are excluding the coverage for select destinations now, industry officials said.

Insurers  Aviva  , Allianz  and AXA said individual policyholders would be covered if they are impacted by the virus, provided they follow travel advisories from governments."

86,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/factbox-electric-vehicle-subsidies-under-pressure-in-some-tesla-core-markets-2070369,2020-01-29,Factbox: Electric vehicle subsidies under pressure in some Tesla core markets By Reuters,"(Reuters) - Tesla  Inc s has steadily increased the sale of its electric vehicles, boosted by demand for its mass-produced Model 3 sedans as overseas sales pick up, and delivering more than 360,000 vehicles last year.
But analysts say demand for electric vehicles may sour as some governments around the world dial back subsidies. 
Below is a summary of electric vehicle subsidy policies in Tesla s core countries ranked by market size, according to analyst estimates and country vehicle registration data.
USA
The U.S. federal government is subsidizing electric cars with a $7,500 consumer tax break for the first 200,000 vehicles an automaker sells. Once the threshold is met, the tax credit is cut by half for all vehicles sold over the next six months and is then halved again for another six months before running out completely.
The U.S. Congress at the end of 2019 declined to extend the cap to 600,000 electric vehicles per carmaker. 
So far, only Tesla and General Motors Co  have hit the cap. Subsidies for Tesla finished at the end of 2019, while those for GM will run out on March 31. 
NORWAY
Tesla has seen soaring demand from Norway, where electric cars made up more than 40% in sales last year, a global record. 
The country has exempted battery-powered vehicles from the 25% value-added tax imposed on petrol and diesel engines, as well as other taxes levied on car purchases. 
The government originally considered phasing out some of those incentives by the end of 2019, but has since agreed to extend all tax exemptions until the end of 2021. Some political parties have called for a gradual reduction of incentives from 2022 onwards, although no plans are yet in place.
CHINA
Beijing has been slowly rolling back a generous five-year subsidy program for so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs), which began in 2016. It plans to phase out subsidies after 2020 amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on the funds. But China said it would not cut subsidies again this summer, an approach cheered by automakers.
Tesla s China-built Model 3 cars will still receive subsidies as part of the government s NEV program, the company said in December.
Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles in 2019 dropped for the first time in more than two years as the subsidy cuts reached new levels and have continued falling since. 
CANADA
The Canadian government last year passed a zero-emission incentive program under which buyers could receive as much as $5,000 in rebates for electric cars, and up to $2,500 in plug-in hybrids.
While those rebates only apply to cars below a purchase price of $45,000, the government has issued exemptions for some models up to $55,000.
The Model 3, starting at $35,000, is currently the only Tesla vehicle receiving a rebate of $5,000, according to government information.
NETHERLANDS
The Dutch government has extended an exemption for electric cars on purchase and motor vehicle taxes until 2025.
But the country in September decided to dial back income tax incentives for the private use of company cars beginning in 2020. 
Under the new plan, those rates will steadily increase to be even with conventional cars in 2026. At the same time, the price for eligible electric company cars is dropping to 45,000 euros ($49,923) this year and 40,000 euros in 2021.
The Tesla Model 3, which retails for nearly 49,000 euros in the Netherlands, is therefore no longer eligible for company car benefits. Model 3 sales spiked significantly ahead of the incentive phase out, according to data from the Netherlands Vehicle Authority.
UNITED KINGDOM
The British government reduced its subsidies for electric cars at the end of 2018, but still offers rebates of up to 3,500 pounds ($4,600) for 31 vehicle models.
The UK is one of the few European countries, where all Tesla models are eligible for the rebate, according to the government. 
GERMANY
Electric vehicles in Germany are currently subsidized with a 4,000 euro ($4,437) grant while buyers of plug-in hybrids receive 3,000 euros – if the vehicle costs less than 60,000 euros. 
That puts Tesla s pricier Model S (which starts retailing for 86,800 euros in Germany) out of reach, but at a starting price of 44,400 euros the Model 3 is eligible. 
The subsidies are split evenly between the German federal government and the carmaker.
The government in November made plans to increase the grants by half over the five years from 2020. 

But the German government said it is still awaiting approval by the European Commission on those increases."

Investing.com – Tesla reported on Wednesday fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts  forecasts and revenue that topped expectations.

Tesla  announced earnings per share of $2.14 on revenue of $7.38 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.64 on revenue of $6.95 billion.
That compares to EPS of $1.93 on revenue of $7.23 billion in the same period a year before. Tesla had reported EPS of $1.86 on revenue of $6.3 billion in the previous quarter.
Analysts are expecting EPS of $0.82 and revenue of $6.63 billion in the upcoming quarter.
Shares rose 6.75% in after-hours trading.
“Tesla is back on track after ramping up its production and building a factory in China that could prove a game-changer for the company’s long-term profitability,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
It’s now “in a comfortable position to pursue its growth plans in 2020 after producing very strong numbers for the previous quarter,” he said. “The company s forecast for positive cash flows and its ability to sustain growth going forward offer substantive reasons for investors to feel bullish about Tesla stock. Barring any negative surprises down the road, Tesla is set for a smooth ride this year.""
The company said deliveries in 2020 should “comfortably exceed” 500,000 units, which is higher than estimates of around 475,000. Production will likely outpace deliveries this year.
Production of the Model Y crossover utility vehicle in the Fremont plant has begun and is ahead of schedule, Tesla said.
One concern may be that auto gross margin fell 30 basis points quarter over quarter to 22.5%.
The company has been trying to keep a tight lid on costs but has also been investing in initiatives such as a new factory in Shanghai, a Semi truck, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features.
Total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion

Tesla shares are up 38% from the beginning of the year and are trading at $590.00, still down 2.29% from its 52-week high of $594.50 set on Jan. 22. They are outperforming the Nasdaq, which is up 2.61% year to date.

Global corporations are grappling with a rapidly spreading SARS-like coronavirus that has killed at least 170 people and is threatening a key growth market.
Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus that has infected more than 7,000 people, is a manufacturing, shipping and business hub. While supply-chain disruptions have been limited so far because many facilities already were idle for the Lunar New Year holiday, that may change as employers stay shut longer than normal. Local officials, including the municipal government in Shanghai, are extending the holiday until Feb. 9 or 10 in various parts of the country.
The reopening of some Apple suppliers following the Lunar New Year’s break was pushed to Feb. 10 from the end of January, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. Toyota on Wednesday suspended operations in its China plants through Feb. 9.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  posted its second quarterly profit in a row as vehicle deliveries hit a record and the company said it would comfortably make more than half a million units this year, pushing its shares to new highs.
The delivery forecast, higher by more than a third than last year s production, suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between chief executive Elon Musk and U.S. regulators.
The electric carmaker s stock, which has nearly doubled in the past year, jumped 13% after hours on Wednesday, cracking the $600 mark for the first time.
Tesla said that the manufacturing process at its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China.
The $2 billion Shanghai factory is key to Tesla s growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later increase output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y.
But the company warned of a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars because China ordered a shutdown of the factory after a new coronavirus breakout that has killed 170 people and infected thousands.
""This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages,"" Tesla s chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on a post-earnings call.
The company is evaluating whether it will be hurt by the virus and whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California plant will be affected, he said.
Tesla said it started production of the new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y at the Fremont factory this month and plans to deliver the first cars by the end of March, ahead of schedule.
Tesla already starting Model Y production was the most notable item in the release, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note.
""For a company that has always been late, this is a big improvement,"" he said.
Tesla initially did not expect to make the Model Y until late 2020 and then moved up the forecast to this summer, finally beating that deadline by several months.
COST CONTROL
The results indicate that Tesla is controlling costs better, a metric that investors have questioned Musk on before and that he was quick to talk about on the call.
""In 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y production,"" he said.
Tesla s cash balance increased to $6.3 billion and total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion in the December quarter.
And while its revenue per unit delivered rose by only 3% in the fourth quarter, operating profits per vehicle rose by roughly 19%.
(Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TESLA-RESULTS/0H001R884BN6/index.html)
Tesla, which last week overtook Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as the second-most valuable carmaker behind Japan s Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), still trails luxury carmaker rivals on steady profits per vehicle, a key metric.
(Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TESLA-RESULTS/0H001R87WBMF/index.html)
Some analysts have questioned the more than $104 billion valuation, but investors are betting that Tesla has overcome its many struggles and can compete with larger, better capitalized rivals to lead the industry in technological innovation for next-generation cars.
The company s debt pile is high as well, amounting to $13.42 billion at the end of 2019.
Tesla reported a 4.9% operating margin in the fourth quarter and said Model Y production and the Shanghai factory ramp-up were likely to weigh on margins temporarily.
Its new initiatives, which also include the construction of its first European factory in Germany, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features, are also likely to put a strain on its cash pile.
Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $105 million, or 56 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, from $140 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.
 Revenue rose to $7.38 billion from $7.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.02 billion.  "

Tesla, which has a long-standing battery supply agreement with Japan s Panasonic Corp (T:6752), said its pact with LG Chem and CATL was at a smaller scale.
LG Chem declined to comment, while CATL did not respond to Reuters  requests for comment. Tesla was not immediately available to comment on the details of the new partnership.

Last year, Reuters reported on Tesla s talks with LG Chem to source batteries for vehicles to be made in its Shanghai plant. A source had also told Reuters that the electric carmaker may source batteries from CATL in the future."

Investing.com -- The death toll from the coronavirus jumped again, although there were tentative signs of a slowdown in reports of new cases. Global stock and oil prices tumbled, and Wall Street is also set for a lower opening as a result. Tesla is set to surge to new record highs after a better-than-expected fourth quarter, while the U.S. will get its first reading of fourth-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET. And Mark Carney may do what Jerome Powell chose not to do and cut interest rates at the Bank of England, in what will be the Canadian s last meeting before giving up the governorship. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 30th January.
1. Coronavirus death toll rises as virus spreads further
China reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths, the toll rising to 170 from 132 on Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,711, up from 5,974 a day earlier.
The rate of growth in confirmed cases appears to be slowing to around 30% from 50% earlier in the week. Also, the fatality ratio remains well below that for the SARS epidemic, with only 2.2% of reported cases leading to death so far.
However, the disease continues to spread, with India reporting its first confirmed case. Elsewhere, Russia said it would close its (highly-porous) border with China. The World Health Organization is meeting again on Thursday to review its decision not to declare the outbreak a matter of global concern.

2.  Q4 GDP reading to cast light on Fed inaction

The U.S. gets its first reading of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of last year at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
Analysts expect the annualized rate of growth to have stayed at the relatively modest 2.1%, as the slowdown caused by trade conflicts with China and others continues to drag.

The update comes a day after the Federal Reserve gave little sign of easing monetary policy further in the near term, even though Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank wasn’t happy with inflation still below target and remains alert to the risk of global disinflationary trends – trends that seem likely to be reinforced in the near term due to the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy.
3. Stocks, oil tumble on virus fears again
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower as the rising death toll from the coronavirus once again rattled confidence around the world, with participants also conscious that the Fed is not in any hurry to come and bail them out again.

By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were down 227 points or 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.7%. 

That’s despite support from better-than-expected earnings late on Wednesday from large-caps Microsoft , Facebook , Mondelez  and PayPal.

U.S. crude oil futures also suffered, falling below $52 a barrel for the first time in three months.
The earnings stream out of Europe was mixed on Thursday, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock hitting a three-year low after heavy writedowns and falling margins forced it to slow its mammoth buyback program.   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn), by contrast, beat expectations, although its numbers were flattered by windfall gains in bond trading.
4. Carney to cut before leaving Bank of England? 
The Bank of England will decide at 7 AM ET (1200 GMT) whether or not to cut its own official interest rates, a day before the U.K. formally ends its 46-year membership of the European Union. 
The decision is set to be a close one, with analysts polled by Investing.com seeing a 6-3 vote in favor of keeping the bank’s key rate unchanged at 0.75%, despite a flurry of comments from policy-makers suggesting they were inclined to ease policy to shield it from a slowdown caused by Brexit uncertainty and the spillovers from the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Recent data – from house prices to the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index – have produced more upside than downside surprises, which may incline the Monetary Policy Committee to wait until it sees the new government’s spending plans in March before taking the plunge.

The GBP/USD was rangebound around the $1.3000 level ahead of the decision, the last to be overseen by Governor Mark Carney before he departs.

5. Tesla s Q4 sets it up for surge to new record high
Tesla  stock is set to hit new records at the opening after surging 11% in after-hours trading on the back of a stronger-than-expected quarterly report.
CEO and founder Elon Musk predicted that deliveries will “comfortably exceed” 500,000 this year, an increase of 35%, and also said he expected positive profit and cash flow figures to be the rule, rather than the exception, in future.
Both revenue and profit beat expectations in the fourth quarter, although revenue grew only 2%  and the profit margin fell as the higher-volume, lower-margin Model 3 increasingly dominated the sales mix."

Investing.com - Global financial markets were whipsawed this week, with stocks indices in the U.S., Europe and Asia all heading for their worst weekly loss in about four months, as concerns grew over the coronavirus outbreak centered in Wuhan, China.

China s National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths from the virus rose to 170 as of late Wednesday. The number of infected patients meanwhile jumped to nearly 8,000.
A small number of cases linked to people who traveled from Wuhan have been confirmed in about 15 countries, including the United States, Canada, France, Japan and South Korea.
In addition to the coronavirus, market players reacted to the latest figures from a deluge of big-name companies, as the fourth-quarter earnings season continues on Wall Street.

Apple  was in the spotlight on Tuesday after the iPhone maker beat sales and profit estimates for the holiday shopping quarter. The company reported earnings per share of $4.99 on revenue of $91.82 billion, both topping expectations.
The earnings beat comes as iPhone sales returned to growth, with new iPhone 11 models sparking the boost. The company also provided better than expected guidance for its fiscal second-quarter revenue.
On Wednesday, the hype was all around Tesla , a stock that’s up more than 80% in the last three months and now sporting a market cap of more than $100 billion.

The electric automaker posted its second quarterly profit in a row as vehicle deliveries hit a record and the company said it would comfortably make more than half a million units this year, pushing its shares to new highs above $600.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets pared early losses on Thursday after pockets of strength in U.S. corporate results help restrain fears about the spread of the coronavirus and its impact on the world economy.

By 10:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 89 points or 0.3%, having earlier been indicated much lower. The S&P 500 was down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%.
The market drew some comfort from preliminary U.S. GDP figures, which showed annualized growth steady at 2.1% in the fourth quarter. That meant that overall growth in 2019 slowed to 2.3%, its slowest since 2016.
“Essentially demand for US made goods and services (largely services) continued to increase at a pace sufficient to generate growth of around 2% even as overall demand slowed, as the fall in demand for goods was concentrated in imports,” said Brad Setser, a senior fellow with the Council for Foreign Relations.
A bigger than expected slowdown in personal consumer expenditures put the issue of sub-target inflation – at which Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed his displeasure during Wednesday’s press conference – firmly back on the radar, a potential early indicator of a shift to a clearer easing bias at the central bank in the coming months.
Among individual stocks, the coronavirus claimed Carnival  as its latest victim, falling 3.3% as a cruise ship operated by the company was blocked from leaving Civitavecchia outside Rome after a passenger fell ill with suspected symptoms of the disease. The virus has an incubation period of as much as 14 days, according to Chinese officials.
Elsewhere, Tesla  surged 11% to a new record high after beating forecasts for the fourth quarter and predicting at least a 35% increase in deliveries this year. The company also moved to address looming constraints on battery supplies, entering a partnership with China’s CATL and South Korea’s LG Chem.
Facebook  fell 5.9% after the company announced a 51% rise in operating costs in the fourth quarter, mainly related to tighter regulatory demands on privacy. This contributed to a sharp contraction in its profit margin in the quarter, raising fears that profitability could be permanently squeezed.
Chemicals company DuPont  fell 7.4% after issuing disappointing guidance for the coming year, while Altria  fell 7.1% after taking another $4.1 billion writedown against its investment in vaping products maker Juul Labs.

Oil and gas stocks continued to underperform as the coronavirus led to more airlines cancelling flights into and out of China. Chinese airlines alone are now cancelling nearly 1,000 flights a day. Sentiment was further soured by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), which cut back its running stock repurchases by 60% after reporting a slump in profits and rise in its net debt ratio in the fourth quarter. U.S. crude futures were down 1.8% at $52.38 a barrel."

Investing.com – The S&P remained near session lows Thursday as investor sentiment was soured on rising fears over the potential impact of the coronavirus on global growth and weakness in tech stocks, led by a slump in Facebook .

The S&P 500 fell 0.70%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.75% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.53%.

More than 8,200 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide and the death toll in China rose to 170 individuals, raising fears that a further spread of the virus will weigh on economic growth in China, which makes up about 10% of global growth.

Corporate earnings provided a sliver of respite for stocks, with Coca-Cola , Tesla  and Microsoft  impressing, but Facebook  coming under pressure amid worries about slowing growth.

Coca-Cola reported quarterly revenue that topped estimates as the launch of new products underpinned growth, sending its shares up 2%.

Tesla, meanwhile, surged about 10% after the electric automaker topped earnings estimates and pledged to deliver over 500,000 cars for the year, well above consensus of about 475,000.

In tech, Microsoft climbed about 2% as strong growth in its cloud business boosted sales to record levels, above Wall Street estimates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Thursday as the coronavirus outbreak raised concerns about damage to the global economy, with what is shaping up to be a lackluster earnings season contributing to the decline.
Shares of the social media giant  slumped 5.82% after the company warned of slowing growth as its business matured and it reported a surge in quarterly expenses.
The decline weighed on the S&P communication services index (SPLRCL), which lost 1.36%. Defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, considered safer in times of economic uncertainties, posted modest gains. 
The main U.S. stock indexes are on course for their second straight week of declines as the virus has disrupted global travel and forced several companies to suspend operations in China. 
The World Health Organization s Emergency Committee is due to reconvene on Thursday to decide whether to declare the virus, which has killed 170 in China and infected 8,100 people worldwide, a global emergency.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first U.S. incident of person-to-person spread of the virus.
""The question in this case is after it runs its course than what are you left with?"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. 
""You are left with yields that have moved lower, earnings that are struggling to deliver and an increasingly widespread view the Fed is going to have to come in and cut rates again this year.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 99.17 points, or 0.35%, to 28,635.28, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 14.14 points, or 0.43%, to 3,259.26 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 38.07 points, or 0.41%, to 9,237.09.
Earnings expectations have been slowly improving for S&P 500 companies, with Refinitiv data showing a 0.7% rise in fourth-quarter profit, compared with a 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season. But the growth remains modest with the S&P 500 roughly 2% off its record high.
 Microsoft Corp   gained 2.31% after it beat expectations for quarterly earnings, driven by Azure cloud computing revenue growth.
Tesla Inc  jumped 11.01% after the maker of electric cars posted a second straight quarterly profit as vehicle deliveries hit a record.
Altria Inc  slid 5.50% after the tobacco company said it took another $4 billion charge on its investment in Juul Labs Inc.
Package delivery firm  United Parcel  Service Inc  dropped 6.37% after it forecast full-year earnings below estimates. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Wall Street finished solidly higher Thursday, coming back from a day of mostly sharp losses, after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency, but backed China s efforts to contain the outbreak, calming fears of a global pandemic.

The S&P 500 rose 0.31%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.43%.

""I have seen the capacity and I believe (China) will control this outbreak as soon as possible,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the heels of declaring the virus outbreak a global health emergency.
The apparent vote of confidence in China s ability to contain the outbreak calmed contagion fears, which had intensified after the death toll in China rose to 170, with as many as 8,200 cases confirmed so far.

Casino stocks with exposure to China s gambling capital Macau caught a bid, with Wynn Resorts ,   Las Vegas Sands    and MLCO ended more than 2% higher.
While casino operators in Macau are expected to ""see a significant cash flow impact as a result of the spread of coronavirus, their strong credits profiles will likely shelter them from widespread downgrades,"" Fitch Ratings said.

The swing from lows in the broader market capped a day awash with mixed quarterly results.

Coca-Cola  reported quarterly revenue that topped estimates as the launch of new products underpinned growth, sending its shares up 3%.

Tesla , meanwhile, surged about 10% after the electric automaker topped earnings estimates and pledged to deliver over 500,000 cars for the year, well above consensus of about 475,000.

In tech, Microsoft  climbed 2.7% as strong growth in its cloud business boosted sales to record levels, above Wall Street estimates.
Facebook  pared some of its losses to end the day down 6% as its earnings beat was overshadowed by worries over slowing revenue and user growth.
But some on Wall Street said weakness in the social media giant is a buying opportunity."

A lawyer for Musk and a spokesman for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla shareholders have alleged Musk breached his fiduciary duties, squandered Tesla s assets and unjustly enriched himself by pushing to buy the money-losing solar company in which he was the biggest investor.
The settlement covered five current directors: Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk. Brad Buss, who was a director at the time of the SolarCity deal, was also part of the settlement, which was paid from insurance policies, according to court documents.
""Plaintiffs probably think they have a cleaner shot on the merits if the only issues they have to raise are with Elon Musk and Elon Musk s actions,"" said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.
The case was brought in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated, by an individual investor and five investment funds.
Tesla said in a statement to Reuters in September the allegations were ""based on the claims of plaintiff s lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders.""
The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, who in the past two years has settled a lawsuit by securities regulators over his use of Twitter and won a defamation trial brought by a British cave explorer.
Musk and the Tesla board also are scheduled to defend Musk s pay package at a trial in Delaware next year.
At the heart of the current case are allegations that Musk and the other board members did not fully disclose the depth of SolarCity s problems, or their own conflicts.
SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins, Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive, who were the company s CEO and chief technology officer as well as directors. Musk was SolarCity s chairman and largest shareholder, and five of Tesla s directors were direct or indirect owners of SolarCity stock.
Entering 2016, SolarCity s stock was on a sharp downward trajectory and the company was slashing its workforce and bleeding cash.
Tesla touted synergies of combining the companies in the all-stock deal, which was approved by Tesla shareholders.
After the deal closed, Tesla slashed its solar sales force and ended a solar marketing deal with  Home Depot  Inc . Quarterly solar installations plummeted and are well below levels SolarCity enjoyed in its heyday.
Tesla has said Musk s involvement in deal discussions and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed."

Equities were higher from Tokyo and Seoul to Hong Kong and Sydney, though came off their highs Friday after the U.S. raised its warning against travel to China. Treasuries were little changed, while oil prices recouped most of their Thursday loss. U.S. futures edged up after the S&P 500 Index closed higher in a late-session rebound.

While the epidemic that began in China continues to spread and the human toll mounts, the World Health Organization Thursday commended China’s efforts to contain the disease.

Fourteen provinces and cities have said businesses need not start operations until at least the second week of February. They accounted for almost 69% of China’s gross domestic product in 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations.
All the key eastern manufacturing provinces have extended the holiday. They include Guangdong, home to the tech city of Shenzhen across the border from Hong Kong; Shanghai, home to China’s largest port and a newly-built Tesla  Inc. plant; as well as Jiangsu, where  Nike   shoes are manufactured. Henan in central China, which has a large Foxconn plant making iPhones, also announced the extended break.
The extended holidays come on top of other measures including quarantining whole cities that are set to disrupt supply chains and logistics, prompting economists to expect that this virus will deal a more severe blow to China’s﻿ economy in the near term than the effect of the SARS outbreak in 2003.

107,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-2073583,2020-02-01,3 Things Under the Radar This Week By Investing.com,"
By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wild market swings came this week as a Black Swan swooped down on 2020 in the form of the coronavirus.
That lent an extra edge of volatility to what was the busiest week of earnings for the season, which also had a Fed decision a Bank of England decision, U.S. GDP and the U.K. officially leaving the EU. It’s not surprising some things may have gone unnoticed.

While stocks were still diving on Friday, investment banks were betting on a white knight to fix the economic ramifications of the coronavirus.
Telsa had another stellar week, but is there one area out its control that could stifle the stock?
And investors shouldn’t ignore the big game this weekend.
Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. In the Fed We Trust

A deadly disease emanating from Wuhan, China rocked global markets to the core this week. The S&P 500 turned negative for the month. The CBOE Volatility Index, or fear index, spiked to three-month highs. And safe havens like gold and bonds rode the wave of fear to sharp weekly gains.
In the wake of the rising coronavirus risk, some on Wall Street have warned that a 5% to 10% correction beckons for stock markets. But they appear reluctant to wave the white flag on the decade-long bull run in equities, claiming the Federal Reserve will save the day.
If China s economy comes under heavy siege from the virus ""its 18% weight in the global economy would have an overwhelmingly negative effect on the rest of the global economy,"" and likely call the Fed into action,   Societe Generale    said in a note.
  Morgan Stanley    agreed, saying the Fed won t allow an accelerated slump in stocks as ""liquidity remains flush.""

But Societe Generale is still not keen to wade into beaten-down stocks.
""In our view, it is too early to call a generalized ‘buy the dips,’ given the newsflow on the virus is currently anything but reassuring,"" it said.
J.P. Morgan is a little more daring.
""The latest health scare is likely to worsen before getting better,"" but ""past outbreaks have tended to drive only limited market falls,"" J.P. Morgan said. 
These previous health scares did not lead to a prolonged period of selling, and were a ""buying opportunity within weeks,"" it added.
2. Can Anything Stall Tesla?
It was quite a week for Tesla , which seems it can do no wrong at the moment.

It knocked its earnings out of the park, sending the high-flying stock still higher. On Friday, during the massive selloff on coronavirus fears, it ended 1.5% higher, even though its Shanghai factory could be impacted. CEO Elon Musk even dropped an EDM song entitled “Don’t Doubt ur Vibe.”
Is there any fly in Tesla’s ointment? Perhaps one is the attitude of governments towards electric vehicle subsidies.
Around the globe, the message looks mixed.






3. What’s the Super Bowl to the S&P?
It’s Super Bowl LIV weekend and while U.S. investors may know the connection to equities, the Super Bowl Indicator may have flown under the radar for global traders, especially considering all the other big headlines.
The Super Bowl Indicator says that if a team from the NFC wins the big game there will be bull market that year and if the AFC team wins, there will be a bear market. (It’s quite straightforward if you don’t get too hung up on expansion teams arising after the 1970 NFL/AFL merger and teams switching conferences.)
That means a win by the San Francisco 49ers will be good for stocks and a Kansas City Chiefs win won’t.
Noticed in 1978 by a New York Times sports writer and popularized by market newsletter, this coincidental correlation still gets attention as it’s been mostly right.
Through 53 Super Bowls, in 79% of years when the NFC has won, stocks have ended the year up.
But it’s been wrong the last four games.
For the real gamblers who can’t even wait for the big game, videogame maker Electronic Arts  ran its game simulation on ""Madden NFL 20,"" with the Chiefs taking the Vince Lombardi trophy home, beating the Niners 35-31."
108,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/the-coronavirus-is-infecting-the-global-economy-heres-how-2073672,2020-02-01,The Coronavirus Is Infecting the Global Economy. Here’s How. By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- An interconnected global economy is feeling the strain of China’s viral outbreak -- and the potential $160 billion hit in lost growth that may be on the way.
In New Zealand, a bath furnishings seller told a customer that the German-designed shower head he ordered is unavailable -- because the factory in Shanghai is closed. Out in California executives of REC Group organized a supply chain war room to plan around an anticipated trucking shortage and port logjam in China. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is rallying support for an emergency OPEC meeting on concern oil demand will falter.
Since China’s last health crisis, the SARS outbreak of 2003, its share of global economic output has quadrupled to about 17%. It’s now the biggest market for new cars and semiconductors, the largest spender on international tourism, the leading exporter of clothing and textiles, and the land where many PCs and virtually all iPhones are made. The global hit from this new outbreak could be three to four times larger than the $40 billion blow from SARS, estimates Warwick McKibbin, a professor of economics at Australian National University.
Thus far, China has absorbed most of the economic shock from the coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV, which has killed more than 210 within its borders and infected over 9,950 globally. Wuhan, the city with 11 million residents where the virus came to light, remains closed off from the world. Under a government-mandated extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, provinces generating at least two-thirds of economic output will be shuttered through next week, including Shanghai and key eastern manufacturing hubs.
All the while, the virus’s toll continues to rise -- and with it the worry. China’s essential role in the global supply chain means business owners and executives around the world are being forced to contemplate what will happen in a prolonged crisis.
“Everyone is waiting to see how this evolves,” said Miguel Patricio, the chief executive officer of Kraft Heinz  Co. The food giant has a couple thousand employees in China, including a small sales team in Wuhan. “The danger, of course, is that if this continues and people have to stay home, you start having problems in terms of distribution, production.”
Closed Doors
Four months ago, Levi Strauss  & Co. opened the doors to a flashy new flagship store in Wuhan, a booming manufacturing powerhouse that alternately gets called the Chicago or Detroit of China. The location features three levels of premium collections and a massive tailor shop. At just over 7,500 square feet (697 square meters), the location is twice as big as any other Levi franchises in China. The mega-store was heralded by top executives as a symbol of a new era of growth for the brand in the country.
Today, like almost everything else in town, the store is shut. A major component of Levi’s growth strategy in the region is temporarily stalled, joining thousands of international corporations, Chinese conglomerates and small businesses in the first wave of economic impact from the virus.
“Our priority is employees, and if the situation doesn’t correct itself quickly, we will probably remain closed for a while.” Levi Chief Financial Officer Harmit J Singh said in a phone interview.
International companies have poured into China, opening up Estée Lauder counters, Canada Goose stores and Rolls-Royce  showrooms in Beijing and Shanghai. In more recent years, they moved into the second- and third-tier cities whose populations have ballooned during the nation’s mass urbanization.
Companies with big exposure to China, from  Starbucks Corp  . to Tesla  Inc., refrained from predicting this week how the virus would affect demand, saying simply that they’d update their forecasts when they know more. Apple Inc . and  Microsoft Corp  . gave wider-than-usual forecast ranges for the quarter amid uncertainty about the virus impact.
The hope, of course, is that health officials are able to contain the spread of the virus enough to let people get back to the normal rhythms of life in a matter of weeks. A vaccine could be months or even years away, but some viruses can burn themselves out within the season. Others take longer. SARS was declared a global health emergency in March 2003 and was considered contained by that July.
The fear is that because 2019-nCoV has a stealthy quality -- symptoms can appear as late as two weeks after infection -- it will have staying power. Worst case, it could frustrate the best efforts of the world’s public health authorities and wreak havoc along trade routes and in boardrooms for months to come.
The first wave of economic impact from the virus comes at a delicate moment. Western companies have helped convert late January’s Lunar New Year festivities into a shopping bonanza, to the point where it’s become a key period for economic growth in China. This year, it’s been so subdued that consumption growth in the first quarter will slow by more than half in China from the 5.5% growth rate recorded in the final months of 2019, according to Bloomberg Economics.
It’s easy to see how. Starbucks has closed more than 2,000 outlets across China -- half of its total -- and can’t get some menu items for those that remain open. McDonald’s Corp. has shut hundreds of restaurants. Some Walmart  Inc. stores are running out of products. Walt  Disney   Co.’s theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have gone dark. Even before the U.S. and Japan advised their citizens to avoid traveling to China, airlines had curtailed flights to the country -- not because of fear of contagion, but due to lack of passengers.
Many of those coffee purchases, vacation getaways and impulse buys are lost forever, in terms of GDP -- it’s not as if consumers will buy two lattes in March to make up for the one they meant to purchase in January. Manufacturing is different. Although factories that were supposed to be reopening now will remain closed, many have some wiggle room to make up for lost time, pay employees some overtime and finish off their orders.
But with every passing day, there’s less room to maneuver. Construction activity that was paused over the winter, especially in the colder northern parts of China, should be starting up by now. Capital spending is likely to be reined in as companies delay decisions until they know more about the virus’s impact.
The many companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing need to place orders soon to have products ready for peak shopping times.
Take Anne Harper, founder of OMG Accessories, a New York-based company that sells bags and backpacks to Macy’s Inc.,  Nordstrom Inc  ., Dillard’s Inc., TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores Inc. Even before the Lunar New Year, she works to lock in orders with her supplier near Guangzhou to ensure she gets priority after the holiday. Customers want the product by May or June for back-to-school season, when some customers will sell 80,000 backpacks in a single week. That means OMG tries to fill its warehouse by April.
“Making those deliveries is just so important for the life cycle of our product,” Harper said. “If you miss delivery, everyone has already bought their school bags.”
The outbreak will also have a wide-ranging impact on the technology industry, with China accounting for about 21% of global IT hardware spending, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Jan. 29. Some of the biggest PC makers and parts suppliers are based in China, and if there’s a slowdown in sales, that would constrain demand for Microsoft’s Windows operating system software.
Apple, Tech
More than 50% of the more than $470 billion of chips that are sold each year are either used in devices sold in China or go there to be put into gear sold around the world.
Apple has roughly 10,000 direct employees in China, and its supply chain has a few million workers manufacturing products like the iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch. The Cupertino, California-based company prepares for extreme scenarios like the coronavirus by mandating that major components be dual-sourced -- both in terms of vendors and geography -- and a major immediate impact to its production plans is unlikely for now, a person familiar with its operations said this week. Even so, most of its assembly work is done in China, and so a shortage of workers for assembly lines will have a direct impact on shipment numbers.
On the other side of the equation are small manufacturers in China whose livelihood depends on the confidence of their customers. Any hesitance from clients can cause disarray for people like Cash Liu, a sales director at hot-tub maker Shenzhen Kingston Sanitary Ware.
“Some of our clients choose to wait and see and hold off from placing orders, due to concerns over the coronavirus,” Liu said via a messaging app. “Thus we are likely to miss the peak season of sales to Europe in March.”
Add up the effects of lower consumption, investment and a pause in manufacturing, and the impact from the virus could knock China’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth down to 4.5% -- the lowest since the quarterly data begins in 1992 -- from 6% in the final three months of 2019, estimated Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics. The biggest knock-on effects would be felt by Hong Kong, followed by South Korea and Japan, she wrote. Germany and Japan might take a 0.2% hit to GDP, while the U.S. and U.K. would absorb a 0.1% blow.
It’s survivable, and fiscal stimulus from Beijing could even lessen the blow. On the other hand, the estimate assumes the outbreak is contained to China. And “the longer factory output is affected, the bigger the risk China’s dominant position in global supply chains disrupts activity elsewhere,” the economist wrote.
Shell (LON:RDSa) Shock
Within and outside China’s borders, the virus is bringing up flashbacks to the height of last year’s trade war with the U.S., when global companies raced to find alternatives to their Chinese suppliers and avoid tariffs.
The outbreak could spur more businesses to move manufacturing to the U.S. and Mexico, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business this week. What’s clear is that the virus is adding another layer of complexity for businesses that were just beginning to breathe a sigh of relief over trade tensions.
“This virus outbreak may be even a bigger hit to us than the U.S.-China trade war,” said Melissa Shu, export manager at E.D. Opto Electrical Lighting Co.’s auto-parts factory in Zhenjiang City.
Decades of globalization have made leaders at large corporations comfortable with the logistical challenge of moving resources from place to place and responding nimbly to geopolitical shifts. But 2019 was a lot for anyone to handle, and the thought of contending with a potentially lethal virus in 2020 is giving even the most hardened executives pause.
“Between the virus and the tariffs and the protests in Hong Kong -- I’m waiting for the locusts,” said Emanuel Chirico, CEO of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH Corp . He said it’s too early to determine the impact the virus will have on the apparel industry."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – Wall Street rose Monday, but was off earlier highs on rising fears that the coronavirus is now likely to become a pandemic as more cases of the disease were identified over the weekend.

The S&P 500 rose 0.91%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.48% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.70%. 
The number of cases of the virus rose to 17,200, with the first death reported outside China in the Philippines prompting experts to warn of an impending pandemic as China battles to contain the virus.
With fears that the virus will take an economic toll on China s economy, leading to a slowdown in the global economy, the People s Bank of China said it would inject a stimulus of $21.7 billion to ease the impact.
""Roughly two-thirds of the Chinese economy closed or impacted, and economists anticipate the coronavirus will have a deeper and more lasting impact than the SARS epidemic which subtracted an estimated 0.8%-1.0% from annual Chinese GDP growth,"" Stifel said.
The bullish start to the week for stocks was led by a sharp upswing in consumer discretionaries thanks to strong gains for sector stalwarts like   Nike    and Ulta Beauty .

 Nike   rose about 4% after UBS upgraded its rating on the company to buy from neutral and its price target to $136 from $103. The athletic footwear and apparel maker’s product innovation investments and e-commerce business are expected to boost growth, UBS said.
In addition, J.P Morgan added the stock to its Analyst Focus List.
Goldman Sachs upgraded Ulta Beauty  to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $307 from $285, citing a favorable valuation at current levels. There is little chance that of Ulta s operating margins ""unraveling"" in the event that its sales growth slows further, the investment bank said.
Investor sentiment on risk was also supported by a rebound in manufacturing in January.
ISM manufacturing data  for January showed an uptick to 50.9, beating expectations of 48.5. 
Energy lagged the move broader move higher, weighed down by a fall in oil prices as investor worries about slowing oil demand amid a drop in air travel continued.

By Kim Khan 

Investing.com - Tesla  shares continued their breathtaking run Monday, blowing past $700 per share and gaining more than $100 in the session.

Tesla stock jumped 16% in afternoon trading, getting as high as $769 per share earlier, showing the hallmarks of a short squeeze.

Another price target hike for the stock arrived from the sell side, with Argus boosting its forecast for shares to $808, near the highest on Wall Street. Argus maintained its buy rating on the stock.
""Our positive view assumes continued revenue growth from the legacy Model S and Model X, as well as strong demand for the new Model 3, which accounted for more than 80% of 4Q19 production,” Argus analyst Bill Selesky wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider.

“Despite past production delays, parts shortages, labor cost overruns, and other difficulties, we expect Tesla to benefit from its dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and to improve performance in 2020 and beyond,"" Selesky said.
But with the way shares are running the way they are, the new price target could be eclipsed by midweek.
 
Earlier, Chinese battery maker CATL confirmed it had signed a deal to supply the automaker. Tesla  has recently commissioned its new factory in Shanghai and had flagged last week that it had diversified battery suppliers beyond traditional partner Panasonic.

Those short Tesla must be wondering what has to happen to the stock to retreat. Even amid Friday’s broad and bloody selloff, shares ended in the green."
113,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/panasonic-thirdquarter-profit-rises-3-beating-estimates-2074112,2020-02-03,Tesla up 17% after Panasonic posts first quarterly profit at battery business By Reuters,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Noel Randewich
TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla  Inc s stock surged 17% on Monday, taking its rise since early June to over 300%, fueled by a quarterly profit at Panasonic s battery business with the U.S. car maker and an investor report predicting its shares would rise more than ten-fold by 2024.
Shares of Tesla have rallied over 30% since the car maker run by Chief Executive Elon Musk posted its second consecutive quarterly profit last Wednesday, which was viewed as a milestone for the company competing against established heavyweights including General Motors Co  and BMW. 
The stock on Monday was on track for its largest one-day gain since October after Panasonic Corp reported the first quarterly profit in its U.S. battery business with Tesla, which followed years of production troubles and delays.
That added to recent gains driven by Tesla s better-than expected financial results and ramped up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.
""We are catching up as Tesla is quickly expanding production,"" Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda told an earnings briefing, referring to battery cell production.
""Higher production volume is helping to push down materials costs and erase losses.""
Musk last April said that battery production had become a constraint on output of Tesla s Model 3 sedans.
Adding to jubilance around Tesla, investment management firm Ark Invest, in a note dated Jan. 31, said it expects the company s stock to hit $7,000 by 2024, compared to its current price of $754. It based that prediction in part on Tesla launching a fleet of profitable ""robotaxi"" autonomous cars. 
Musk told investors last April that robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, a claim met with skepticism by experts who said the company s technology was nowhere near ready.
Tesla s recent rally has pummeled short sellers. Almost $16 billion worth of Tesla s shares are currently short sold, making the company the most shorted on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.
Panasonic first invested in Tesla in 2010 and announced its partnership in building the U.S. firm s Gigafactory plant in Nevada in 2014 as part of its strategic shift from low-margin consumer electronics to automotive components.
But as its $1.6 billion Gigafactory investment failed to produce solid returns, Panasonic has grown cautious about its battery business with Tesla.
It chose not to build a new battery plant for Tesla in China, ceding its battery cell monogamy as Tesla entered into a partnership with South Korea s LG Chem Ltd and China s CATL.
""We will focus on demand at Gigafactory for Model 3 and Model Y,"" Umeda said. 
Panasonic is turning to Toyota Motor Corp for battery partnership, setting up a joint venture for electric vehicle (EV) batteries in April.
Panasonic said operating profit for the October-December quarter rose 3% to 100.4 billion yen ($915 million), beating analysts  estimates by 49%, thanks to the improvement at the Tesla battery business as well as cost cuts.
It maintained its profit forecast for the year through March at 300 billion yen, above an average estimate of 295.14 billion yen by 20 analysts.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P bounced back from a rout last week, with investors pouring into beaten-down stocks as China s efforts to limit the impact on global growth from the coronavirus and strong U.S. stronger manufacturing data supported sentiment.  

The S&P 500 rose 0.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.34% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.51%.

Fears about a significant slowdown in China denting global growth eased somewhat after the People s Bank of China said it would inject stimulus of $21.7 billion to curb the expected impact on the economy.

The action by China s central bank stoked hopes that other central banks could follow suit and adopt ultra-easy monetary policy in the event of a pandemic.

But Allianz  Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian warned that central banks were nearing a point where they are ""ineffective if not counterproductive"" in solving current issues.

Beyond virus concerns, consumer discretionary raked up gains on a rally in   Nike    and Ulta Beauty  amid favorable upgrades from analysts on Wall Street.

Nike rose about 3% after UBS upgraded its rating on the company to buy from neutral and its price target to $136 from $103. The athletic footwear and apparel maker’s product innovation investments and e-commerce business are expected to boost growth, UBS said.
In addition, J.P Morgan added the stock to its Analyst Focus List.

Goldman Sachs upgraded Ulta to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $307 from $285, citing a favorable valuation at current levels. There is little chance that of Ulta s operating margins ""unraveling"" in the event that its sales growth slows further, the investment bank said. Shares were up nearly 3%.
A rebound in manufacturing, meanwhile, also added conviction to the rally on Wall Street.

ISM manufacturing data for January showed an uptick to 50.9, beating expectations of 48.5. 

The energy sector kept gains in check, however, as oil prices fell into a bear market, down more than 20% from their recent peak amid ongoing worries about the virus impact on air travel."

The shift has even drawn companies more used to doing business in showrooms, such as carmakers Tesla  and Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn), to promote products heavily online during the week.
Chinese travel and gather with family and friends during the traditional Lunar New Year holiday, but many postponed or canceled their plans over concerns sparked in mid-January about the spread of a new virus that has killed 420.

Investors have seized on the trend, with shares of Chinese game publishers, such as Tencent (HK:0700), rising 2% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, outstripping a rise of 1% in the benchmark (HSI), while in New York, NetEase  rose nearly 3%.

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said it will suspend production in South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak disrupting parts supply, becoming the first major automaker to do so outside of China.
The flu-like virus has killed more than 400 people and its economic impact has spread beyond mainland China.
In China, global automakers have already extended factory closures in line with government guidelines including Hyundai, Tesla , Ford , PSA  Peugeot  Citroen , Nissan (T:7201) and Honda Motor (T:7267).
""Hyundai and Kia may be more affected as they tend to import more parts from China than other global automakers,"" said Lee Hang-koo, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. 
Hyundai has built up a huge production capacity in China over the past two decades.
""South Korean parts makers followed and built their own facilities along with Hyundai,"" Lee said. 
South Korea imported $1.56 billion worth of auto parts from China in 2019, up from $1.47 billion in 2018, trade data show. 
Most of Hyundai s South Korean factories will be fully idled from Feb. 7, while some production lines are expected to restart on Feb. 11 or Feb. 12, a union official said, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.
Schedules for suspension will vary by production line, a Hyundai spokeswoman said. 
 EMERGENCY 
The move follows a shortage of wiring harnesses which Hyundai sources mainly in China, industry officials said. 
Two of the affected suppliers, Kyungshin and Yura Corporation, said they were trying to boost production at their factories in South Korea and Southeast Asia to compensate for the disrupted supply from China. 
They both also plan to resume production at their Chinese factories after Feb. 9. 
""We are in an emergency,"" a Kyungshin official told Reuters.
Hyundai has seven factories in South Korea, catering to the local market and the United States, Europe, Middle East and other markets. 
Hyundai s production in South Korea accounts for about 40% of its global output. 
Hyundai s decision to halt assembly lines at home could delay supplies of its popular sport utility vehicles (SUVs) such as the Palisade and Genesis GV80.
The automaker recently turned in its best quarterly profit in more than two years and said it was on track for higher profit margins, aided by more sales of SUVs. 

The virus outbreak may slow manufacturing activities in automobiles and other sectors, Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co (T:8031) has warned. "

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply higher Tuesday, helped by a rebound in China after the country’s central bank moved to underpin the markets. The continuing earnings season on Wall Street and the latest political maneuvering will also be in focus.

At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 36 points, or 1.1%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 117 points, or 1.3%, while the Dow futures contract rose 309 points, or 1.1%. 
Earlier Tuesday, financial markets on the Chinese mainland reversed some of the steep losses of Monday. The blue-chip Shanghai Composite index closed over 1% higher, compared with Monday’s drop of 7.7%, thanks mainly to the People s Bank of China saying it will inject a total of 500 billion yuan into the money market to ""maintain reasonable and adequate liquidity in the banking system during the period of epidemic prevention and control.""
The country s central bank had already trimmed interest rates and injected 1.2 trillion yuan into the markets on Monday, although most of that was rolling over liquidity it had provided before the holidays.
Signs that the Chinese authorities will do whatever is necessary to curb the impact of the coronavirus have helped the tone on Wall Street. With this in mind, the focus will turn back to the ongoing earnings season.

Google parent Alphabet  reported after hours Monday, missing analysts  estimates while offering up its worst fourth-quarter revenue growth since 2015. Alphabet stock dropped 3% premarket.

Walt   Disney    is set to report its fiscal first quarter 2020 figures after the market closes later Tuesday, and the market will be looking for guidance about its new streaming service, as well as any coronavirus impacts on its theme parks and movie box office expectations.

Ford  is also set to report fourth quarter earnings Tuesday. The automaker reported a lackluster previous quarter, and analysts expect another contraction in revenue as well as subdued earnings - and that’s before the problems in China are accounted for.
The earnings season has generally been a positive one for Wall Street this quarter, with almost 70% of companies which have already reported beating expectations.

Elsewhere, Tesla  stock is likely to stay in focus after melting up almost 20% Monday. Sentiment surrounding the company is very positive in the wake of the company s fourth-quarter results and guidance for 2020. The stock pushed 7.5% higher premarket to $838.50, a gain of nearly $200/share from Friday s closing price of $650.57.
Eyes will also be on the State of the Union speech by U.S. President Donald Trump as his impeachment trial continues. He is widely expected to be acquitted on Wednesday, and the technology problems and reporting inconsistencies which kept Iowa Democratic Party officials from releasing results from Monday’s caucus can only help his reelection prospects.

Economic data releases of note Tuesday include the Redbook at 08:55 AM ET (1355 GMT) and December factory orders at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), before the American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly data on U.S. inventories at 4:30 PM ET (2130 GMT).
AT 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), U.S. crude futures climbed 1.3% to $50.76 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $54.76, still below the $55 level after Monday’s drop below that level for the first time since the end of 2018.

These prices have been helped by the news that technical experts from OPEC+ expected to meet at the cartel’s Vienna headquarters later in the day to study the disease’s impact. There has been talk that the group will decide to cut production to try and raise prices from these weak levels."

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Wall Street opened sharply higher on Tuesday helped by a big liquidity injection into local markets by the Chinese central bank.
But one stock in particular hogged participants’ attention.

Tesla  stock shot up another 16% to a new record high as the company’s recent rally sucked in more and more momentum-based traders. The stock has received several upgrades from Wall Street analysts since a fourth-quarter report that appeared to end most doubts about its ability to scale up production.

CEO and founder Elon Musk said at the time that he expected profit and positive cash flow to be the norm in future quarters after a difficult couple of years in which he repeatedly had to tap the capital markets to build new production capacity in the U.S. and China.

By 10:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), Tesla stock was at $879.96, up 12.8% on the day but still comfortably off an intraday high of $940.00.
That price valued it at $159 billion, or just over six times its trailing 12-month sales – a valuation more usually seen in tech stocks than in autos.
The surge means more pain for those who have shorted Tesla  stock. Short interest in the stock was 18% of the free float at the start of trading, according to data compiled by Shortsqueeze.com.

Elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 434 points, or 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was up 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%.
Overnight, the People’s Bank of China had nipped in the bud a rout in Chinese financial markets, pumping 500 billion yuan (over $71 billion) into the market to “ensure adequate liquidity” as the country grapples with an economic seizure caused by the novel coronavirus.

Optimism was bolstered by a healthy 1.8% rebound in December factory orders in the U.S. – albeit November’s number was revised down to a 1.2% drop from the -0.7% originally reported.

There were also signs that markets were pricing in a higher chance of President Donald Trump’s reelection in November after the chaotic Democratic caucuses in Iowa, which gave an unflattering picture of the party’s internal state.
One large-cap missed out on the rally, however. Alphabet  stock fell 4% after the Google parent posted disappointing revenue growth and profit for the fourth quarter. The company published a more detailed breakdown of its revenue than usual, but analysts were underwhelmed to realize that YouTube appeared to squeeze less than $8 out of its average user last year.  

Gilead Sciences , whose antiviral remdesivir drug (which still needs regulatory approval) was successfully used on a coronavirus patient last week, saw its stock rise 1.2% after it reported its quarterly earnings."

The near 10,000% potential winnings accruing to traders who held out-of-the-money call options.
Shares in the electric-car maker have soared more than 60% in six days to top $900 for the first time. Options traders who held calls that pay out at $800 have done even better, after they jumped from 25 cents to close at $24.22 Monday. The $1,000 calls rose from 2 cents to $1.98, a surge of 9,800%.
Tesla Has Already Doubled This Year on Musk’s Electric Dominance
The fortunes allegedly minted via Tesla options have, naturally, corresponded with a surge in their popularity. The 10-day average call option volume more than doubled since early December, as has the underlying security. On Monday, 1.8 Tesla calls traded for every S&P 500 call, the biggest gap on record according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
There’s an element of circularity at play, but this activity may be contributing to the rally in the shares. When a trader buys a call, the dealer who sells it will typically buy a certain amount of stock in the underlying to offset their exposure. If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases."

The stock soared to $900 for the first time on Tuesday; that s on the back of a 20 percent one-day surge Monday - its best one-day gain in 7 years.
The latest catalyst for the Tesla run up?
Investors are betting Tesla is way ahead of the competition when it comes to battery technology for electric vehicles.
Its partner Panasonic announced Monday that the battery venture it has with Tesla has turned profitable for the first time.
Panasonic says the demand for Tesla batteries is so brisk - it is expanding production to keep up - that s a sign Tesla may be turning the corner on the bottleneck that Elon Musk last year described as production hell.
Tesla shares have already doubled this year - and we re only a few weeks in.  Tesla now is the world s second most valuable car company behind Toyota and has a bigger market value than General Motors  and Ford combined even though it sells far fewer cars.
There are analysts out there who question that valuation since Tesla still doesn t generate the kind of cash its larger rivals do, which can be poured back into innovation.
But investors are betting big on Musk s vision of the future - which after some mis-steps is starting to show success...
It s delivering vehicles at its highest pace ever, planning to ramp up production this year and turned a profit for the second quarter in a row."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P rallied sharply Tuesday on easing fears about the new coronavirus  impact on global economy as China s aggressive measures to limit the economic fallout from the virus boosted sentiment.

The S&P 500 rose 2.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.6%.

For a second-straight day, China introduced stimulus measures to steady business lending and offset the economic impact from the coronavirus, which has killed more than 400 people.
Sentiment on risk was also supported by data showing that the coronavirus may not be as deadly as many feared.  
The coronavirus death rate was 2.1%, lower than SARS  9.6%, according to China’s National Health Commission.
Despite the efforts from China, Goldman Sachs estimated that the global gross domestic product growth this year could fall by 0.1-to-0.2% even if infections slows significantly in February and March.

""The near-term impact is quite large,"" Goldman’s chief economist Jan Hatzius said. ""What happens to 2020 as a whole really depends on how quickly the episode is brought under control.""

But Google-parent Alphabet  proved an exception to rally, falling about 3%, after the tech giant reported a miss on revenue, led by weakness in its core advertising business.
Ralph Lauren  surged 12% after its topped quarterly results as price hikes for its winterwear collection boosted margins.
In the wake of easing coronavirus fears, oil prices rebounded after falling into bear-market territory a day earlier, pushing energy stocks higher.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The Nasdaq closed at record highs Tuesday, led by a surge in shares of Tesla  as the electric automaker continued its drive higher following its upbeat results last week showing record deliveries.

The S&P 500 rose 1.5% to close at a record high, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.10% to a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.44%.

Tesla was soaring, but saw sharp selling just before the close. There were unconfirmed rumors of a seondary offering, but shares still ended the day 15% higher. Shares have been on fire this week, with rises showing the hallmarks of a short-covering rally.

""(M)any have attributed the ascent to short-sellers who bet against the stock and may have to cover their positions as Tesla stock leaps higher,"" Wedbush said in a note.  ""Half of what we ve seen is just a historic short-covering rally for the ages. That s put gasoline on the fire for the Tesla  bull story.""

Tesla regained its position as the most-shorted stock in the U.S. at the end of January, according to data from financial-analytics firm S3 Partners.
The broader market, meanwhile, was also lifted by growing expectations that central banks will act should the outbreak of the coronavirus intensify and threaten global growth.
China introduced stimulus measures for a second-straight day in a bid to steady business lending following the rapid spread of the virus, which has killed 400 people and infected more than 20,000.
For weeks, the rapid spread of the virus had raised worries that the death toll could pick up pace, but new information suggests the death rate is not as bad as initially feared.
The coronavirus death rate was 2.1%, lower than SARS  9.6%, according to China’s National Health Commission.

Google-parent Alphabet , however, failed to join on the rally, falling 2.5%, pressured by its mixed quarterly report."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A nearly 14% gain in Tesla  Inc s stock on Tuesday was likely sparked by investors looking to hop aboard its remarkable rally, rather than a reversal of bearish bets, an analysis of positioning dynamics showed.
While the share price has more than doubled so far this year to $887.06, the gains do not appear to have sparked a reversal of the sizeable short position in them. Short sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price. As Tesla has rallied 36.4% over the past two days, short sellers have incurred $5.7 billion in paper losses.
Short interest, a measure of how much money is betting on the stock to go lower, has not declined nearly enough to account for the surge in trading volume for Tesla s shares, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
One factor driving the rally may be fund managers hurrying to raise their allocation of the stock, said Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors.
Some fund managers whose portfolios are benchmarked to the Russell 1000 and Russell 1000 Growth indexes may have avoided loading up on Tesla shares due to their volatility and subpar performance in 2019 compared to those benchmarks, he said.
""Last year, it was a name that was tough to own,"" Lee said. ""People have a lot of catching up to do.""
Some options traders are positioning for even more gains in the electric carmaker s shares.
The most active Tesla options by trading volume on Tuesday were for calls that could be exercised should Tesla s share price hit $1,000 by Friday, according to options analytics platform Trade Alert. Those options jumped tenfold to $20 on Tuesday from just $1.98 the previous day.
""It seems to me like there s rampant, crazy speculation,"" said Henry Schwartz, founder of Trade Alert.
While many investors have said the big gains in Tesla are not supported by fundamentals, few may be willing to bet against the recent rally."

Tesla currently has two gigafactories in the U.S. and one in Shanghai, China. The carmaker in November announced plans to build its first European factory and design center near Berlin.
During an earnings conference call last week, Musk said that Tesla needs to increase its battery capacity to produce high-capacity models like Cybertruck.
""We ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today. That s the real problem,"" he said.
Tesla shares have been on a tear recently, more than doubling the company s market value since the start of the year as more investors bet on Musk s vision. The stock, which closed up 14% on Tuesday at $887.06, has surged nearly 400% since early June.

Investing.com -- Stock markets jump on tentative reports of progress in developing drugs to fight the coronavirus, whose impact continues to reverberate as Apple  supplier Hon Hai warns of a hit to production. Pete Buttigeig wins in Iowa while President Trump and Speaker Pelosi trade insults at the State of the Union speech. The ADP  payrolls report for January is due, along with the ISM s non-manufacturing survey. And NYSE owner ICE  confirms it looked at a bid for eBay , while General Motors  and Qualcomm  head another long list of earnings Wednesday. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 5th February.
1. Coronavirus toll nears 500; markets grasp at news of drug progress
The death toll from the coronavirus reached 493, another rise of over 16% on the previous day, but more than twice as many people infected by the disease have now recovered. Fatal cases remain highly concentrated in the Hubei region around Wuhan, where the outbreak originated.
Markets in Europe picked up on reports of progress by lab researchers with drugs aimed at treating the disease, while an institute in Wuhan applied for a patent on an antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences , threatening to revive U.S.-China tensions over intellectual property.
Apple  supplier Hon Hai revised down its sales outlook for the year citing the virus, while Disney said it expects the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong to hit operating profits by a combined $175 million.
2. Stocks, oil set for higher opening on virus optimism
U.S. stock markets are set for another strong opening, helped by more solid gains in Asia and Europe overnight, which in turn reflected the Chinese central bank’s liquidity measures this week and the – still somewhat speculative - reports of progress in finding drugs to treat the coronavirus.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were up 264 points or 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.0%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite had ended up 1.3% while in Europe, the Stoxx 600 was up 1.1%.

Crude oil futures had rebounded overnight after dipping below $50 for the first time in a year. U.S. crude futures were up 2.9% at $51.06 a barrel, while gold futures were flat at $1,556.15 and the U.S. 10-Year benchmark Treasury yielded 1.64%, up three basis points from late Tuesday. 
The bounce in crude is set to be tested by the release of government inventory data at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT).
3. GM earnings in focus after Ford slumps; ICE-eBay tie-up also eyed

Earnings seasons grinds on, with the focus Wednesday falling on General Motors after Ford Motor slumped 10% in after-hours trading on the back of a gloomy outlook for 2020. Ford’s figures made for an interesting counterpoint to the wild, but volatile, surge in Tesla  stock on Tuesday amid signs that the company’s valuation had lost all relation to any realistic development in sales and profit in the near term.

Also reporting in the course of the day are pharma giant Merck, Humana, Boston Scientific , Spotify and Metlife. Qualcomm completes day s action after the bell.
Another stock likely to be in focus Wednesday is Intercontinental Exchange Group. ICE , which owns the New York Stock Exchange, confirmed late on Tuesday it had offered to buy struggllng online marketplace eBay , in a radical departure for a group which has so far concentrated only on wholesale financial markets. ICE stock, which fell 7.5% on Tuesday on initial reports of talks, recovered 0.8% in after-hours trading as it emerged that no talks were currently in progress.
4. ADP s report to trail Friday payrolls ballyhoo
ADP  will update the market on the U.S. private-sector labor market, amid expectations of a slowdown in hiring at the start of the year after the December numbers surged to a seven-month high.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expect a gain of 156,000 in what is widely seen as the dress rehearsal for the broader government report on payrolls on Friday. The report is due at 8:15 AM ET.  
Economic data around the world were mixed: China’s service-sector purchasing managers index fell short of expectations, while the same index in the euro zone outperformed, pushing the composite PMI to a five-month high of 51.3.  The ISM’s survey of non-manufacturing activity will be released at 10 AM ET.
5. Buttigeig wins in Iowa as Washington theatricals intensify
Pete Buttigeig emerged as the winner of the Democratic Party’s Iowa caucuses, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders a close second and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren a respectable third. Former Vice-President Joe Biden trailed badly in fourth place after a lackluster campaign.
Buttigeig capitalized on the inability of Sanders and Warren to campaign more actively in the state during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which is expected to end today with his acquittal by a Republican-controlled Senate. "

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to post strong gains Wednesday, helped by reports of a breakthrough in the fight to combat China’s coronavirus outbreak. The continuing earnings season on Wall Street will also generate attention, with General Motors  looking to avoid replicating Ford s slump after the bell on Tuesday.

At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 23 points, or 0.7%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 100 up 77 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow Jones 30 futures contract rose 210 points, or 0.7%. 

Earlier Wednesday, reports emerged that a Chinese university had found a drug to treat people with the new coronavirus, while researchers in the U.K. said they had made a ""significant breakthrough"" in finding a vaccine. Neither has apparently been tested yet.

These reports have not been verified, but they add to the more positive tone started by China’s central bank trimming interest rates and injecting billions of yuan of liquidity into the markets.

The coronavirus continues to claim victims, as the mainland China death toll increased to 494, while confirmed cases rose to 24,598. But it looks like the pace of the spread is slowing, and it’s still the Hubei province, where the virus was first noticed, that has suffered the vast majority of fatalities.

Away from virus concerns, attention is set to turn to those companies reporting earnings during the day.

Walt   Disney    impressed after reporting after hours Tuesday that the number of subscribers to its new streaming service more than doubled in its first three months, to over 28 million. However, it said operating profit could take a hit of $175 million in the current quarter due to the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
On the flip side, Ford’s shares slumped more than 10% after hours after the car manufacturer posted a $1.7 billion quarterly loss and issued a lower-than-expected profit outlook for 2020. 
Rival General Motors  is due to report before the bell, with analysts expecting earnings of 1 cent a share on sales of $31.3 billion.

Staying with autos, Tesla  stock could be due a retracement Wednesday after heady gains so far this week.  It soared another 14% Tuesday, up 36% in just the past two sessions and 180% in the past three months. 
The spotlight will also be on eBay  Wednesday, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the NYSE,  has made a takeover offer for the online marketplace that could value it at more than $30 billion.

Merck reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts  forecasts but the focus is likely to be on news that the pharmaceuticals giant is set to spin off its slow-growth products into a new company.

ADP s nonfarm employment release is due at 08:15 AM ET (1315 GMT), ahead of Friday’s key official employment report. Also of note is the ISM non-manufacturing PMI number for January at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT).

In the oil markets, crude futures recovered strongly Wednesday, up from the one-year lows they hit on Tuesday, helped a little by a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute. Eyes will now turn to the release of the official inventories number at 1030 AM ET (1530 GMT)."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Thousands of passengers and crew on two cruise ships in Asian waters were placed in quarantine for China s coronavirus on Wednesday as airlines, car manufacturers and other global companies counted the cost of the fast-spreading outbreak.
China said another 65 people had died as of Tuesday, the highest daily total yet, taking the overall toll on the mainland to 490, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year.
There have been two deaths outside mainland China, both following visits to Wuhan. A man in the Philippines died last week, and a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness died in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong on Tuesday.
The virus had disrupted air travel, with more than two dozen airlines suspending or restricting flights to China and several countries, including the United States, banning the entry of anyone who has been in China over the previous two weeks.
Taiwan banned the entry of mainland residents from Thursday.
The disruption spread to cruise ships this week, with about 3,700 people facing at least two weeks locked away on a liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed that 10 people aboard had tested positive for the virus.
Passengers on the Diamond Princess posted pictures online of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks and an empty deck.
""This is not a good situation,"" British passenger David Abel said in a video shot in his cabin and posted to Facebook .
In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship docked in the city for tests after three people on board had tested positive earlier.
Hong Kong s Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, saying conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis.
 American Airlines Group   and United Airlines  said they would suspend flights to and from Hong Kong after this week, a step that would leave no U.S. carriers flying passengers to the Asian financial hub.
Nearly $700 billion was wiped off mainland Chinese stocks on Monday with many factories shut, cities cut off and travel links constricted, fuelling worries about global supply chains. Asian stocks steadied on Wednesday.
 Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) will suspend production in South Korea because of a disruption to the supply of parts, it said, becoming the first major carmaker to do so outside of China.
Global carmakers have already extended factory closures in China in line with government guidelines. These include Hyundai, Tesla , Ford , PSA  Peugeot  Citroen , Nissan (T:7201) and Honda Motor
IMPACT ON TRADE DEAL
Planemaker Airbus  has prolonged a planned closure of its final assembly plant in Tianjin, China, it said.
Taiwan s Foxconn (TW:2317), which makes phones for global vendors including Apple , aims to gradually restart factories in China next week but could take at least a week or two more to resume full production, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from a Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect this month.
Japan s central bank was ready to ramp up stimulus measures for the world s third-biggest economy, citing uncertainty over the virus.
Evidence of human-to-human spread outside China surfaced after an international business gathering in Singapore in January was linked to virus cases reported in Malaysia and South Korea, but authorities did not comment on its nature or the industry involved.
Singapore - one of the worst hit countries outside China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - has reported 24 cases of the new coronavirus.
Across mainland China, there were 3,887 new confirmed infections of the coronavirus, making a total of 24,324. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in some 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.
Macau, a gambling hub and like Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, ordered casinos to suspend operations on Tuesday, effectively halting the lifeblood of its economy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, but experts say its mortality and transmission rates are unknown. Pregnant women may be able to pass it to their unborn children, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
Asked about various media reports of ""drug breakthroughs"", WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: ""There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV.""
Russia said it would take between eight and 10 months to develop a vaccine, the Interfax news agency reported. Scores of Russians began two weeks of quarantine in Siberia on Wednesday after being flown home from Wuhan.
Beijing has criticized as an overreaction U.S. travel curbs that bar foreign nationals who have visited China.
""We have the ability and confidence to finally win this war of containment,"" China s state councillor Wang Yi told Thailand s foreign minister.
A Thai taxi-driver who recovered from the infection told reporters in Bangkok of his shock at catching it and had a message of support for Wuhan.
""If I can beat it, so can you.""

(Reuters) - Shares of  Ford Motor Co   fell nearly 8% on Wednesday, a day after the automaker forecast a lower profit for 2020, surprising analysts who also criticized the company s management for holding back details on the earnings shortfall.
The disappointing outlook underscores the higher costs that Ford has been spending on developing self-driving and electric cars to keep pace with pioneers like Tesla Inc .
The No. 2 U.S. automaker by sales volume is far behind Tesla in the development of electric car technology. A recent rally in Tesla s shares have taken its market capitalization to $160 billion, nearly four times that of Ford s valuation, despite having sales volumes that are less than 10% of Ford.
Shares of the company were down 7.6% at $8.47 in premarket trading.
Ford forecast 2020 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) between $5.6 billion and $6.6 billion, largely below at the midpoint, compared with $6.4 billion in 2019.
""It s not clear to us exactly what is driving the profit lower...The lack of transparency is not likely to sit well with investors or inspire confidence,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said, lowering target price on the stock to $9 from $10.
Ford also warned of lower profits at its credit arm and higher warranty costs, but did not provide details.
""Management declined to quantify the impact of the higher warranty, making it difficult to gauge at the moment how much or when costs should normalize lower,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, cutting price target by a $1 to $9.
""The 2020 guidance makes it hard for us to see why investors should get excited about owning Ford stock now,"" Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote in a note.
While 2021 looks promising for Ford due to its 2020 new product investment, ""investors are likely to sit out"" until the company is able to show ""sustainable"" improvement in its profit, Spak said.
Ford s adjusted EBIT has fallen for at least two consecutive years. The company s stock rose about 5% in the past 12 months, underperforming a 21% increase in the S&P 500 index (SPX)."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co  on Wednesday forecast flat profits for 2020 and reported a better-than-expected fourth quarter result as it kicked off a new effort to win over investors stampeding into shares of electric car rival Tesla Inc .
The automaker s shares were up 1.8% in early trading.
GM said it expects earnings per share for 2020 in a range from $5.75 to $6.25, excluding one time items, taxes and interest. Analysts are expecting GM to earn $6.23 this year on a comparable basis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The automaker forecast $6 billion to $7.5 billion of automotive free cash flow this year, a range that extends above the $6.5 billion GM s auto operations could have generated in 2019 excluding the costs of the 40-day United Auto Workers strike last fall.
GM expects U.S. car and light truck sales to fall by about 500,000 vehicles from last year s 17.1 million.
""Good enough,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote about GM s 2020 guidance in a note Wednesday morning.
GM appeared to be getting better treatment from Wall Street than rival Ford Motor Co s , whose shares slumped Wednesday after the company on Tuesday delivered a weaker-than-expected 2020 forecast. Ford warned of higher warranty costs, lower profits at its credit arm and continued investments in future technology such as self-driving cars.
GM s fourth quarter profits took a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day United Auto Workers strike that shut down the automaker s profitable U.S. operations. Profits from its operations in China also fell.
The company said pre-tax profits were 5 cents a share for the latest quarter excluding certain restructuring costs, down from $1.43 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast pre-tax income of a penny a share for the latest quarter.
Including restructuring costs, GM had a fourth quarter net loss of $194 million, or 16 cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter fell nearly 20% to $30.8 billion.
GM said income from its joint ventures in China fell to $200 million in the fourth quarter from $300 million a year earlier, as wholesale vehicle deliveries fell by 20%.
The Detroit company said “slower adoption of new fuel-efficient technology” by Chinese customers hit fourth quarter results from the world’s largest auto market. The company is backtracking from an effort to sell vehicles with three-cylinder engines in China, and will offer more four-cylinders.
GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said Wednesday the automaker had ""people working around the clock here to mitigate the impact"" of disruptions to production and parts supply from China s deadly coronavirus outbreak. GM will make decisions to restart idled operations in China ""plant by plant,"" Suryadevara said.
But even before the virus outbreak, GM expected the Chinese market to be volatile this year. China s auto market is maturing, Suryadevara said, which means more competitive pressure on prices and slower growth than in the past."

Investing.com -- Wall Street surged again at the opening on Wednesday, as strong U.S. economic numbers and speculative reports of progress in fighting the coronavirus combined to revive optimism.

By 10:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 269 points or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite, which opened at a record high, was up 0.4% and the S&P 500 was up 0.8%.

Sentiment was helped by a private payrolls survey by ADP which showed the U.S. private sector added more jobs in January than in any month since May 2015. The reports sets the scene for the broader labor market report from the Commerce Department on Friday.

Additionally, the Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager index rose by more than expected in January to 60.9, defying expectations of a fall to 56.5 and hitting its highest level since September.
Among individual stocks, however, the biggest mover was Tesla  stock, which gave up some of its stellar gains of the week so far as more opinion shifted to the view that it is overbought. Tesla stock fell 12.8%, but was still up 34% on the week.

Another big faller was Snap , the parent of social media network Snapchat, which fell 9.4% after reporting a wider net loss for the last quarter as a 16% annual rise in users failed to generate an equivalent amount in revenue.

Among the gainers, Zoom Video  rose 2.4% on continued speculation on a boom in remote working due to the coronavirus. It’s gained 19% this week so far.
Walt   Disney    struggled to make it over the gain line, losing 0.9% after warning that operating profit would take a hit this quarter from the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

General Motors  rose 0.6% after reporting a net loss for the quarter that was narrower than expected after a six-week strike at the end of last year, but Ford Motor   lost 7.4% after falling short of expectations and giving gloomy guidance for the year after the closing bell on Tuesday."

Shares of the electric-vehicle maker fell 9.4% to $803.63, after rising as high as $968.99 Tuesday amid what looked like an unstoppable advance. The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an “electrifying run” on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.
“Look, everybody has a pain threshold,” Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television’s Tom Keene Wednesday. “When a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.” The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.
The rapid run in Tesla shares over the past three months, which accelerated to a dizzying pace over the past week, came on the back of two strong quarterly reports, the quick construction of its China factory, an ahead-of-schedule launch of the new Model Y crossover vehicle and a first profit for the battery plant the company jointly operates in Nevada with Panasonic Corp. Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.
“Many investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,”  Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been “calm, curious and overall cautious.”
That sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping $109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock closed at $887.06, bringing its 2020 gains to 112%.
Wall Street is pedaling back on some of its enthusiasm, with Canaccord Genuity’s Jonathan Dorsheimer downgrading Tesla to hold from buy, warning of a likely “reset of expectations” in the first quarter and flagging China’s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility.
Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who added $17.6 billion to his own fortunes on the back of the rally since the beginning of the year, teased the possibility of a new factory in Texas by asking his Twitter followers to vote on the idea.
Wednesday’s turn lower does offer some comfort to short sellers, who got off to a rough start for the year, amassing $11.47 billion in mark-to-market losses, including $5.63 billion just in early February, according S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky. That compares with the $2.82 billion in mark-to-market losses that bearish investors racked up for all of 2019."

Operating profit fell 96% at General Motors  as the strike that shut down factories last fall cost it $3.6 billion.
It also got dented by a drop in income from its China operations, where vehicle deliveries slid.
It all led to a net loss for GM in the latest quarter. But its earnings per share beat Wall Street forecasts, so shares rose in early trading Wednesday morning.
GM also forecast flat profits for this year, a day after rival Ford Motor  issued a 2020 forecast that disappointed Wall Street. "

The stock soared to $900 for the first time on Tuesday; that s on the back of a 20 percent one-day surge Monday - its best one-day gain in 7 years.
The latest catalyst for the Tesla run up?
Investors are betting Tesla is way ahead of the competition when it comes to battery technology for electric vehicles.
Its partner Panasonic announced Monday that the battery venture it has with Tesla has turned profitable for the first time.
Panasonic says the demand for Tesla batteries is so brisk - it is expanding production to keep up - that s a sign Tesla may be turning the corner on the bottleneck that Elon Musk last year described as production hell.
Tesla shares have already doubled this year - and we re only a few weeks in.  Tesla now is the world s second most valuable car company behind Toyota and has a bigger market value than General Motors  and Ford combined even though it sells far fewer cars.
There are analysts out there who question that valuation since Tesla still doesn t generate the kind of cash its larger rivals do, which can be poured back into innovation.
But investors are betting big on Musk s vision of the future - which after some mis-steps is starting to show success...
It s delivering vehicles at its highest pace ever, planning to ramp up production this year and turned a profit for the second quarter in a row."

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The S&P eased from highs Wednesday, but remained in record territory, as a surge in energy stocks on easing coronavirus fears offset mostly underwhelming earnings.

The S&P 500 rose 0.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.17% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%.

Energy stocks jumped, led by a climb in oil prices on reports that OPEC and its allies are mulling deeper production cuts in response to the coronavirus s impact on Chinese demand.
  Exxon Mobil   , Halliburton  and   Noble Energy    were among some the biggest the movers.
Sentiment on stocks was also boosted by reports that researchers in the U.K. have made a ""significant breakthrough"" in finding a vaccine to the virus, strengthening hopes the outbreak will be contained sooner rather than later.

Tech, however, lagged the move higher, hit by a slump in shares of Tesla  and Snap .

Tesla reportedly plans to delay the shipment of deliveries in China due to the coronavirus casting doubt on whether the company will meet its guidance on deliveries for the full year.

But the ""aggressive trajectory of Giga 3 production and demand out of Shanghai,"" will likely keep the electric automaker on track to meet guidance, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.
The sharp selloff could also simply be an adjustment after the huge run shares have had this year and particularly since earnings.

Snap, meanwhile, plunged 13% after reporting quarterly revenue that fell short of estimating amid weaker-than-expected average revenue per user (ARPU) – a measure used to gauge the performance of social media companies.

Elsewhere on the earnings front, Ford Motor  faced a wave of selling pressure, falling 9% after missing quarterly earnings estimates. And Disney s  better-than-expected subscriber numbers for its streaming service Disney+ were offset by an expected hit in operating income due to closure of its China theme parks."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co  has watched with frustration and envy as the market value of electric carmaker Tesla Inc  has ballooned to about two and a half times GM s size, but on Wednesday the Detroit automaker made the case that its EV and self-driving technology strategy deserves a higher value.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and top executives hosted an investor conference in New York to convince potential shareholders GM is a burgeoning technology firm at the forefront of tomorrow s electric and self-driving cars. 
""We believe we re a compelling investment opportunity,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters after GM reported quarterly results, when asked about the run-up in Tesla s stock.
""From a share-price standpoint, we re very bullish on the future,"" she added.
Barra has been restructuring GM s operations and stressing her goals of readying GM for a future of ""zero emissions and zero accidents"" for several years. 
Still, GM shares trade just above the $33 share price of its 2010 initial public offering. That has left it with a market capitalization of about $49 billion, below Tesla s valuation of about $130 billion. 
""The market s got it wrong,"" said Chris Susanin, co-portfolio manager with Levin Easterly Partners, which owns shares in GM but not Tesla. ""GM should be the $150 billion market cap, not Tesla."" 
The bulk of GM s profits is still derived from the fuel-hungry pickup trucks and SUVs sold in the United States. The Chinese market has been the source of a steady $2 billion in profits a year, but that is threatened by a market slowdown, rising costs for electrification and now the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
While China will deliver lower equity income to GM in the near term, it remains a solid contributor that is profitable and dividend paying, and will play a key role in the development of EVs globally, officials said. GM also sees growth for its Cadillac brand in China.
 HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO 
Barra s challenge now is to assure investors that GM can make the leap across the gap separating its profitable internal combustion present and an uncertain electric future.
While gasoline-powered vehicles will make up a large portion of U.S. sales into the 2030s, GM has said it will spend more on developing electric vehicles than those with internal combustion engines over the next five years.
GM laid out a more detailed plan for the development of EVs and self-driving vehicles at the investor day, including its Cruise self-driving unit. 
Some analysts have suggested GM should spin off Cruise, but Suryadevara said GM has no plans to do that. She added that spending in 2020 on that business will roughly match last year s $800 million.
Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said the self-driving market opportunity totals $8 trillion. 
One of the audiences for the investor day is potential employees as GM competes with Tesla and other automakers globally to hire top engineers and software developers outside of Detroit, highlighting technical centers in Ontario and Israel.
Barra, asked whether Tesla s eventual electric pickup offering could squeeze GM s margins, said her company understands that business. ""I think we can have our cake and eat it too,"" she said.
GM also said it will offer its Supercruise partially automated driving system on 22 models by the end of 2023, GM President Mark Reuss said. 
GM also laid out its plan to reduce manufacturing complexity this year by eliminating 25% of the parts used in its plants. Barra also said GM targets sourcing all of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2040, a decade sooner than previously promised. 
In December, GM and South Korea s LG Chem (KS:051910) said they would invest $2.3 billion to build an EV battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world s largest battery facilities.
That same month, GM s Cadillac chief said most if not all of the vehicles offered by the luxury brand would be electric by 2030.

GM said last week it would invest $2.2 billion in its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to build electric trucks and SUVs. "

The electric-vehicle maker fell as much as 21% to $704.11 at 1:21 p.m. in New York, erasing most of the gains the stock saw over the past two days, amid an advance that seemed unstoppable. The stock traded just 7.7% higher than where it opened Monday morning, and 12% above Friday’s close. The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an “electrifying run” on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.
“Look, everybody has a pain threshold,” Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television’s Tom Keene Wednesday. “When a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.” The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.
The rapid run in Tesla shares over the past three months, which accelerated to a dizzying pace over the past week, came on the back of two strong quarterly reports, the quick construction of its China factory, an ahead-of-schedule launch of the new Model Y crossover vehicle and a first profit for the battery plant the company jointly operates in Nevada with Panasonic Corp. Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.
“Many investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,”  Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been “calm, curious and overall cautious.”
That sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping $109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock closed at $887.06, bringing its 2020 gains to 112%.
Wall Street is pedaling back on some of its enthusiasm, with Canaccord Genuity’s Jonathan Dorsheimer downgrading Tesla to hold from buy, warning of a likely “reset of expectations” in the first quarter and flagging China’s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility.
Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who added $17.6 billion to his own fortunes on the back of the rally since the beginning of the year, teased the possibility of a new factory in Texas by asking his Twitter followers to vote on the idea.
Wednesday’s turn lower does offer some comfort to short sellers, who got off to a rough start for the year, amassing $11.47 billion in mark-to-market losses, including $5.63 billion just in early February, according S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky. That compares with the $2.82 billion in mark-to-market losses that bearish investors racked up for all of 2019.
“At the end of it all, there’s a big sentiment shift,” said Ben Kallo, a Baird analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock. “Eighteen months ago, this was a company going out of business, everyone said. Now, it’s a business people want to invest in. Institutional growth investors are starting to look at it as a real company that can make money.”"

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla s  stock tumbled 17% on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally as a senior executive said the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars and analysts warned of its high valuation.
With Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to ""hold"" from ""buy,"" further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.
Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10.
The $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk s plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.
Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Tesla s stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies.
Even after Wednesday s drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon  at 49, Apple  at 22 and Alphabet  at 23, according to Refinitiv data.
""We ve never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,"" Gill wrote.
Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak.
The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day.
""Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,"" Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share.
The stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesday s drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.
Tesla s rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.
Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW  and Volkswagen . Even many Tesla bulls question the stock s valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.
 Barclays   analyst Brian Johnson maintained his ""underweight"" rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.
""We continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued – but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business,"" Johnson wrote in a client note.
Following Canaccord s downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla s stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv."

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The S&P closed in record territory Wednesday as investors bet that efforts to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus and support from the central banks will limit its impact on global growth.

The S&P 500 rose 1.13% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.43%, both record closes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.68%.
The coronavirus outbreak appears to be gathering pace, with the death toll nearing 500, and more than 24,000 infected. But traders appear optimistic that efforts to contain the outbreak will begin to take shape sooner rather later and any potential economic fallout will be stifled by central banks.

That eased worries about the impact on China oil demand, sparking a bid in oil prices that powered energy stocks up 3.7%, marking the sector s biggest gain since December 2018.

A slump in Tesla  and Snap , however, took some shine off the rally on Wall Street.  

Tesla fell 17% as Canaccord downgraded its rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing concerns about the impact on the production in China amid the outbreak of the coronavirus.

""Following an electrifying run in 2020, we are downgrading shares of Tesla to hold as we see a balanced risk-reward for investors to lock in profits,"" Canaccord said. ""Just as we observed a clear buy signal coming into 2020, we see the risk of China s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility, suggesting a more pragmatic position.""

Tesla reportedly plans to delay the shipment of deliveries in China due to the coronavirus, casting doubt on whether the company will meet its guidance on deliveries for the full year.
Snap, meanwhile, plunged 15% after reporting quarterly revenue that fell short of estimating amid weaker-than-expected average revenue per user (ARPU) – a measure used to gauge the performance of social media companies.

Elsewhere on the earnings front, Ford Motor  faced a wave of selling pressure, falling 9.5% after missing quarterly earnings estimates. And Disney s  better-than-expected subscriber numbers for its streaming service Disney+ were offset by an expected hit in operating income due to closure of its China theme parks. It was down 2.3%."

The Dow tacked on another 483 points Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq set record closing highs.
But given the pressure on China, the world s second largest economy, from the coronavirus outbreak, some are wondering if investors are overly confident Beijing can limit the financial impact.
Payne Capital Management s Courtney Dominguez doesn t share that concern.
SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) COURTNEY DOMINGUEZ, FINANCIAL ADVISOR, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, SAYING:
""I think, if anything, investors aren t necessarily bullish enough because of what we saw over the last year. We saw some record inflows into bonds and money markets, which means people - despite the fact that the market is doing well, we are on a record bull run - are still so nervous and putting money into safety right now and at the first sign of something to be nervous about like the coronavirus that only accelerated.""
Employment data set the positive tone for the day.  Private-sector hiring rose far more than expected in January, according to payroll company ADP .
Solid numbers from the services sector kept the jovial mood going. Business activity outside of the manufacturing industry hit a six-month high in February, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed.
But a number of individual stocks were left out of the Wall Street rally.

Investing.com - Tesla  shares tumbled 17% on Wednesday, derailing a historic rally after a senior executive said the coronavirus outbreak would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars initially scheduled for early February.
Tesla  stock down was down as much as 20% during intraday trading Wednesday, which would have been its worst day in history.
Share are off another 5% on Thursday, taking the stock below the $700-level.

The huge falls come after two spectacular days for the stock earlier this week.

Automakers Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors Co  and Ford Motor  Co have announced plans to spend billions of dollars over the next several years launching EVs in a bid to directly challenge electric carmaker Tesla  Inc, which has its own network of charging stations. Investor enthusiasm for electric vehicles has sent shares in Tesla and big battery makers soaring in recent days.
ChargePoint, which operates but does not own its charging network, and the National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO) told Reuters they formed the National Highway Charging Collaborative, with plans to install Level 2 and DC fast chargers at more than 4,000 U.S. locations by 2030 to expand EV charging along highways and in rural communities. 
The money will be raised through private operators, state and local governments, private infrastructure funds and others, ChargePoint Chief Executive Pasquale Romano said.
""Enabling long distance electric travel and equipping rural areas with vital universal charging is key and must begin scaling aggressively today,"" he said in an interview. ""This collaboration will play an important role in paving the way to the mass adoption of EVs.""
There are only a few million EVs on U.S. roads today, but in May 2019 the International Energy Agency forecast that figure could reach over 130 million by 2030.
""It appears clear that the next generation of fuel is going to be electricity, so we want to make sure that our members are prepared to meet the needs of their customers,"" NATSO CEO Lisa Mullings said in a separate interview.
ChargePoint operates more than 108,000 charging points globally, mostly in North America, and aims to increase that to 2.5 million by 2025. ChargePoint estimates it has a 70% share of the market for commercial charging in the United States.
In June 2019, ChargePoint signed a deal with VW subsidiary Electrify America to make the United States  two largest EV charging networks accessible to customers of both companies.

ChargePoint, founded in 2007, has raised $538 million from investors including Daimler, BMW and Siemens in Germany, as well as U.S. energy firms  Chevron   and America Electric Power."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese auto dealers, who have seen traffic through their showrooms slow to a trickle due to the fast-spreading coronavirus, have sought temporary financial support to see them through.
The coronavirus has killed more than 560 people in mainland China and more than 28,000 are confirmed to be infected, prompting local governments to extend holidays and introduce travel curbs to halt its spread.
In a letter publicly addressed to China s Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, China s Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) asked banks to extend loans to dealers and offer more temporary liquidity support such as credit lines to help dealers who are ""facing extreme liquidity pressure"".
The letter, which is dated Feb. 5 and posted on CADA s social media on Thursday, said auto sales and after-sales service ""show a cliff-like decline"" due to the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, travel curbs and other factors.
Industry executives said the epidemic was likely to wreak havoc on auto sales and production in the first quarter, but that it was too early to push the panic button. Last year, auto sales in China, the world s biggest auto market, dropped 8.2% year-on-year to 25.8 million vehicles.
In a separate poll conducted by CADA, dealers predicted China s car sales to fall 50-80% this month compared to February 2019. Some 70% of dealers polled by CADA said they had seen ""almost no customers"" since the end of January.
CADA, which represents thousands of dealers nationwide including China Grand Automotive Services Co (SS:600297),  China Yongda Automobiles Services  Holdings (HK:3669) and Zhongsheng Group Holdings (HK:0881), also said short-term liquidity pressure was high.
In China, cities have been shut off, flights cancelled and factories closed, shutting supply lines crucial to the world economy. Auto companies including  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), Tesla , Ford , PSA  Peugeot  Citroen , Nissan (T:7201) are taking hits.
As business in China s auto showrooms drops significantly, automakers and dealers such as Tesla,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) as well as China Grand Automotive and Yongda are promoting products heavily online."

Investing.com -- Wall Street faltered near record highs at the opening on Thursday, cautious of over-extending a vigorous rally ahead of the U.S. labor market report.

By 10:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had given up early gains to be down 43 points, or 0.2%, on the day. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%, but both were off early highs.
The market is already primed for a bullish number on nonfarm payrolls after ADP’s monthly report on private-sector hiring came in well above expectations on Wednesday. Initial jobless claims fell to their lowest since April months last week at only 202,000, further evidence of labor market tightness.

The Dow is already up 1.6% for the week so far, and up 2.6% over a month that has seen the emergence of a major threat to global growth this year. Dallas Federal Reserve head Robert Kaplan said in a speech earlier he expected U.S. growth of around 2.25% this year, a figure that he said would be higher if not for the coronavirus outbreak and Boeing s  problems with its 737 Max.

Twitter  grabbed the spotlight, rising 15% after cracking through $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, even though earnings fell in the three months to December and the company predicted continued rises in operating costs this year.
Tesla  stock retreated to the sidelines after a wild ride in the first three sessions of the week. It was down 1.5%, with buyers appearing to step in again at around the $720 level.

Becton Dickinson  stock slumped 11.8% after the medical device company said the ongoing dispute over the software controlling its infusion system Alaris would weigh on this year’s earnings.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P continued to chalk up gains Thursday, led by a sharp rise in technology stocks thanks to a surge in Twitter and improved trade sentiment as China cut tariffs on U.S. goods.

The S&P 500 rose 0.32% and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.26%.

China will halve the levies on $75 billion of U.S. imported goods as part of its efforts to comply with the phase one trade agreement, China’s Ministry of Finance said.
The move eased investor angst over China s ability to live up to its commitments under the trade deal at a time when the coronavirus threatens to puncture an already slowing economy.
Beyond trade, a parade of better-than-expected corporate earnings encouraged investors to maintain their bullish bets on stocks.

Twitter  jumped 18% after the social media company s quarterly results topped estimates and strong user additions for the quarter suggested its efforts to purge its platform of bad digital actors are taking shape.

Elsewhere in tech, Qualcomm  fell 1% after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but warned that the impact of coronavirus in China could have a ""material impact"" on its near-term profits.

  Estee Lauder    climbed 4% on the back of quarterly earnings and revenue that beat estimates, which offset a profit warning.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers on Thursday will unveil legislation that would create a nationwide electric vehicle (EV) charging network to promote the shift from gasoline-powered vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Democratic Representatives Andy Levin and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are releasing legislation dubbed the ""EV Freedom Act"" to create a network of high-speed charging stations within five years along the public roads of the national highway system in the United States at a U.S. Capitol press conference at 12 p.m. EST (1700 GMT).
Levin represents a suburban Detroit district that includes many autoworkers, while Ocasio-Cortez is from New York who helped unveil the ""Green New Deal"" earlier this year to transition the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels. They will be joined by environmental groups and the United Auto Workers union.
U.S. automakers like General Motors Co  and  Ford Motor Co   are spending billions of dollars to build a series of new electric vehicles. EV automaker Tesla Inc  is deploying its own network of fast-charging stations.
The 18-page bill reviewed by Reuters notes a lack of charging stations pose a significant barrier to higher electric vehicle sales.
""There is just no way that we will get to broad scale adoption of electric vehicles until we crush range anxiety and then it will happen precipitously,"" Levin told Reuters.
Levin said creating a new fleet of charging stations nationwide will be expensive but will create good paying jobs. He said the government could partner with companies that are currently building EV charging stations. 
Democrats running for U.S. president have pledged to spend billions of dollars on new charging stations and a House Democratic infrastructure plan released last week would also boost government funding for stations.
Many Democratic candidates have called for eliminating or largely phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030 or 2035 and back significant rebates to vehicle owners for scrapping polluting vehicles and shifting to electric vehicles. 
Senator Bernie Sanders wants to spend $85.6 billion building a national EV charging infrastructure network ""similar to the gas stations and rest stops we have today.""
Former Vice President Joe Biden says he would work to support the ""deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by 2030.""
Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg would require all new cars by 2035 be electric and would build a highway charging network with the goal of a station every 50 miles (80 km).

At the same time, Republican president Donald Trump opposed efforts in Congress last year to expand a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles and has called for eliminating it. "

But when it comes to the company’s valuation, neither truly fits.
The stock’s stunning ascent -- doubling in just the first 23 sessions of the year on record vehicle deliveries, the opening of a China plant and an earlier-than-expected profit at a jointly operated battery factory -- has cooled off as exuberance gives way to caution. But the still-meteoric advance of the last five weeks has prompted more comparisons with high-growth technology names, and even has tech-focused market watchers looking more closely at the stock’s fundamentals.
“With Tesla’s extraordinary rise from $180 last year to nearly $1,000 this past Tuesday, we are receiving an increasing volume of calls from tech PMs and analysts who have begun to pick up coverage of Tesla from the traditional industrials/autos cohort,”  Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a report, referring to portfolio managers.
The stock was volatile again Thursday, reversing early declines after two Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation to create a nationwide network of electric-vehicle charging stations. The measure is unlikely to pass in an election year with Republicans controlling the Senate.
Auto Comparisons
Tesla’s valuation, which hovered around $132 billion after Wednesday’s plunge, reflects a price-to-sales multiple around 5, compared with 0.4 for General Motors Co . and 0.2 for Ford Motor  Co. Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also trade at a multiple of less than 1. Tesla bulls, however, say it’s unfair to compare it with legacy automakers, pointing instead to technology companies as its true peers.
“It appears Tesla, in the market’s view, has gone far past the point of comparison vs traditional auto companies,” Jonas said. While Tesla’s valuation is an order of magnitude higher than autos peers, he said, “we think this is largely deserved -- Tesla is a significantly faster-growing auto company, and it is also more than an auto company.”
Yet the current share price doesn’t stand up to scrutiny when comparing Tesla with the more diversified Nasdaq 100 Index. Members of the gauge trade at an average of 6.28 times their sales and 36.5 times their earnings, which implies that Tesla would need an annual profit of $4.6 billion to justify its market value. Members of the technology-focused NYSE FANG+ Index trade at 50 times their earnings.
Tesla can’t yet be measured on a comparable price-to-earnings basis since it hasn’t had four straight profitable quarters on a GAAP basis. It was in the black in the past two periods on an adjusted basis.
“Tesla could be at $900, but it would need revenues like Volkswagen, margins like Apple , and reinvest like no other manufacturing company in history has ever done,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business who specializes in valuation. It’s possible Tesla succeeds in doing one of those things, but “connect them together and that’s when the story implodes. This is a Grimm fairy tale with manic swings.”
Little Sense
Tesla reported an annual loss on a GAAP basis of about $862 million for 2019. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect it to reach $4.9 billion in net income in 2023.
“Tesla is trading at well over two times the enterprise value of Daimler, and three times of BMW,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin, said in an interview. “That doesn’t seem to make so much sense to me.”
The debate comes down to whether Tesla has a years- or some day even a decade-long lead over other automakers in the electric-car race. It “seems the market has decided it’s a much longer lead than a one or two years,” Irwin said.
“Not to sound like an ‘OK, boomer’ to the younger investors rushing into Tesla shares, but the recent price action brings to mind Nasdaq circa 1999,”  Barclays   auto analyst Brian Johnson said. The recent price surge opened up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, reducing any chance of a stalled business, yet Tesla remains fundamentally overvalued, he said.
Tesla’s volatile swings over the past few days called to mind a similar performance from Qualcomm  Inc. almost exactly 20 years ago, when the stock soared 360% over five months. After touching a high of $100 in early January 2000, the stock started paring the gains. Only now, roughly two decades later, has it re-approached those levels. Qualcomm traded around $88 Thursday after issuing a disappointing forecast for second-quarter chip shipments."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When worries over the coronavirus shook U.S. stocks out of a period of quiet trading last week, investors wondered if the outbreak was the “Black Swan” event that would trigger a sharp decline. Less than a week later, talk has turned instead to a market melt-up.
After that brief swoon, the market made a roaring recovery, and there were also rallies in Tesla  Inc, bitcoin and other assets often seen as barometers for risk appetite.
The sharp snapback has revived concerns among some investors that market participants are growing overly confident that easy money policies from central banks will underpin prices, despite serious risks to global growth from the coronavirus. 
""There could be more downside if the (outbreak) spreads, but for now the trend is still up. The bigger risk is arguably that we end up in a mini-bubble,"" said Troy Gayeski - Co-CIO of SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm.
Gayeski said that coming into the year SkyBridge had positioned its portfolio to take advantage of gains by using equity call options.
“We did put some equity call exposure in the portfolio coming into the year, because if one of the risks is a bubble developing then why not try to participate?""
The S&P 500 stands near a record high after rallying nearly 4% from its lows of last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite have also hit highs while the CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, has drifted lower after spiking last week to its highest in nearly four months. 
Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at brokerage firm JonesTrading, noted markets have shot higher despite uncertainty over how long travel restrictions and shutdowns will weigh on large portions of China’s economy. Easy monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve has made investors bolder about taking risks, he said. 
“Every time there’s been a downturn in the market, the Fed has stepped in to ease,” he said. “Investors have been trained in a Pavlovian manner to not assess risk and buy every dip you get.”
The World Health Organization said Wednesday was the first day the overall number of new coronavirus cases in China dropped, although the outbreak continues to rage in Hubei province. 
It’s still unclear, however, how long the shutdowns that have paralyzed Hubei and other areas will remain in place, or the effects they will have on growth in China and abroad. 
“My client conversations are all about, ‘is this the black swan? Is this what can derail the global expansion?” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities. A “black swan” event refers to an unforeseen occurrence that typically has extreme consequences.
Right now, “we don’t think this is a Black Swan.”
Investors will worry if China extends shutdowns or expands them to other areas, said Jens Nordvig, founder of analytics firm Exante Data. 
“Most people expect things will normalize by next week,” he said. “If there was an announcement of another extension...that will freak people out.”
Trying to time the market’s declines and betting against more gains has been a losing strategy over the more than decade-long bull run in stocks, despite repeated worries about rich valuations and overexuberance. 
Still, some investors are taking a cautious view of the recent advance. George Schultze, founder of Schultze Asset Management in New York, said now may be a good time to lock in gains on the rally."

U.S. hiring picked up in January much faster than expected. 225,000 new jobs were created last month, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department.
Unseasonably mild temperatures gave hiring in weather-sensitive sectors like construction a boost.
A tightening labor market is starting to consistently matter where it counts: wallets. Average paychecks saw a 3.1 percent jump over the past 12 months. That pay raise is likely to be enough to ensure the mighty U.S. consumer keeps on spending.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate moved up to 3.6 percent as more Americans returned to the workforce and started looking for work.
Despite January s solid hiring data there are some cracks showing.
Revisions by the Labor Department showed the economy created half a million fewer jobs than previously announced for the period of April 2018 to March 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pretty much everyone on Wall Street has an opinion about Tesla .
The electric vehicle maker s stupendous rally in recent months has given shareholders something to cheer about, cost short sellers billions of dollars and vindicated legions of retail investors who have long adored Elon Musk s company. 
Tesla shares have soared by nearly 320% since early June, helped by the company s better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.
After surging 36% over Monday and Tuesday, the stock by Friday had settled back to a gain of about 15% for the week. On Friday afternoon, it was down marginally at $747.11. 
Another factor driving this week s surge may be fund managers hurrying to raise their allocation of the stock, analysts said.
""A lot of advisors and institutions, they jump in the bandwagon because they don t want to trail,"" said vocal Tesla bull Ross Gerber, president and chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki in Santa Monica, California. ""If Tesla goes to $1,000 and they don t own it, what are they going to tell their clients?""
Gerber trimmed his fund s position in the stock as the company s valuation soared. He hopes to buy more if the stock falls and said a fair valuation would be around $550.
THE BULLS 
Retail investors have driven part of the surge. 
Among Fidelity Investments customers, Tesla has been by far the most actively traded stock in recent sessions, with nearly 16,000 buy orders for the electric carmaker s shares. Twitter, ranked second overall in trading activity on Fidelity, had just over 2,000 buy orders.
On Monday, when Tesla shot up 20% in its biggest one day rally since 2013, clients at TD Ameritrade - millennials in particular - overwhelmingly took profits after having bought the stock for months, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at the online brokerage. 
Tesla s biggest institutional shareholders are Baillie Gifford, Capital World and Vanguard, according to Refinitiv data.
It also has an international following. Retail investors in South Korea have been trading Tesla shares at a furious pace in recent weeks, buying and selling $200 million worth of stock in January, according to the Korea Securities Depository. Volume in November stood at $43 million.
Tesla options positioning is also bullish. According to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert, skew turned deeply negative this week, meaning that demand for calls, used to position for further share gains, has surpassed demand for puts, used to guard against a fall in shares. 
That s a departure from the usual dynamic in most stocks, in which options used for downside protection generally command prices higher than those for upside participation.

Tesla s biggest winner is Musk, who stands to earn more than $1 billion thanks to Tesla s recent rally. The company s market capitalization briefly exceeded $150 billion this week, the second target in his record-breaking compensation package that opens the way to options awarded to him vesting.

THE BEARS 
Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla ""sell"" than ""buy,"" and the company s stock is the most shorted on Wall Street, with nearly $18 billion sold short. 
Those bearish investors plan to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price. Yet while short investors in Tesla have suffered paper losses of over $11 billion so far in 2020, they have mostly held their ground, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. 
One seller in the December quarter was Saudi Arabia s public investment fund, according to a filing on Tuesday.
Some funds that reportedly hold short positions are London-based Crispin Odey, according to the Financial Times. Odey was not immediately available for comment.
The Financial Times also reported that Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, had told investors last month it held a put option against Tesla, which would be a bet against the stock. A spokesman for Greenlight declined to comment.

In a report released Friday ahead of Fed chairman Jerome Powell s twice-a-year update to Congress next week, the Fed said the recent emergence of the coronavirus could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.
Major U.S. airlines have halted flights to China, consumer brands including  Nike   have warned the coronavirus is taking its toll as stores remain shut, and manufacturing supply chains for the likes of Tesla  and Apple  have been disrupted with workers forced to stay home.
Even with the potential fallout, the Fed says the likelihood of a U.S. recession occurring over the next year has dramatically reduced in recent months.
It noted a manufacturing slump caused by an unwillingness for businesses to spend during numerous trade spats between the U.S. and trading partners - wasn t enough to drag the economy into a recession.
And pointed to continued strength in the U.S. job market and consumer spending.
The U.S. economy is in the midst of a record-long economic expansion that began after the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
The Fed cut rates three times last year amid fears the U.S.-China trade war threatened to slam the brakes on that recovery but has since declared it is no rush to move rates up or down."

1/COUNTING THE ECONOMIC TOLL
The coronavirus continues to claim lives, yet the impact on global demand and companies is just starting to be felt. Recent days have seen an unremitting flow of dire headlines as supply chains from New Zealand to the United States felt the impact of a paralyzed China. 
Toyota and Honda are suspending production in China, Hyundai has halted work in South Korea, airlines are grounding flights and reducing staff, and central banks are easing policy.
China s 2020 growth estimates have been slashed as much as a percentage point from the 6% initially expected. Some factories could reopen in the coming days, while others are expected to stay shut for now. 
Some financial markets were quick to recover: Wall Street climbed to records, encouraged by earnings and economic data. Chinese stocks, which lost $700 billion of market value on reopening after Lunar New Year holidays, have now clawed back half those losses. Yet commodity prices such as copper and oil, seen by many as a better signal for the real economy, still have some way to recover.
Investors waiting to get a readout of the economic toll may have to be a bit more patient. Inflation and monetary indicators in China are scheduled for release over the coming days, the latter expected to show some effects of the central bank s efforts to support suffering firms. 
But retail sales and industrial activity will only be published in March, while trade data due out for release on Feb. 7 has been postponed.

2/""DON T FEAR THE REPO"" 
That, in all likelihood, will be one of the main messages Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell seeks to deliver to U.S. lawmakers in two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. Given Powell and his Fed crew have been consistent in recent messaging that there is no hurry to resume rate cuts (or hikes) and that they see the economy in ""a good place"" one topic that might generate fireworks in his appearances on Tuesday and Wednesday is ""repo"". 
A band of Democrats from the Senate Banking Committee, where Powell heads on Wednesday, has already sent him a list of questions about last autumn s upheaval in the repurchase agreement market, where banks go to secure funding to meet their reserve requirements. The episode – when a cash squeeze drove overnight repo interest rates to 10% - forced the Fed back into the active bond-buying business for the first time in some five years and it scooped up more than $300 billion of T-bills since. 
The Fed has also become the lender of first resort in the repo market, pumping tens of billions of dollars each day into money markets to ensure liquidity and avoid another squeeze. 
Policy-makers believe the repo riot was triggered by having allowed bank reserve levels to fall too low in the roughly two years it had been letting the stash of bonds on its balance sheet dwindle. Reserves are on the upswing again, but just where the sweet spot in reserve levels lies is the big unknown, and Powell will be pressed for answers.

3/EUROPE S TURNING POINT
European stock markets have already put in a stellar performance in 2020 with many indexes hitting record highs in recent days. With the results season underway, Stoxx 600 companies are seen reporting 1.2% earnings growth in the fourth quarter, according to IBES Refinitiv, marking the end of a nine-month corporate recession in Europe. 
Now it is time to see if GDP readings due out provide any hints of those ""green shoots"" detected in the recent European PMI readings, which spurred hopes that a long slump in the region s manufacturing sector could also be bottoming out. 
In Britain, recent PMI readings showed a post-election economy bounce in January as services companies enjoyed the strongest influx of new orders since mid-2018. December GDP data, due on Tuesday, is expected to come in at 0.8% in Q4 year-on-year after 1.1% in Q3. 
On the continent, flash data out on Friday is expected to show that year-on-year GDP growth across the bloc remained at 1.0% in the fourth quarter, while expansion in Germany is predicted to cool to 0.4% year-in-year from 0.5% in Q3. 
Though with potential supply chain disruptions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, there could be some new headaches waiting just around the corner.

HAPPY VALENTINE S DAY FILINGS, TESLA WATCHERS! 
The end of the week will see a flurry of filings from investment firms as the deadline for 13F forms for the quarterly period ending Dec. 31 falls on Feb. 14. Investment firms that hold more than $100 million in securities are required to file and disclose their holdings in equity securities and other products, according to the SEC website. 
One of the hot stocks to watch out for is electric vehicle maker Tesla , which has seen a spectacular rally of nearly 80% this year. Tesla has been revving up markets as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk s vision, and on the future for electric vehicles.
So who s on and who s off the big Tesla rollercoaster? Up to now, the biggest institutional shareholders are Baillie Gifford, Capital World and Vanguard, while its top three hedge fund investors are Renaissance Technologies, Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co and Citadel, according to Refinitiv data. One seller in the quarter was Saudi Arabia s public investment fund, according to a recent filing.

5/CENTRAL BANKING IN THE TIME OF CORONA
A clutch of central banks are set to meet in days to come as the death toll from the deadly virus outbreak has crossed the 600 mark while analysts are still counting the costs to the global economy.
While major global central banks including the Fed and the Reserve Bank of Australia have warned of a significant hit from the virus to economic output in recent days, they have stopped short of loosening monetary policy outright.
But not so their emerging market counterparts. Both Philippines and Thailand cut interest rates unexpectedly this week while Singapore, which controls policy via its currency, said its local dollar has more room to weaken.
Emerging market central banks have more reason to fear the impact of the dreaded virus. China now accounts for a third of global growth compared to only 10% during the SARS epidemic, and the economies with the strongest trade ties with Beijing are feeling the heat.
With multiple channels of exposure including trade, tourism and services, central banks from Sweden to Indonesia will have plenty of food for thought when policy-makers meet in the coming weeks.

SHENZHEN, China/BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese economy will sputter towards normal on Monday after the coronavirus outbreak forced an extended holiday, although numerous stores and factories will remain shut and many white collar employees will continue working from home.
The usually week-long Lunar New Year holiday was extended by 10 days in much of China amid mounting alarm over an epidemic that as of Saturday morning had killed 722 people.
Huge cities including Beijing and Shanghai seem like ghost towns, with shops and restaurants closed or empty, and as containment measures including transportation curbs are enforced in many parts of the country. Some cities are keeping schools closed and restrictions on movements remain.
Many employers in the southern technology hub of Shenzhen are taking precautions to prevent workers from returning in large crowds, asking those who have traveled from elsewhere to self-quarantine for up to 14 days.
Calls to the hotlines of an NGO serving migrant workers in nearby city of Guangzhou have multiplied in recent days.
""People are asking,  what if my factory hasn t put enough safety measures in place? Will there be a notice suspending work again? How do I get in to work if roads are sealed off? "" said Ice Huang, a spokeswoman for the Inno Community Development Organization.
Apple Inc  said on Friday its retail stores in China would stay closed, even as it worked toward opening its corporate offices and contact centers.
Apple supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) plans only to ""gradually"" restart its factories with a view to resuming full production in late February, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
While in Shanghai, the city government said Tesla s  factory would reopen on Monday.
The toll on China s already-slowing economy has been heavy, with Goldman Sachs  cutting its first quarter GDP target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying an even deeper hit is possible.
""It s certainly not going to be a return to normal next week,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. ""The longer this disruption continues the higher the risk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger hit on the economy,"" he said.
TEMPERATURE CHECKS, HOME QUARANTINE
In Shenzhen, businesses looking to reopen were required to check the recent travel history of all staff and implement temperature checks and prevention measures such as providing masks. Similar guidelines were in place elsewhere.
Some businesses told Reuters that they were not sure when they would reopen.
""We re still not sure we ll be open on Monday,"" Suki, who works in human resources for a Belgian-owned manufacturing company in Shenzhen and declined to give her surname.
""We applied online to open five days ago but inspectors only visited today,"" she said on Friday.
Still, Sunday is set to be the peak travel day of the Lunar New Year period, an official from the Transport Ministry said this week, as millions of Chinese return from their holidays."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla s  factory in China s financial hub of Shanghai will resume production on Feb. 10 with assistance to help it cope with a spreading epidemic of coronavirus, a Shanghai government official said on Saturday. 
Many factories across China shut in late January for the Lunar New Year holiday that was originally due to end on Jan. 30 but which was extended in a bid to contain the spread of the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 700 people.
Tesla warned on Jan. 30 that it would see a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp-up of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars as a result of the epidemic, which has severely disrupted communications and supply chains across China.
Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said this week that production would restart on Feb. 10 and that car deliveries from the plant would be temporarily delayed.
""In view of the practical difficulties key manufacturing firms including Tesla have faced in resuming production, we will coordinate to make all efforts to help companies resume production as soon as possible,"" Shanghai municipal government spokesman Xu Wei said. 
The $2 billion Shanghai factory is Tesla s first outside the United States and was built with support from local authorities. It started production in October and began deliveries last month.
The Shanghai government also said on Saturday it would ask banks to extend loans with preferential rates to small companies and exempt firms in hard-hit sectors like hospitality from value-added tax, among other measures to prop up businesses during the epidemic. 

Such assistance would also apply to foreign companies. "

The German government has earmarked financial support for making electric car battery cells locally as a way to secure manufacturing jobs as tougher emissions rules threaten demand for older technologies, like diesel engines.
Altmaier said in order to qualify for state subsidies companies needed to fulfill certain requirements in the areas of sustainability and battery efficiency.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian currencies lifted a little on Monday amid some early signs that the spread of the coronavirus epidemic could be slowing down and as some big businesses resumed work in China after the Lunar New Year holiday.
Workers began trickling back to offices and factories around the country as the government eased some restrictions on travel in the wake of the epidemic that has now killed more than 900 people, mostly on the mainland.
The Australian dollar  rose 0.5% to as high as $0.6706, pulling away from a decade-low touched earlier in the session. It has lost 4.5% this year.
The New Zealand dollar  bounced 0.1% from a two-month low to $0.6405. The safe-haven yen  softened slightly to 109.75 yen per dollar, while bonds dipped and stock markets pared early losses with the broad appetite for risk.
""We ve seen positive headlines about a few large companies all reporting that they were going to be resuming and reopening facilities in China,"" said Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac in Sydney.
Taiwan s Foxconn (TW:2317), a major contractor in global technology production, received approval to resume production at a plant in China s north, one person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Carmaker Tesla s  Shanghai factory was due resume production on Monday, a government official said last week, adding that authorities will provide assistance to the firm.
In further news over the weekend, the official daily update on the number of new infections in China reported fewer than 3,000 new cases for the first time since Feb. 2.
That was tempered a little on Monday when the latest daily number of reported new cases again topped that benchmark at 3,062, but Franulovich said that markets were for now focused on the positive.
The Chinese yuan  rose 0.2% to 6.9891 and pulled beaten-up Asian currencies with it. [CNY/]
The Korean won , Thai baht  and Singapore dollar , which have all been heavily sold on virus fears, traded firmer by mid-session.
Though plenty of caution remained, as the return to work was subdued elsewhere and the scale supply-chain disruption only beginning to become clear.
Kia Motors (KS:000270) will suspend production at its three car plants in South Korea due to a shortage of parts, a company official said on Monday.
A large number of workplaces remain closed and many white-collar workers continue to work from home. On one of the usually busiest subway lines in Beijing, trains were largely empty.
""We re seeing some buying of AUD today, in line with some confidence coming back as the market rolls into latter Asia trade, but rallies are to be sold in my opinion,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
Any hints of weakness in the local labor market, or a change of heart globally, could ramp up the chances of a rate cut by May, currently rated at about 40%, Weston said."
166,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/nightmare-for-global-tech-coronavirus-fallout-just-beginning-2080235,2020-02-10,‘Nightmare’ for Global Tech: Coronavirus Fallout Just Beginning By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- As Chinese-based manufacturers begin to restart factories Monday, no one knows for sure when they’ll be back at full-speed -- or what sort of chaos may ensue.
Tech producers led by Foxconn, which makes the majority of the world’s iPhones from Zhengzhou a few hundred miles from the coronavirus outbreak’s epicenter, had begun preparing investors for the potential bedlam when hundreds of thousands make their way back to factories. Apple Inc .’s most important partner warned investors of the daunting task of securing enough workers despite widespread transport blockades, quarantining thousands, and the “nightmare” scenario of an on-campus epidemic that could shut down production altogether. Last week, it took the unprecedented step of warning workers to stay away from its Shenzhen headquarters till further notice as government inspectors vet its containment procedures, Bloomberg News reported.
“How we can make sure there will be no infection within our campuses will be the first priority, because if you put a lot of people together and one of them gets infected, that will be a nightmare,” Foxconn investor relations chief Alex Yang told investors on a Thursday call, according to a recording obtained by Bloomberg News. “We try very hard to make sure the possibility of any on-site infection will be as low as zero, although it will be challenging.”

The deadly virus has illustrated the increasingly central role China plays in global manufacturing, from clothing and chemicals to automobiles and especially technology. Just about every major piece of consumer electronics is made in China, from iPhones and gaming consoles to half the world’s liquid crystal display or LCD screens. The contagion has already shuttered plants across China for a week longer than anticipated after the Lunar New Year break -- a disruption that could get much worse if rolling quarantines and suspended rail and air links prevent the return of the millions of blue-collar laborers at the heart of electronics assembly.
When they do make it back, untold numbers will get funneled into a quarantine of up to two weeks -- a sequester of unknown scale. Any disruptions at Chinese plants can, in a worst-case scenario, freeze parts of the supply chain by triggering cascading shortages. Influential supply chain analyst Kuo Ming-chi of TF International estimates Foxconn’s main iPhone-making base will properly resume work only next week -- and then at 40% to 60% capacity.  Citigroup   estimates just 30% of the entire Chinese semiconductor workforce is estimated to return to their workplaces as of Feb 11.
Foxconn said in a statement Saturday it’s working with local governments to prepare for the return of employees, without specifics. Shenzhen’s Longhua district said in a WeChat post it was helping the Taiwanese company fine-tune its plans. “To safeguard everyone’s health and safety and comply with government virus prevention measures, we urge you not to return to Shenzhen,” Foxconn wrote in a Feb. 5 text message to employees based in the southern city. “As for the happy reunion date in Shenzhen, please wait for further notice.”
On last week’s call, Yang spoke in depth about Foxconn’s virus-prevention measures and the need to comply with various regulations in the so-called “iPhone city” of Zhengzhou -- just 300 miles from Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak -- covering infection-fighting measures from quarantines to face mask and hand sanitizer inventories. “If you are talking about tens of thousands of people in a line, in a building, in a campus and we try to prevent a virus -- and in the meantime you are asking for them to do their normal job -- that’s very challenging.”
Apple and Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., were among the first corporations to try and quantify the viral epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China, as well as dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, the Taiwanese company has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak could disrupt Chinese manufacturing and hence the world’s supply of electronics.
The disruptions extend well beyond electronics or technology. Many auto plants in the world’s largest market remain idled. Toyota Motor Corp., which initially halted its Chinese plants until Feb. 9, said Friday it now plans to resume production as soon as Feb. 17. Honda Motor Co. said it will reopen its factory in Hubei on Feb. 14 with an eye toward restarting output the week of Feb. 17. And Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also delayed the resumption of production at some of its Chinese businesses until Feb. 17.
Expect the “supply chain situation to get worse before getting better,” wrote Jeff Pu of GF Securities.
One thing in the industry’s favor is that the first half of the year is often a lull period for a consumer electronics sphere driven by holiday  sales and new iPhones in the fall. Yang stressed that the disruption was “manageable” and that Hon Hai would scramble to make up for any early 2020 production shortfall.
Several of the biggest names in tech including Sony Corp (T:6758). and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. have said they’ll restart production in China as scheduled. Production at Tesla  Inc.’s new Shanghai factory -- its first outside the U.S. -- resumed production on Feb. 10., it said.
But much depends on the extent and severity of the outbreak. Even if it peaks soon, the interconnectedness of just-in-time global supply means the entire system will go through an unprecedented upheaval. The shortage of just one component exerts a ripple effect on the entire chain by holding up production further down the line, rippling through the carefully choreographed networks that companies from Apple to Huawei Technologies Co. and display-maker BOE Technology Group Co. rely on.
“There will certainly be risks of on-site infections. Companies also do not have control over neighborhoods near their factories,” said Eric Tseng, chief executive officer of Taipei-based Isaiah Research. “Manpower levels for most manufacturers will still be low during the first two to three weeks of February due to the length of quarantines and the possibility that not many workers will return.”
If Supply Chain Must Face a Pandemic, Now’s the Time: Tim Culpan
Unlike in previous years, Foxconn hasn’t even begun the recruitment of the hundreds of thousands it employs annually to piece together gadgets like the  Sony Corp.  PlayStation and HP Inc . computers, according to people familiar with the matter. Local executives were awaiting clarity and trying to reconcile rapid-fire and sometimes conflicting virus-prevention measures announced by local governments.
As such, its main iPhone-making plant in Zhengzhou may start the week of Feb. 10 with just a small number of workers who didn’t decamp for their hometowns before the extended break, one of the people said. The majority of the plant’s workforce are expected to encounter immense travel obstacles, the person added, asking not to be identified talking about internal matters. Foxconn’s two biggest campuses in Shenzhen now also face a similar predicament given the warning to employees to stay away.
To make matters worse, the virus has shrunk the available labor pool. Foxconn will temporarily halt recruiting workers from Hubei, site of the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan, and other heavily affected areas in neighboring provinces, a second person said. It’s ordered workers currently in Hubei as well as from seven other cities in adjacent Henan, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces not to return to work, according to an internal document dated Feb. 4. obtained by Bloomberg. The company offered a 200 yuan ($28) reward to employees who report on co-workers violating that ban. While the picture remains murky, Foxconn is the most visible proxy for the confusion that now grips the broader supply chain.
More broadly, economists are still struggling to tote up the economic fallout of the outbreak. While SARS was bad economic news for China and its neighbors, which suffered from weaker exports and falling tourism, China’s small weight capped the global impact back then, when China’s GDP was 4% of the global total. That share now stands at 17%. That means, even if the outbreak peaks soon and producers impose double overtime to make up for lost production, the final end-demand in 2020 for gadgets of all stripes could take a severe beating.
At Huawei, China’s largest tech company and a global leader in smartphones and networking gear, executives are debating when to resume production for fear of angering Beijing by forcing large numbers of people into cramped dorms and factories, according to another person familiar with the matter. Then there’s the LCD makers from BOE to Tianma Microelectronics Co. that now crank out 50% or more of the screens for all TVs, phones and even car dashboards -- much of that from Wuhan.
The city is an important base for FiberHome and other optical fiber makers as well, that Huawei and networking firms rely on. “These will get directly hit,” said Kevin Chen, an analyst at China Merchants Securities. “ Near-term, their production will be impacted even if they resume working they might have a problem getting enough workers resulting in lower utilization.”"

Tech producers led by Foxconn (TW:2354), which makes the majority of the world’s iPhones from Zhengzhou a few hundred miles from the coronavirus outbreak’s epicenter, had begun preparing investors for the potential bedlam when hundreds of thousands make their way back to factories.

Apple Inc s  most important partner warned investors of the daunting task of securing enough workers despite widespread transport blockades, quarantining thousands, and the “nightmare” scenario of an on-campus epidemic that could shut down production altogether. Last week, it took the unprecedented step of warning workers to stay away from its Shenzhen headquarters till further notice as government inspectors vet its containment procedures, Bloomberg News reported.
“How we can make sure there will be no infection within our campuses will be the first priority, because if you put a lot of people together and one of them gets infected, that will be a nightmare,” Foxconn investor relations chief Alex Yang told investors on a Thursday call, according to a recording obtained by Bloomberg News. “We try very hard to make sure the possibility of any on-site infection will be as low as zero, although it will be challenging.”
The deadly virus has illustrated the increasingly central role China plays in global manufacturing, from clothing and chemicals to automobiles and especially technology. Just about every major piece of consumer electronics is made in China, from iPhones and gaming consoles to half the world’s liquid crystal display or LCD screens. The contagion has already shuttered plants across China for a week longer than anticipated after the Lunar New Year break -- a disruption that could get much worse if rolling quarantines and suspended rail and air links prevent the return of the millions of blue-collar laborers at the heart of electronics assembly.
When they do make it back, untold numbers will get funneled into a quarantine of up to two weeks -- a sequester of unknown scale. Any disruptions at Chinese plants can, in a worst-case scenario, freeze parts of the supply chain by triggering cascading shortages. Influential supply chain analyst Kuo Ming-chi of TF International estimates Foxconn’s main iPhone-making base will properly resume work only next week -- and then at 40% to 60% capacity.  Citigroup   estimates just 30% of the entire Chinese semiconductor workforce is estimated to return to their workplaces as of Feb 11.
Foxconn said in a statement Saturday it’s working with local governments to prepare for the return of employees, without specifics. Shenzhen’s Longhua district said in a WeChat post it was helping the Taiwanese company fine-tune its plans. “To safeguard everyone’s health and safety and comply with government virus prevention measures, we urge you not to return to Shenzhen,” Foxconn wrote in a Feb. 5 text message to employees based in the southern city. “As for the happy reunion date in Shenzhen, please wait for further notice.”
On last week’s call, Yang spoke in depth about Foxconn’s virus-prevention measures and the need to comply with various regulations in the so-called “iPhone city” of Zhengzhou -- just 300 miles from Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak -- covering infection-fighting measures from quarantines to face mask and hand sanitizer inventories. “If you are talking about tens of thousands of people in a line, in a building, in a campus and we try to prevent a virus -- and in the meantime you are asking for them to do their normal job -- that’s very challenging.”
Apple and Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., were among the first corporations to try and quantify the viral epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China, as well as dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, the Taiwanese company has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak could disrupt Chinese manufacturing and hence the world’s supply of electronics.
The disruptions extend well beyond electronics or technology. Many auto plants in the world’s largest market remain idled. Toyota Motor Corp., which initially halted its Chinese plants until Feb. 9, said Friday it now plans to resume production as soon as Feb. 17. Honda Motor Co. said it will reopen its factory in Hubei on Feb. 14 with an eye toward restarting output the week of Feb. 17. And Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also delayed the resumption of production at some of its Chinese businesses until Feb. 17.
Expect the “supply chain situation to get worse before getting better,” wrote Jeff Pu of GF Securities.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
Hon Hai, ZTE (HK:0763) and Quanta may not recover as quickly as electronics makers did after the SARS outbreak. China’s growth may slow further and 5G phone sales could disappoint as they don’t seem to have the features that drive widespread consumer upgrades.
- Charles Shum, BI technology analyst
One thing in the industry’s favor is that the first half of the year is often a lull period for a consumer electronics sphere driven by holiday sales and new iPhones in the fall. Yang stressed that the disruption was “manageable” and that Hon Hai would scramble to make up for any early 2020 production shortfall.

Several of the biggest names in tech including   Sony Corp.   (T:6758) and   Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   (KS:005930) have said they’ll restart production in China as scheduled. Production at Tesla  Inc.’s new Shanghai factory -- its first outside the U.S. -- resumed on Feb. 10., it said. And Apple-assembler   Pegatron   Corp (TW:4938) on Monday said it’s gradually restarting operations.
But much depends on the extent and severity of the outbreak. Even if it peaks soon, the interconnectedness of just-in-time global supply means the entire system will go through an unprecedented upheaval. The shortage of just one component exerts a ripple effect on the entire chain by holding up production further down the line, rippling through the carefully choreographed networks that companies from Apple to Huawei Technologies Co. and display-maker BOE Technology Group Co. rely on.

1/COUNTING THE ECONOMIC TOLL
The coronavirus continues to claim lives, yet the impact on global demand and companies is just starting to be felt. Recent days have seen an unremitting flow of dire headlines as supply chains from New Zealand to the United States felt the impact of a paralyzed China.
Toyota and Honda are suspending production in China, Hyundai has halted work in South Korea, airlines are grounding flights and reducing staff, and central banks are easing policy.
China s 2020 growth estimates have been slashed as much as a percentage point from the 6% initially expected. Workers began trickling back to offices and factories on Monday around China after an extended Lunar New Year holiday.
Some financial markets were quick to recover: Wall Street climbed to records, encouraged by earnings and economic data. Chinese stocks, which lost $700 billion of market value on reopening after Lunar New Year holidays, had clawed back half those losses by last week. Yet commodity prices such as copper and oil, seen by many as a better signal for the real economy, still have some way to recover.
Investors waiting to get a readout of the economic toll may have to be a bit more patient. Monetary indicators in China scheduled for release over coming days are expected to show some effects of the central bank s efforts to support suffering firms. Data on inflation at the factory-gate out on Monday snapped their six months deflation spell, while the consumer price index rose more than forecast, by 5.4%.
But retail sales and industrial activity will only be published in March, while trade data due out for release on Feb. 7 has been postponed.

2/""DON T FEAR THE REPO""
That, in all likelihood, will be one of the main messages Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell seeks to deliver to U.S. lawmakers in two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. Given Powell and his Fed crew have been consistent in recent messaging that there is no hurry to resume rate cuts (or hikes) and that they see the economy in ""a good place"" one topic that might generate fireworks in his appearances on Tuesday and Wednesday is ""repo"".
A band of Democrats from the Senate Banking Committee, where Powell heads on Wednesday, has already sent him a list of questions about last autumn s upheaval in the repurchase agreement market, where banks go to secure funding to meet their reserve requirements. The episode – when a cash squeeze drove overnight repo interest rates to 10% - forced the Fed back into the active bond-buying business for the first time in some five years and it scooped up more than $300 billion of T-bills since.
The Fed has also become the lender of first resort in the repo market, pumping tens of billions of dollars each day into money markets to ensure liquidity and avoid another squeeze.
Policy-makers believe the repo riot was triggered by having allowed bank reserve levels to fall too low in the roughly two years it had been letting the stash of bonds on its balance sheet dwindle. Reserves are on the upswing again, but just where the sweet spot in reserve levels lies is the big unknown, and Powell will be pressed for answers.

3/EUROPE S TURNING POINT
European stock markets have already put in a stellar performance in 2020 with many indexes hitting record highs in recent days. With the results season underway, Stoxx 600 companies are seen reporting 1.2% earnings growth in the fourth quarter, according to IBES Refinitiv, marking the end of a nine-month corporate recession in Europe.
Now it is time to see if GDP readings due out provide any hints of those ""green shoots"" detected in the recent European PMI readings, which spurred hopes that a long slump in the region s manufacturing sector could also be bottoming out.
In Britain, recent PMI readings showed a post-election economy bounce in January as services companies enjoyed the strongest influx of new orders since mid-2018. December GDP data, due on Tuesday, is expected to come in at 0.8% in Q4 year-on-year after 1.1% in Q3.
On the continent, flash data out on Friday is expected to show that year-on-year GDP growth across the bloc remained at 1.0% in the fourth quarter, while expansion in Germany is predicted to cool to 0.4% year-in-year from 0.5% in Q3.
Though with potential supply chain disruptions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, there could be some new headaches waiting just around the corner.

HAPPY VALENTINE S DAY FILINGS, TESLA WATCHERS!
    The end of the week will see a flurry of filings from investment firms as the deadline for 13F forms for the quarterly period ending Dec. 31 falls on Feb. 14. Investment firms that hold more than $100 million in securities are required to file and disclose their holdings in equity securities and other products, according to the SEC website.
    One of the hot stocks to watch out for is electric vehicle maker Tesla , which has seen a spectacular rally of nearly 80% this year. Tesla has been revving up markets as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk s vision, and on the future for electric vehicles.
    So who s on and who s off the big Tesla rollercoaster? Up to now, the biggest institutional shareholders are Baillie Gifford, Capital World and Vanguard, while its top three hedge fund investors are Renaissance Technologies, Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co and Citadel, according to Refinitiv data. One seller in the quarter was Saudi Arabia s public investment fund, according to a recent filing.

5/CENTRAL BANKING IN THE TIME OF CORONA
A clutch of central banks are set to meet in days to come as the death toll from the deadly virus outbreak has crossed the 600 mark while analysts are still counting the costs to the global economy.
While major global central banks including the Fed and the Reserve Bank of Australia have warned of a significant hit from the virus to economic output in recent days, they have stopped short of loosening monetary policy outright.
But not so their emerging market counterparts. Both Philippines and Thailand cut interest rates unexpectedly this week while Singapore, which controls policy via its currency, said its local dollar has more room to weaken.
Emerging market central banks have more reason to fear the impact of the dreaded virus. China now accounts for a third of global growth compared to only 10% during the SARS epidemic, and the economies with the strongest trade ties with Beijing are feeling the heat.
With multiple channels of exposure including trade, tourism and services, central banks from Sweden to Indonesia will have plenty of food for thought when policy-makers meet in the coming weeks.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open marginally higher Monday, rebounding after Friday’s losses which bucked an otherwise strong week. But these gains are likely to be limited as China’s coronavirus outbreak continues to claim victims and cause economic damage.

At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 100 up 16 points, or 0.2%, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract rose 8 points, or 0.1%. 
On Friday, both the S&P 500 cash index and the Nasdaq closed down 0.5%, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9%. However, despite these losses, the Dow posted its best weekly gain since August last year, the S&P since June, and the Nasdaq had its strongest week since November 2018.
This provides some room for investors to take profits, particularly as the earnings season starts to draw to a close. There are just 68 S&P 500 companies reporting results in the week ahead, with numbers from Restaurant Brands International, Allergan  and Loews  set to capture the market s attention on Monday.

Additionally, shares in Tesla  soared 9% premarket, continuing the stock’s recent volatile run, after the electric car maker reopened its $2 billion Shanghai production facility Monday. Factory restarts across China have been in doubt after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
A large number of China’s workers travelled back to offices and factories around the country, but many workplaces still remained closed, including key Apple  supplier Foxconn that had sought official permission to open, while many white-collar workers continued to work from home. 
The death toll from the disease has officially overtaken that of the SARS outbreak almost two decades ago, as China reported the total number of deaths at 910, with over 40,000 people affected.
The death of a whistleblower doctor last week and the disappearance of citizen journalists in Wuhan who were reporting on the outbreak have also raised suspicions that the scale of the outbreak may be being understated.
The toll on China s already-slowing economy has been heavy, with Goldman Sachs  cutting its first quarter GDP target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying an even deeper hit is possible.

U.S. economic releases are thin on the ground Monday, so focus could be on speeches from Federal Reserve members Michelle Bowman and Patrick Harker. These come ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivering his semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The Fed chair is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold given that the labor market continues to tighten and private consumption growth remains solid.
Elsewhere, oil headed lower Monday, continuing last week’s losses when the complex posted its fifth weekly loss in a row. Doubts remain over the extent of production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+. "

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Wall Street edged higher at the opening on Monday, reversing earlier losses on continued fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the world economy, amidst reports that China’s factories were slow to return to work after a lengthy and enforce New Year holiday.
By 10:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 80 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.4%, all seemingly content to await congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday and Wednesday before committing to any bigger moves.
Uncertainty was the watchword on Monday, owing to the difficulty of forming a coherent picture of how quickly China’s factories and shops can return to anything like their pre-holiday level of activity.
Apple  stock, for example, fell 0.6% amid conflicting reports about the reopening of factories belonging to Hon Hai Precision – also known as Foxconn – where the bulk of iPhones are made.
Reuters reported that Foxconn had reopened factories with staffing levels at around 10% of normal, while Bloomberg reported that the company had sent a message to staff on its internal app saying that it couldn’t give a date for the resumption of production.
Market research firm Trendforce said on Monday it had cut its forecast for iPhone production by about 10% to 41 million handsets for the three months through March. The only bright spot for Apple  is that the first quarter of the calendar year is in any case normally the slowest.
Tesla  stock leaped 4.9% but was off intraday highs after a highly speculative analysis in Forbes touting a possible takeover by Alphabet . Additionally, initial enthusiasm about the partial reopening of its Shanghai plant gave way to the realization that production – and cash flow – may take weeks if not months to ramp up fully. Reports suggested that the ramp up at Tesla and elsewhere will be delayed by the quarantining of laborers who return from holidays from other parts of the country.
Chinese state media on Monday ran an interview with a leading local virologist suggesting that the incubation period for the coronavirus could be as much as 24 days, rather than the 14 reported hitherto.
Elswhere among individual stocks on Monday, struggling mall operator Taubman Centers  stock rose 53% after rival Simon Property  offered to buy one-third of the Taubman family stake in a deal that values the group at $3.6 billion including debt. The deal still needs approval from Taubman’s free shareholders.
  Exxon Mobil    stock dipped back towards a new 10-year low again as U.S. crude futures tumbled below $50 a barrel again on growing fears that OPEC and its ally Russia aren’t acting to stop a new glut forming on world markets as Chinese demand collapses.
Stocks also came under pressure from the strengthening dollar, which hit its highest level since October against developed-market peers, including a four-month high against the euro."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq made a positive start to the week on Monday, closing at record highs as strong gains for mega-cap tech stocks overshadowed concerns about the coronavirus impact.

The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, Nasdaq Composite added 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.55%.

The World Health Organization’s Dr. Sylvia Briand told reporters the coronavirus produces mild cold symptoms in about 80% of the cases seen so far, with just 15% of those infected ending up with pneumonia and 3% to 5% of patients needing intensive care.

The world health watchdog did expressed concerns, however, about new cases of the virus emerging outside mainland China, which it warned could be a ""spark that becomes a bigger fire.""
Recent economic data, including the better-than-expected U.S. jobs report last week, has underpinned investor hopes that the economy would be able to withstand the fallout from the virus, with some betting that central banks will act in the event of a prolonged outbreak.

""We expect the novel coronavirus to have a negative impact on the overall Chinese economy, and, potentially slowing China s GDP growth by 100-to-200 basis points in the first quarter of the year,"" DA Davidson said.
But ""based on the SARS impact in 2003, we believe that economic growth will rebound rapidly, after the nCoV outbreak is contained,"" the firm added.

The virus outbreak aside, tech stocks reigned on Wall Street, with Nvidia, in particular, rallying ahead of its earnings due Thursday.  

Nvidia  jumped 4.5%, buoyed by a price upgrade from RBC to $301 From $258.
""We raise our estimates on NVDA as we think the January quarter will come in a bit ahead of the high-end of guide due to better than expected gaming and data center demand,"" RBC said in a note.

A rise in consumer discretionary, led by Amazon  and L Brands , also played a role in a broad-based move higher.

L Brands closed more than 2% higher as the company is reportedly nearing a deal to sell Victoria s Secret to private equity company Sycamore Partners.

Elsewhere, Tesla  pared some gains, but ended the day 3% higher after the electric automaker restarted production at its China factory after operations were disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.
Slack Technologies  jumped 15.6% on a report that  IBM  is switching to its workplace messaging and communications software. The stock gave back some gains post-market after the company downplayed the report, leaving its guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter unchanged.
Slack also clarified that  IBM   has been its largest customer for several years and has expanded its usage of the messaging platform over that time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House budget released on Monday proposed cutting funding for the U.S. government-owned passenger rail carrier Amtrak while calling for a significant hike in infrastructure spending and killing a clean energy auto loan program.
The proposal would cut Amtrak funds in fiscal 2021 by more than 50% over 2020 levels. It could cut funds to the congested northeast corridor from $700 million to $325 million and cut long-distance train funds from $1.3 billion to $611 million, then phase out support for Amtrak s long-distance trains.
Democrats are not likely to go along with the proposal, which is similar to cuts that have been rebuffed in prior budgets proposed by the administration of President Donald Trump.
Trump has also sparred with Democratic lawmakers over a $13 billion infrastructure project to build and repair tunnels and bridges in the New York City area known as ""Gateway"" that is critical to Amtrak ridership in the northeast.
In November, Amtrak said it had set records for ridership, revenue, and financial performance for the year ended Sept. 30, 2019, including 32.5 million customer trips, a year-over-year increase of 800,000 passengers.
Amtrak reported a loss of $29.8 million in the year compared with a loss of $170.6 million in the prior fiscal year.
The Trump budget calls for $810 billion in highway, transit, safety and other surface transportation funds and an additional $190 billion for other projects. It does not specify how to pay for the repairs or for funding the projected $261 billion shortfall in the highway trust fund over the next 10 years.
Joel Szabat, a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Transportation, told reporters on a call the administration was ""committed to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to find a responsible way of funding"" the shortfall.
Monday s budget again also calls for eliminating an Energy Department clean vehicle loan program that boosted Tesla  Inc, Nissan Motor Co and Ford Motor  Co during the last industry downturn, but has not funded a new project in almost a decade.
Start-up Lordstown Motors Chief Executive Steve Burns told Reuters last month the company wanted to apply for a $200 million loan from the program to retool a former General Motors  factory in Lordstown, Ohio.
Burns met with Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette for an hour to discuss the proposal last month. Lordstown, which is partially owned by start-up Workhorse Group Inc, said Monday it has not decided whether to apply.
Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, criticized the proposal to kill the Energy Department program.
""This isn’t a hand-out, this is a loan,"" Ryan said.
The budget also again proposes killing the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that phases out for each automaker after they sell 200,000 EVs."

Key Developments

China Home Sales Plunge Due to Virus (1:29 p.m. HK)
Home sales in China have been dealt a huge blow by the spreading coronavirus, with figures showing transactions plunged in the first week of February. New apartment sales dropped 90% from the same period of 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co. Sales of existing homes plummeted 91% in eight cities where data is available.
CDC Confirms 13th Case in the U.S. (11:38 a.m. HK)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed another case of coronavirus in California, bringing the number in the U.S. to 13.
The latest patient is in San Diego, and was among citizens evacuated from Wuhan to the U.S. and under quarantine. The CDC said it is conducting an investigation to determine the patient’s contacts and assess if they had high risk exposure.
Trump Sees Warm Weather Curbing Outbreak (11:31 a.m. HK)
The U.S. has about a dozen people suffering from the coronavirus but all are expected to recover, U.S. President Donald Trump said.
Trump, speaking to Fox Business Network on Monday, said he believes warm weather will curb the spread of the disease beginning in April, and that Chinese authorities have the outbreak under control.
“I really believe that they’re going to have it under control fairly soon,” he said.
Hong Kong Won’t Enact Mask Laws (11:12 a.m. HK)
Hong Kong authorities have no plans to enact laws regulating the city’s supply of surgical masks, Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters at a weekly briefing.
Lam has faced criticism from the public in recent days as a mask shortage sent people scrambling to form long lines at pharmacies, while residents distrustful of her administration after months of pro-democracy protests staged a run on toilet paper. She urged Hong Kongers to reduce their number of social interactions as the city works to ward off a wider outbreak.
“We are making an appeal to people of Hong Kong to stay at home as much as possible,” she said. “This means they should avoid some social interactions, participation in social activities and family reunion and friends meeting.”
She said the government wasn’t calling for compusory closures, “because Hong Kong is a free society” and business operators were already taking strong precautionary measures.
Philippine Carriers Suspend Taiwan Flights (11:03 a.m. HK)
Philippine Airlines Inc. and Cebu Air Inc. have suspended their Taiwan flights after the Philippines expanded its travel ban on the novel coronavirus. The order temporarily barring the entry and departure of foreign nationals from China, Hong Kong and Macau will also cover Taiwan, the Bureau of Immigration said. Both carriers suspended the Taiwan flights starting Tuesday.

Singapore Sees Up to 30% Drop in Tourism (10:32 a.m. HK)
Singapore could see a 25% to 30% decline in tourist arrivals and spending this year because of the coronavirus outbreak, as the industry braces for a worse impact than the 2003 SARS pandemic, the city’s tourism chief said.
The city-state is losing about 18,000 to 20,000 tourists a day, and the figures could plummet further if the situation persists for longer, Keith Tan, chief executive of Singapore Tourism Board, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
China accounts for about 20% of Singapore’s tourism intake, the biggest source of visitors ahead of Indonesia and India. China’s ban on outbound tour groups and Singapore’s move to bar Chinese nationals from entering has led to an “evaporation” of a key source of revenue, Tan said.
China’s Hubei Province Removes Top Health Officials (9:04 a.m. HK)
China’s Hubei province at the center of the virus outbreak has removed health commission head Liu Yingzi and party chief Zhang Jin from their posts, state-run CCTV reported.
Criticism has mounted over China’s transparency and speed in handling the epidemic. The government’s struggle to stem the outbreak has fueled concerns about President Xi Jinping’s efforts to centralize power since taking office, with officials pointing fingers over who’s to blame for the spread of the illness.
The death last week of a 34-year-old doctor, Li Wenliang, who was sanctioned by local authorities after warning about the disease, unleashed a torrent of grief and anger on social media.
Thailand Says Ship Won’t Be Allowed to Disembark (8:56 a.m. HK)
Passengers from a ship that has been blocked from other ports due to virus concerns won’t be given permission to disembark in Thailand, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook  posting.
The Westerdam cruise ship, operated by Carnival  Corp.’s Holland America, has been refused entry by a number of nations over fears that passengers may be carrying the coronavirus.
The ship departed Hong Kong on Feb. 1 with 1,455 passengers and 802 crew. It is set to arrive at a port near Bangkok on Thursday, and checks with health authorities indicate there is “no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board the ship,” Holland America said in a statement Monday.
Elderly May Be Released From Japan Ship: Kyodo (8:32 a.m. HK)
The Japanese government may allow senior citizens and people with chronic illnesses to leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship on Tuesday morning, Kyodo news reported, citing people it didn’t identify.
The number of coronavirus infections among those aboard the Carnival Corp. ship quarantined off Yokohama has nearly doubled to 135, making it the biggest center of infection of any place outside of China.
Risks are mounting that the virus could spread further in the confined spaces of the ship, where many onboard have increased vulnerability due to their advanced ages.
Hong Kong Public Housing Residents Evacuated (8:30 a.m. HK)
More than 100 people at a public housing estate in Hong Kong were evacuated in the early hours of Tuesday after two people in the tower were confirmed to have contracted the novel coronavirus, South China Morning Post reported.
The move was precautionary after a 62-year-old woman, who lives several floors directly below a man who had earlier confirmed with the virus infection, became the 42nd cases in Hong Kong, according to the report.
China Death Toll at 1,016 (8:17 a.m. HK)
The death toll in China from the coronavirus rose to 1,016, with the addition of 108 fatalities for Feb. 10, according to the National Health Commission. Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, reported 103 more deaths, its highest daily count so far.
While the total confirmed cases in mainland China climbed to 42,638, Hubei reported 2,097 new infections, the smallest daily increase since Feb. 1.
Most cases and deaths in China are in Hubei. Large parts of the province have been cut off from the rest of China since the government started imposing a quarantine on Jan. 23 to try and stop the spread of the virus.
Two additional deaths have occurred outside of mainland China: one in Hong Kong and the other in the Philippines.
Ford Reopens China Plants (11:30 a.m. NY)
Ford Motor  Co. has resumed production at its Chinese plants, a spokesman said.
The U.S. automaker is working with its supplier partners, some of which are located in Hubei province, to assess and plan for parts supply, according to Anderson Chan, a spokesman.
Ford was among the major automakers that halted production at China plants late last month as the government extended the traditional Lunar New Year holiday by a week.
Tesla  Inc. also reopened its plant near Shanghai on Monday.
New Estimate Puts Virus Death Rate at 1% (10:37 a.m. NY)
The mortality rate from the coronavirus is an estimated 1%, researchers at the Imperial College London said in a new report that attempts to account for mild cases as well as more severe ones at the center of the outbreak in China.
Researchers have been trying to estimate how severe the virus is, and to calculate how fast it spreads as well as how many people get severe illnesses or die. In China’s Hubei province, where the outbreak began, the fatality rate may be 18% for patients with severe symptoms, the researchers calculated.
“The impact of the unfolding epidemic may be comparable to the major influenza pandemics of the twentieth century,” Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease researcher at Imperial College London, said in a statement.
The researchers said the 1% mortality rate was an estimate of what will happen once all cases are counted, and after previously undiagnosed ones drive the rate down.
Any estimates ”should be viewed cautiously” given the numerous uncertainties involved, the researchers warned in in their report. Mortality rates tend to shift in the middle of an outbreak as new and milder cases are found.
The U.K. researchers estimated that the typical time between onset of symptoms and death has been about 22 days, meaning that there may be a multiweek time lag between reporting of cases and when deaths from those cases become apparent.
Overall, the Imperial College London researchers estimated that 1.3% of Wuhan residents were infected with the virus as of Jan. 31, but only 1 in 19 of them were being tested for the virus – suggesting that the actual number of cases could be far higher than the official numbers indicate.
Toymaker: Closing May Hurt Holiday Sales (10:15 a.m. NY)
The CEO of one the world’s largest toymakers said many of its largest Chinese suppliers remain shuttered because of the coronavirus outbreak, with some pushing reopening dates back to the end of next month.
“It’s bad,” said Isaac Larian, who also founded closely held MGA Entertainment Inc. “People don’t realize. This won’t just affect the toy business; it’s going to have a major economic effect worldwide.”
While the idled factories haven’t had a major impact on MGA so far, prolonged closings could delay orders for the holiday-shopping season, according to Larian. China is by far the biggest maker of toys, with the industry’s hub in Shenzhen, and February and March is when factories do the bulk of production for Christmas goods that hit shelves beginning in late October.
U.K. Issues Tighter Quarantine Rules (9:55 a.m. NY)
Britain imposed new regulations allowing health authorities to keep individuals in quarantine if they’re considered to be at risk of infecting others. The move came as the U.K. government called the novel coronavirus a “serious and imminent” threat to public health.
The rules apply to anyone seeking to leave isolation before a 14-day quarantine is complete and will be in place for future cases, the government said Monday. Four more patients in England tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the U.K. to eight. The country has also flown back Britons from the virus epicenter of Wuhan, China, and they’re now being held in quarantine.
China’s Xi Makes Public Appearance (6:20 a.m. NY)
Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first public appearance after the death of a doctor who became a hero for speaking out about the deadly coronavirus sparked public anger.
Xi visited the Chaoyang district in Beijing Monday afternoon “to learn about the situation of epidemic prevision and control at the grassroots level,” according to state-run media Xinhua. The agency published photos of Xi wearing a mask and having his temperature taken.
It was the first time Xi interacted with the public since a trip to Yunnan province from Jan. 19 to Jan. 21, part of a tradition the country’s leaders have of touring smaller towns and cities ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday. The president was last seen in public when he met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Feb. 5.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Tesla  driver killed in a March 2018 crash in California while using the Autopilot driver-assistance system had reported that on prior trips, the car had steered away from the highway, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) disclosed in documents made public Tuesday.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple  software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in Mountain View in autopilot mode at about 70 mph when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had reported issues on prior trips with Autopilot steering the wheel toward an area between a highway ramp and the lane. It is a moving violation to cross into that section of the road, known as the ""gore area.""
Data from the vehicle showed that in prior trips Huang had taken corrective action after Autopilot had steered toward the area. The NTSB said in the fatal crash Huang s hands were not detected on the steering wheel in the final six seconds before the crash. There was no evidence of braking or evasive action.
The NTSB, which also found evidence that the driver was using a smartphone during the trip, plans a Feb. 25 hearing to determine the probable cause of the crash. Tesla did not immediately comment.
Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, but the company advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.
During the final 18-minute Autopilot segment of the trip, the system did not detect his hands on the wheel about one-third of the time and the system issued two visual alerts for hands-off driving operation and one auditory alert.
The NTSB said Huang had been using an Apple-owned iPhone during his trip and records show evidence of data transmissions.
Logs recovered with Apple s assistance show a word building game application ""Three Kingdoms"" was active during Huang s fatal trip.
The NTSB said ""most players have both hands on the phone to support the device and manipulate game actions"" but added the log data ""does not provide enough information to ascertain whether the Tesla driver was holding the phone or how interactive he was with the game at the time of the crash.""
The NTSB, which previously criticized Tesla’s driver assistance system Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, said in September the system’s design permitted a ""driver to disengage from the driving task” in an earlier California crash."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc  is recalling 15,000 Model X SUVs because of a potential issue that can lead to a loss of power steering assist that could make steering harder and increase the risk of a crash.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada said aluminum bolts that attach the electric power steering gear assist motor to the gear housing may corrode and break causing a reduction or complete loss of power steering assist.
The recall applies to 2016 model year X vehicles. Tesla said the vehicles being recalled include most Model X vehicles built before mid-October 2016, but the move does not affect vehicles built after that date.Tesla issued a similar recall in March 2018 for 123,000 Model S vehicles worldwide built before April 2016 that called for replacing steering assist motor bolts.
NHTSA said there are no known crashes or injuries associated with the Model X recall. The recall covers 14,193 U.S. vehicles and 843 in Canada. Tesla will arrange for the replacement of the mounting bolts and will also replace the steering gear if needed, Transport Canada said.
Tesla said it has ""observed excessive corrosion on the bolts that attach this component to the steering gear in affected Model X vehicles"" and primarily in areas with very cold climates that use road salts. Tesla said if the bolts fail it would require ""more force to turn the steering wheel, especially during low speed parking maneuvers.""
Tesla said it was not aware of any injuries or collisions relating to the power steering component.
Tesla added drivers can continue to operate their Model X SUVs before the issue is addressed. Tesla said it will contact owners to schedule appointments when parts are available.
Tesla said it will also apply a corrosion-preventative sealer in all affected Model X vehicles to account for the possibility that vehicles may later be used in cold climates.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Thursday, retracing after a series of record highs as the number of people officially recorded as being affected by the coronavirus outbreak in China soared.

At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 24 points, or 0.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 75 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow Jones futures contract fell 211 points, or 0.7%. 
China s Hubei province, where the Covid-19 virus is believed to have originated, reported 242 new deaths late Wednesday, double the previous day s toll, and confirmed 14,840 new cases. This pushed the national death toll above 1,350 - with almost 60,000 infections in total.
The rise in the number of Hubei cases came as officials adopted a new methodology for counting infections, effectively lowering the bar for classifying new infections.

This dent to sentiment presented a selling opportunity, particularly as Wall Street notched Wednesday a third-straight record close this week. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.9%. U.S. stocks have been having their best month since June last year.

With China in mind, e-commerce giant   Alibaba    reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as its core e-commerce and Cloud computing businesses posted steady growth. These results, however, are for the three-month period just before the coronavirus outbreak.
Elsewhere, Tesla  is likely to be in the spotlight after announcing the recall of 15,000 Model X SUVs because of concerns over the potential loss of power steering.

Shares in Cisco Systems  will be in focus after offering up a lackluster forecast for third-quarter revenue and profit, while MGM Resorts  scrapped its earnings guidance for 2020 and announced that chief executive James Murren was leaving ahead of schedule.

Inflation numbers lead Thursday’s economic calendar, with the January consumer price index due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). This is expected to have risen 0.2% last month, the same as it rose in December

At the same time, weekly initial jobless claims figures will also be released, with claims for first-time unemployment benefits for the week seen bouncing up to 210,000 from the unexpectedly low 202,000 seen the week before.
Elsewhere, the oil market fell back Thursday, after the International Energy Agency said late Wednesday that global oil demand will drop this quarter, by 435,000 barrels a day, for the first time in over a decade on the back of the coronavirus damage.

AT 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $50.98 a barrel, after having fallen below $50 to a one-year low last week. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $55.31.

The S&P 500 Index opened lower, a day after hitting fresh records, as the jump in infections undercut optimism the spread of the virus was slowing. Treasuries trimmed an earlier gain after a mixed reading of American consumer prices.
“The sudden sharp re-acceleration in new coronavirus infections in China has investors reassessing risk,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. “Given the inherent uncertainty of this macro risk, we believe a focus on the bottom line can be helpful. While China and travel-focused companies are obviously most vulnerable, as long as the economic impact on the U.S. economy remains modest, expect U.S. equities to maintain their relative immunity to the virus.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was on pace for its biggest drop this month. The euro traded near the lowest since 2017, while the U.K. pound gained and gilts retreated after Sajid Javid quit as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The FTSE 100 Index also declined.
Investor sentiment had improved in recent sessions amid speculation the impact from the coronavirus outbreak on global growth would be short-lived. That assumption was thrown into doubt when Hubei, the province at the center of the epidemic, reported almost 15,000 new cases after it revised its data to include “clinically diagnosed” cases in its daily disclosure.
In company news, Tesla  Inc. shares fell after the carmaker announced plans to offer about $2 billion of common stock.  Alibaba   Group Holding Ltd. fell after warning that its revenue growth will be negatively impacted in the March quarter.  Barclays   Plc slipped as the bank revealed British regulators are probing Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley’s relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Elsewhere, stock gauges in Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong and South Korea all declined, though shares in Australia edged higher. Oil continued Wednesday’s surge even as the International Energy Agency said the coronavirus means global demand will drop this quarter for the first time in over a decade.

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday as market participants took money off the table in response to a sharp rise in confirmed coronavirus cases in China, which tempered earlier hopes that the disease will peak soon.

By 10:10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 165 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5%. 

Outside of the DJIA, Tesla  stock fell 0.4%,  the electric vehicle maker paring early losses after saying it wants to sell up to $2 billion in new stock via a secondary offering.  
The broad risk-off move in markets followed a decision by Chinese authorities to rejig its way of counting cases of the Covid-19 virus in such a way as to correct previous under-reporting. The Communist Party also fired its top officials responsible for the city of Wuhan and the region of Hubei, the outbreak’s epicenter.
The outbreak was indirectly behind a 6.3% drop in Cisco Systems , which warned after the closing bell on Wednesday that related macroeconomic uncertainty was likely to depress investment spending by businesses. Cisco, a maker of routers and other telecoms gear, is viewed by some a good rough proxy for business investment.
Kraft Heinz  stock was another big loser, the food group losing 7.9% after reporting a steeper drop in organic sales for the last quarter of 2019 than had been expected. Overall organic sales fell 2.2%, rather than the 0.9% forecast, while U.S. sales fell by an even sharper 2.7%.

Among the biggest gainers was e-commerce company Shopify , which shrugged off valuation-driven downgrades from   Credit Suisse    and others after soaring on the back of better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday.
Also making a big move up was insurance giant AIG , whose core underwriting business returned to profit in the fourth quarter from a $1.1 billion loss a year earlier.
Oil and gas stocks remained under pressure after the International Energy Agency joined OPEC and the U.S. government in slashing its forecasts for global oil demand. The IEA said global demand growth would fall by 325,000 barrels a day on average this year, while demand could drop in absolute terms in the first quarter due to the Covid-19 outbreak. 
  Exxon Mobil    fell 0.2%, while   Marathon Oil    - an upstream exploration and production specialist - fell 7.2% to its lowest in two and a half years."

(Reuters) - Tesla  Inc on Thursday announced plans to raise $2 billion in a stock offering, tapping into an astronomical jump in its share price over the past few months and reversing the electric-car maker s often-stated policy of avoiding sales of new stock.
Tesla said it would offer 2.65 million shares, of which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk will buy up to $10 million in shares, while board member and Oracle  co-founder Larry Ellison will purchase up to $1 million worth of Tesla shares.
Tesla s shares were down roughly 1% in morning trading, retracing losses after sliding as much as 7% in premarket trading. The stock has tripled since October when the company posted a rare quarterly profit. Its market capitalization now exceeds the combined value of General Motors Co  and Ford Motor  Co.
Musk has repeatedly assured investors that Tesla will not need to raise more money for costly initiatives including production of a new vehicle model, the ramp-up of its China production and the construction of its first European factory.
""It doesn t make sense to raise money,"" Musk said during a Jan. 29 earnings call when an investor asked why Tesla does not take advantage of its favorable share price to accelerate production. Musk said the company would generate enough cash on its own to fund ambitious expansion plans.
""Diluting the company to pay down debt doesn t sound like a wise move,"" Musk said on the same call.
Musk also said Tesla needed to produce more batteries to increase vehicle production, adding that some projects like its electric semi-trailer truck program could not proceed without battery improvements.
Tesla is also working on an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster, an electric sports car, and automated driving features. The company did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on how to reconcile Thursday s announcement with Musk s previous statements.
The decision to raise money will come as a shock to some investors following Musk s previous comments, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.
""In our opinion the size of this offering is larger than many had anticipated, but we believe it’s a smart move by Musk and the Board to take advantage of being back in a position of strength,"" Ives said.
Tesla, whose outstanding debt was $13.42 billion at the end of 2019, posted its second quarterly profit in a row in January and said it would comfortably make more than half a million cars this year.
The company said it plans to use proceeds from the offering to strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes.
Tesla raised about $2.3 billion in May to start production in China and spend on developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck, whose launch has been delayed due to a lack of battery production capacity.
Since the last capital raise, Tesla has built a $2 billion factory in Shanghai and unveiled the futuristic Cybertruck pickup. The Shanghai factory started delivering cars last month.

It’s been a busy Thursday morning for the electric-vehicle phenomenon. Not long after Tesla Inc. filed its 10-K annual report, the company announced it would sell up to $2.3 billion worth of new equity, with CEO Elon Musk and director Ellison indicating their “preliminary interest” in buying $10 million and $1 million worth, respectively.
The 10-K itself contained several interesting details. There was a reference to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking information on unspecified contracts and financing arrangements. Regional data for 2019 showed sales in Tesla’s biggest market, the U.S., fell by 15%. Meanwhile, the full cash flow statement confirmed that $204 million of fourth-quarter cash from operations was largely a mix of foreign-exchange gains and amortization and write-down effects. As I wrote  here, along with a positive swing in working capital and sales of regulatory credits, those “other” items contributed more than half of Tesla’s free cash flow in the quarter.
Let’s stay with free cash flow. Another item in the 10-K was Tesla’s capital expenditure guidance. This is notable because management was unusually reticent on that item when it announced year-end results about two weeks ago, telling investors and analysts to wait for the filing. It is also notable because the new guidance implies a jump of somewhere between 88% and 164% this year — and maybe staying there through 2022.
One of the strange things about Tesla is that its valuation and ambitious narrative are pure growth-stock stuff, but its capex in 2019 was  more like that of an old car business. At 62%, its ratio of capex to depreciation wasn’t much different from the 54% reported by General Motors Co . Now it seems as if Tesla will make up for that and then some. Plotting the new guidance versus consensus forecasts shows just how much last year stood out in this regard.
The final capex bill for 2019 was $1.3 billion. That’s about $1.2 billion lower than the original guidance given a year ago. Meanwhile, Tesla’s free cash flow in 2019 was $1.1 billion.
Which brings us back to the surprise equity raise. It’s a surprise because, about two weeks ago, Musk answered a question on this very subject by saying “it doesn’t make sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level.” It’s also a surprise because Tesla had $6.3 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of December. Plus, the company expects “positive quarterly free cash flow going forward, with possible temporary exceptions.” Certainly, current consensus forecasts for free cash flow imply Tesla could absorb the jump in capex without resort to new financing.
It shouldn’t be that surprising, though. Tesla’s stock has gone parabolic. Just six months ago, a $2.3 billion equity raise would have diluted shareholders by almost 6%; at today’s price, it’s just 1.6%. Investors may as well be begging the company to sell more equity (Musk’s  compensation package encourages this too)."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – Wall Street clawed back the bulk of losses Thursday as coronavirus-led selling cooled despite a surge in deaths and infections in China.

The S&P 500 fell 0.04%, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.19% .

A new method of diagnosing Covid-19 pushed the death toll above 1,300 and indicated that as many as 59,804 are infected, raising worries that the outbreak may be worse than many had feared.

China also confirmed 254 more deaths from disease and 15,152 new cases. But the White House thinks that China is still under-reporting cases and deaths and also noted it is not accepting offers of help from the U.S., according to published reports.

A rise in the number of infections outside mainland China exacerbated fears of contagion, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirming the 15th case of an individual in the U.S. with the virus.

Selling was seen across airline stocks as investors reassessed the risk to global travel from virus, with American Airlines  and United Airlines  down about 1%.
Energy stocks fell sharply, shrugging off a rise in oil prices amid growing hopes that Russia will support OPEC+ proposals for deeper production cuts.
In earnings, Cisco Systems  fell 2% after its better-than-expected earnings were overshadowed by its gloomy outlook on revenue.  

The networking giant guided third-quarter annualized revenue to decline by 1.5% to 3.5%. Cisco  said the Covid-19 outbreak could keep businesses away from making major investment decisions.
MGM Resorts  slumped 5% after it pulled its 2020 guidance amid concerns about impact of the coronavirus concerns. The company also said its chief executive Jim Murren would step down.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P ended the day well off of its lows Thursday after the World Health Organization suggested the spike in coronavirus infections may not have occurred in a day, easing fears of contagion.

The S&P 500 fell 0.18%, Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.14% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.43%.
""We are not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,"" the WHO said in a press release after China reported 254 more deaths and 15,152 new infections.

The health watchdog said the surge in infections likely included individuals who had been infected a number of days or even weeks ago after China adopted a new method of diagnosing Covid-19 (coronavirus).
Ahead of the WHO s remarks, stocks were deeply in the red amid fears the jump in infections and deaths in China signaled a change in trajectory for the virus, stoking worries about contagion.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the fifteenth case of an individual in the U.S. with the virus.

The major indexes had made it into the green in afternoon trading, but weakened when the Federal Reserve said it will shrink its repurchase agreement operations further as of tomorrow s overnight offering. Any hint the Fed is taking the punch bowl away tends to result in knee-jerk selling.
Earnings also influenced direction, with industrials taking hit from a slump in shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls.

Huntington Ingalls Industries  slipped about 7% after its fourth-quarter results fell short of estimates.

Cisco Systems  fell more than 5% as investors expressed concerns over growth after the company’s earnings beat was driven by its services rather than the higher-margin switching products segment.

Energy, meanwhile, failed to hitch a ride on a sharp upswing in oil prices amid growing hopes Russia will back the OPEC plan to cut output in the wake of Covid-19 s hit to Chinese oil demand.
Not everyone is convinced that action from OPEC and its allies will be enough to offset the virus  impact on oil demand.   

""Global oil stocks to pile up as proposed (600,000 bpd) OPEC cuts are no match for coronavirus-induced surplus,"" Rystad Energy said.

Tesla  Inc. taps Wall Street for funds to turn them into reality. Banks pocket millions in fees. And rather than punish the company for diluting its shareholders, the market sends the stock higher.
The virtuous circle has enabled Tesla to raise about $14 billion over the last decade, supporting the electric-car maker through countless ups and downs. The latest offering, announced Thursday, boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to almost $146 billion, behind only Toyota Motor Corp. among the world’s most valuable auto manufacturers.
While Tesla watchers have seen this movie before, the latest script was full of twist and turns. Musk, 48, said during an earnings call two weeks ago that it didn’t make sense for the company to raise capital again. The maker of the Model 3 sedan has been spending money sensibly, he said, without holding back expenditures that would inhibit progress.
But the ascent Tesla’s stock has been on in recent months evidently changed the chief executive officer’s mind. Tesla will use the proceeds -- at least $2 billion -- from the offering to shore up its balance sheet and help fund Musk’s seemingly endless aspirations.
After Musk and Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn demurred weeks ago when asked how much spending Tesla had planned for this year, the company disclosed earlier Thursday that its budget will be as much as $3.5 billion, more than double last year’s.
Chinese banks are footing much of the bill for the factory Musk just opened near Shanghai, but he’s also already planning to build his next one near Berlin and teasing the possibility of another one going up in Texas.
Tesla is no longer a tiny niche player that makes cool-but-expensive cars only in high-cost California, but getting to this point required taking on about $12.5 billion of debt, double the amount of cash and equivalents it had at year end.
“Musk had previously assured investors that he did not plan to raise additional capital,” Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, said in a report. “However, while Elon backpedaling on his promises is a common criticism of Tesla, the company’s balance sheet is a much more common (and valid) criticism.”
Tesla’s stock has more than tripled since the company released the first of two positive quarterly earnings reports. Musk has accelerated the production schedule for the Model Y, the crossover SUV that he sees becoming the company’s new top seller.
But the Model Y isn’t expected to contribute significantly to deliveries in the first few months of the year, and Kirkhorn has cautioned that first-quarter sales probably will slow down because of seasonality. Production in China also was temporarily halted due to the coronavirus, and ramping up output of Model 3s there and Model Ys in California is expected to pinch profit margins.
Tesla managed to time its latest offering before any of those risks weighed on the stock ahead of its next earnings report. The company is selling the shares at $767 apiece, according to a person familiar with the matter -- a 4.6% discount to Thursday’s close.
With all that Musk has planned -- eventually rolling out the Semi, Roadster and Cybertruck models and recommitting to a foundering rooftop-solar business -- some investors and analysts think the company should try to raise enough money so that it’s really done needing to seek more from now on.
While the amount the company has taken in during the last decade is significant, it’s not unprecedented. Netflix Inc . took in about $15 billion in the same span, almost entirely from debt offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“We have long wanted Tesla to raise a large amount of cash via stock issuance due to its lofty valuation and then perhaps never need to raise capital again,” David Whiston, a Morningstar Inc. analyst, said in a note. “We’d like to see more consistency between the company’s actions and the words of CEO Elon Musk.”"

By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets drifted at the opening on Friday as fresh signs of weakness in U.S. factories blunted a relentless advance.

Industrial production fell 0.3% in January, according to data released earlier, more than the 0.2% drop seen. Capacity utilization also fell to 76.8%, within a whisker of its lowest since 2018.
The news followed data showing the U.S. consumer, at least, remained untouched by fears of the Covid-19 outbreak in January – retail sales rising 0.3% on the month despite a drop in clothing sales.

By 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 32 points, or 0.1% at 29,390. The S&P 500 was unchanged and the Nasdaq Composite was up less than 0.1%.

The Nasdaq was supported by a 6.5% rise in chipmaker Nvidia , which posted much stronger than expected earnings for the fourth quarter and issued guidance above Wall Street’s forecast for the current quarter.
Tesla  stock rose 0.5% to $809.50 after the company said it had sold $2 billion of stock at $767 on Thursday – a 4.6% discount to Thursday’s closing price and the biggest discount it has ever offered at a secondary share sale.

  Roku    stock and   Expedia    stock both also rose sharply after exceeding consensus forecasts with quarterly results that they announced late on Thursday. The online travel agent s stock is now almost back where it was before it shocked the market with its previous trading statement.

Kraft Heinz  fell another 4.3%, extending Thursday’s losses after posting disappointing organic sales and goodwill writedowns in the fourth quarter.

Meanwhile   Lyft    fell another 3.5% to its lowest since early January amid ongoing worries about its profitability – despite meeting expectations in its latest quarterly update.
Cannabis stocks were broadly higher after   Canopy Growth    narrowed its losses by more than expected. Canopy Growth stock rose 17.3%, while Tilray  stock climbed 7.7% and Aurora Cannabis   rose 3.1%.
In other markets, crude oil futures bounced amid reports of renewed buying by smaller Chinese refineries, in what was interpreted as a sign that the collapse in spot demand from the world s biggest importer was past its worst.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Ray Dalio s Bridgewater Associates, Viking Global Investors, and Granite Point Capital were among prominent hedge funds placing new bets on electric carmaker Tesla Inc  in the fourth quarter, positioning them to gain from its nearly 100% rally over the first six weeks of the year.
The positions were revealed in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released on Thursday and Friday, which are one of the few public ways of tracking what hedge fund managers are selling and buying. The disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
If each hedge fund had held on to its stake, Bridgewater s purchase of nearly 45,000 shares would be worth approximately $36 million, while Viking s purchase of nearly 52,000 shares would be would be worth slightly more than $42 million. Granite Pointe purchased 3,000 shares in the fourth quarter, which would now be worth approximately $2.5 million.
Mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price, meanwhile, revealed that it had doubled its stake in the company in the fourth quarter, to 1.7 million shares.
The moves into Tesla came as the high tech automaker remained among the most divisive stocks on Wall Street. Bullish investors see founder Elon Musk as reinventing the energy business while bears see an unprofitable company that is significantly over-valued. Tesla s shares were off slightly in afternoon trading in New York on Friday at around $801.00."

The U.S. electric carmaker announced plans last November to build a Gigafactory in Gruenheide in the eastern state of Brandenburg.
The court ruling, by the higher administrative court of the states of Berlin and Brandenburg, comes after the state environmental office gave a green light to clear 92 hectares of forest for the plant.
Planning permission has not yet been granted to build the Gigafactory, however, meaning U.S. entrepreneur Elon Musk s company is preparing the ground at its own risk.
In a statement, the court said it had issued the order to stop the tree-felling because it would have only taken three more days to complete the work.
Otherwise the clearance would have been completed before judges made a final decision on the complaint brought by a local environmentalist group called the Gruene Liga Brandenburg (Green League of Brandenburg).
""It should not be assumed that the motion seeking legal protection brought by the Green League lacks any chance of succeeding,"" the court statement added.
Lawmakers from the pro-business Christian Democrat and Free Democrat parties have warned that the legal battle waged against the Gigafactory would inflict serious and long-lasting damage on Germany s image as a place to do business.
Local and national lawmakers have been caught out by the strength of opposition to the Gigafactory, with hundreds of demonstrators protesting over what they say is the threat it poses to local wildlife and water supplies.
Tesla currently has two Gigafactories in the United States and one in Shanghai, China."

Beijing (Reuters) - Tesla  is in advanced stages of talks to use batteries from CATL (SZ:300750) that contain no cobalt - one of the most expensive metals in electric vehicle (EV) batteries - in cars made at its China plant, people familiar with the matter said.
Adoption would mark the first time for the U.S. automaker to include so-called lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in its lineup, as it seeks to lower production costs amid faltering overall EV sales in China.
Tesla has been talking to the Chinese manufacturer for more than a year to supply LFP batteries that will be cheaper than its existing batteries by a ""double-digit percent,"" said a person directly involved in the matter, who was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified.
Tesla Inc and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) declined to comment.
EV manufacturers usually use nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) or nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries on passenger vehicles because of their higher energy density, which is critical in determining how far an EV can drive on single charge.
To boost the density and safety of its LFP batteries, CATL has been working on its so-called cell-to-pack technology, the people told Reuters.
It was not clear to what extent Tesla intends to use LFP batteries but the automaker has no plans to stop using its current NCA batteries, said one of the people.
Tesla has been ramping up production of its Model 3 cars at its newly built $2 billion Shanghai plant and cutting prices to win market share from conventional premium automakers such as Germany s BMW AG  and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn).
Tesla started to deliver cars from the factory in December, helping it save on shipping costs and tariffs for imported models. It is currently seeking regulatory approval to make longer-range Model 3 cars at the plant.
Sales in China of new energy vehicles - referring to battery-only, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles - likely sank 54.4% in January, industry data showed, due in part to the Lunar New Year holiday starting earlier than last year as well as the impact of the outbreak in China of a new coronavirus.
The use of LFP batteries will also help Chief Executive Elon Musk meet a 2018 promise that Tesla would cut the use of cobalt - which costs some $33,500 a tonne - to ""almost nothing"".

Tesla plans to host a battery event, probably in April, to share its future battery strategy and technology, Musk said at an earnings conference in January."

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street approaches the 20th anniversary of the piercing of the dot-com bubble, today s decade-old rally led by a few small players shows some similarities that cautious investors are keeping an eye on.
March 11, 2000 marked the beginning of a crash of overly-inflated stocks that would last over two years, lead to the failure of investor favorites including Worldcom and Pets.com and take over 13 years for Wall Street to recover from. 
Nasdaq s journey back to highs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HkmAPV
That bust ended a 1,000% decade-long Nasdaq (IXIC) rally that had been fueled by low interest rates and a rush to invest in the emerging World Wide Web, often at any cost.
Tracking the Nasdaq s ""horsemen"" - https://tmsnrt.rs/38f2RNs
Now, after hitting a record high on Feb. 13, the Nasdaq has reached over 9,700 points, almost double its high point in 2000 and about eight times the level of its trough in 2002.
Among the so-called ""Four Horsemen"" of tech stocks that fueled much of the 1990s tech rally, only Microsoft s  stock price has recovered from the dot-com bust. Intel  and Cisco Systems  remain below their 2000 highs, while Dell, the fourth member, has since been taken private and then relisted on the stock market.
The 1990s  remaining horsemen - https://tmsnrt.rs/2USpp2A
Microsoft is dueling with Apple  for the title of Wall Street s most valuable publicly listed company, with its stock quadrupling since CEO Satya Nadella took over as chief in 2014 and refocused the maker of Windows on cloud computing, a technology central to the current rally in Silicon Valley stocks. 
With a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion, Microsoft is now trading at over 30 times expected earnings, its highest valuation since 2002, but still less than half of the highest PE it reached during the dot-com era.
Intel and Cisco, no longer among Wall Street s most-favored tech stocks after investors refocused on software, are trading at PEs in line with recent years.
Apple, Amazon , Google parent Alphabet  and Facebook  have seen their PEs climb recently, but still within ranges seen in recent years as they drove much of the S&P 500 s rally.
S&P 500 and tech PEs since dot.com era - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SLGJDL
But across the stock market, earnings multiples are testing levels that followed soon after the dot-com bubble exploded. The S&P 500 s forward PE recently hit 18.8, its highest since 2002. At 22.5, the S&P 500 tech index s PE is at its highest since 2004, but still nowhere near its peak PE of 48 in 2000.
With Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and other technology companies fueling much of Wall Street s rally since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, some investors worry the market has become vulnerable to any downturn among those companies. 
Shares of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook alone make up about 18% of the benchmark S&P 500.
""While the levels of valuation are not as extreme, the conclusion is somewhat the same from the market standpoint. If for whatever reason these names falter, it s going to be very hard for certainly the Nasdaq, which is even more heavily weighted, but even the broader market, the S&P ... to perform well,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.
Tech market share of the stock market - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UQvb4V
At the height of the dot-com era, technology stocks accounted for over 35% of the S&P 500 s value. Today, the tech sector accounts for about 25% of S&P 500 market capitalization, according to Refinitiv Datastream. But combining the tech sector with the communications sector, which includes Internet-related companies like Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix , the group accounts for 35% of the S&P 500. 
The spate of unprofitable companies seeking to go public in recent years had struck some investors as similar to the dot-com boom. But WeWork s spectacular failure to pull off a multibillion-dollar IPO last year was seen as a positive sign for those concerned about an overly ebullient market and investors  willingness to buy shares of companies with no clear path to profitability.
More recent worries have been sparked by massive -- and to some investors, confusing -- gains for Tesla . The electric vehicle maker s stock price has soared 90% in 2020 alone.
“Watching Tesla this last week felt a lot like the bubble,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell at the opening on Tuesday, as a warning from Apple and disappointing figures from Walmart  validated fears that stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves in pricing in a quick end to the Covid-19 outbreak.
Apple  stock fell 2.7% after the iPhone maker warned of a two-fold hit to revenue, first from a drop in retail sales in China and secondly due to production constraints in its supply chain. It wasn’t able to give any clearer update on the expected impact of the virus, but warned it would not reach the $63 billion lower end of its guidance range.
Walmart  stock, by contrast, recovered from early losses to be up 0.5% after missing expectations for fourth-quarter sales. While its guidance for 30% online sales growth also represented a slowdown from last year’s 37%, markets took the view that the possible leakage of business to Amazon.com  isn’t as bad as it might be.

By 9:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 113 points or 0.4% at 29,303. The S&P 500 index was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.

Sentiment was supported somewhat by the release of the Empire State Manufacturing index, which rose by more than expected to its highest level since May last year.
Among the biggest gainers was Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, which rose 12.6% to a new record high of $32.20. It’s now tripled since its IPO last year, and has doubled since the middle of January, when fears about the Covid-19 outbreak began to weigh on the broader market.
The company hasn’t released any financials in that time, suggesting that the rally is in large part stoked by speculative interest looking for a growth story to rival Tesla .
Tesla  stock was up another 7.0%, approaching the peak of last week’s spike, helped by a Reuters report that it is in talks with China’s CATL to use cobalt-free batteries in the cars made at its new factory in Shanghai.
Theoretically, taking cobalt out of the value chain could cut production costs. However, Reuters also cited a source as saying it has no plans to abandon the use of its current nickel-cobalt-aluminum battery technology.
Elsewhere, Franklin Resources  stock rose 7.6% and Legg Mason stock rose 23.6% after the two companies agreed to combine in a deal that values the latter at around $4.5 billion. 
Oil and gas stocks again came under pressure after U.S. crude futures snapped their winning streak, losing 0.9% to $51.83 a barrel amidst lingering concerns about the travel restrictions still in force in China, and Russia’s refusal – so far – to sign up to deeper production cuts along with OPEC."

Investing.com - Tesla  was climbing again Tuesday after   Morgan Stanley    predicted a 50% jump in shares in its most optimistic scenario, while Bernstein bumped up its projection of where the stock is headed.
Shares of the electric automaker rose 6.4%.

While  Morgan Stanley   is still skeptical about Tesla in its base case (considered the default view comparable with other Wall Street banks), in its bullish case it sees shares running up to $1,200 per share.

“Our new bull case reflects 4 million units of auto volume by 2030 with a 12% operating margin,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jones said in a note. “This compares with our base case forecast of 2.2 million units and a 10% OP margin by 2030.”
In its base case, Morgan maintained its underweight rating, with shares falling to $500 per share, citing unfavorable risk/reward, although that’s up from its previous base target of $360.
Also today, Bernstein raised its price target on the stock to $730 from $325, keeping its market preform rating, calling it the “ultimate possibility stock”.
Analysts Toni Sacconaghi wrote that even if Tesla’s market share drops by 50%, its compound annual growth rate can still be 15% for 20 years."

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – Wall Street fell Tuesday on fresh worries about the impact of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak on global growth after Apple  warned that the virus would stall iPhone demand and production in China.

The S&P 500 fell 0.48%, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.20% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.72%.

Apple said it will miss its fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance range of $63 billion to $67 billion, sending its shares more than 2% lower.

Some on Wall Street, however, maintained their optimism on Apple amid expectations the impact on revenue will likely be temporary.

""We assume that, as with every other company operating in China, the situation on the ground continues to evolve for Apple. We are reducing our forecasts for both the March and June quarters, but we see this as a temporary issue for Apple ,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note

Still, revenue warning raised fears about the performance of the tech giant s supply chain disruptions, with chipmakers in particular coming under pressure.

Broadcom , Skyworks  and Micron  fell more than 1%, keeping the broader tech sector in the red.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, led the decline in Wall Street, paced by a fall in oil prices amid lingering fears about the virus  impact on Chinese oil demand.
Beyond virus jitters, the final wave of earnings also garnered investor attention.

Walmart  climbed nearly 1% after shrugging off weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results, which it blamed on softer-than-expected performance over the holidays.

  Advance Auto Parts    reported earnings that topped consensus estimates, sending its share about 7% higher.

Elsewhere, Tesla  resumed its run higher, rising about 6%, after analysts on Wall Street raised their price targets on the electric automaker.

Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Tesla  to $500 from $360 (and to $1,200 for its bull case) and Bernstein upped its price target to $730 from $325.

Shares of the company backed by billionaire Richard Branson have taken off in popularity among individual investors in recent sessions, nearly displacing Tesla Inc , another favorite among non-professional investors.
Virgin Galactic was the third most traded stock on Fidelity s online brokerage in recent sessions, with two thirds of clients buying shares, rather than selling. Orders for Virgin Galactic on Fidelity trailed only Apple Inc  and Tesla.

Virgin Galactic is racing against SpaceX and Amazon  CEO Jeff Bezos  Blue Origin to bring tourists into space, but is the only one of the three whose shares are publicly listed. That makes Virgin Galactic the only option for stock market investors who want to buy into the emerging business of space travel.
 Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas, who has an ""overweight"" rating on Virgin Galactic, cautioned in a note on Tuesday that the recent surge has been ""driven by forces beyond fundamental factors.""
""We are very constructive on the Virgin Galactic story ... We just think the share price could use a breather,"" Jonas wrote, maintaining his $22 price target.
Virgin Galactic has over 600 reservations and $80 million in deposits for 90 minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket.
The shares received a boost last week after Virgin Atlantic moved its SpaceShipTwo vessel to its operational base in New Mexico. Attached to its carrier aircraft, VSS Unity was flown from its manufacturing facility in California.
The move to ""Spaceport America,"" a purpose-built commercial spaceport, lets it begin final stages of test flights, according to Virgin Galactic.
The hypersonic surge in Virgin Galactic follows a recent rally in Tesla shares, another stock wildly popular among non-professional investors. Fueled by improved profitability, the electric carmaker s stock has surged over 150% since early December, including a 6% rise on Tuesday.

The financing Tesla lined up from local banks last year may have allowed the carmaker to delay recognition of capital expenditures, Chris McNally, who rates Tesla shares the equivalent of a sell, said in a Feb. 14 report. The Evercore analyst said the arrangements also probably help explain how Tesla spent just $1.3 billion on capex last year, a little over half its budget for as much as $2.5 billion.
“It’s possible that TSLA’s Shanghai factory and extremely limited capex may be what the SEC is looking into,” McNally wrote. Representatives for Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, and Judy Burns, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing last week that the SEC sent the company a subpoena on Dec. 4 seeking information on “certain financial data and contracts including Tesla’s regular financing arrangements.” In the same filing, the company said that much of the investment in its factory near Shanghai “has been and is expected to continue to be provided through local debt financing.”
Tesla disclosed in December that it had lined up 11.25 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in financing from local banks for the plant, which started producing Model 3 sedans late last year.
“We are supplementing such financing with limited direct capital expenditures by us, at a lower cost per unit of production capacity than that of Model 3 production at the Fremont factory,” Tesla said last week in its 10-K, referring to its higher-cost assembly plant in California."

Investing.com -- Apple s sales warning is a dim memory as risk assets march higher, along with gold, on expectations that central banks will pick up the pieces if the coronavirus does hit the world economy badly. Five Federal Reserve officials  speeches today will test that thesis. Mike Bloomberg makes his debut in the Democratic Party debate this evening, and crude hit a three-week high ahead of the release of private estimates of U.S. oil stocks later. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, February 19th.
1. Melt Up; Gold touches 7-year high

After a sell-off that lasted almost 24 hours, markets are back in risk-on mode, convinced that the economic impact from the Covid-19 outbreak will be brief and manageable, and equally convinced that global central banks will support markets at current levels even if it isn’t. Turkey s cut its key rate for a sixth time in a row Wednesday, by a larger-than-expected 50 basis points.

Indicators of excess flashing red include a seven-year high for gold futures at $1,613.95, and another 7.4% rise in futures on Palladium, as portfolio investors pile into a supply squeeze caused by production issues in South Africa and a surge in demand from the automotive industry, its biggest user.
That comes against the backdrop of another surge in Tesla  stock after analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target by 27% to $928, citing the outlook for its energy generation and storage businesses. That means that Wall Street now has at least one analyst supporting the optimism of Tesla’s notoriously bullish retail investor base.
2. Fed speeches, minutes to provide reality check

The thesis of central banks coming to rescue will be tested in the course of the day as a succession of Federal Reserve officials step up to the microphone. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester is first up at 8:30 AM along with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. They’re followed by Minnesota Fed President Neal Kashkari at 11:45 AM and Dallas’ Robert Kaplan at 1:30 PM.  Richmond’s Thomas Barkin rounds off the procession at 4:30 PM.

The more backward-looking publication of minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting will also be out at 2 PM ET.

There’s also January data for housing starts and building permits, as well as January’s producer price inflation numbers. 

3. Stocks march higher, shrug off Apple s warning
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher after shrugging off Apple’s warning that it would miss its first-quarter sales target due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

By 6:40 AM ET (1140 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was up 59 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq 100 contract was up 0.3%.
Overnight, the Stoxx 600 in Europe hit a new record high but Chinese stock indices were mixed, as official data showed the official death toll hitting 2,000, and the number of confirmed cases topping 75,000.
Coincident economic data continue to show a mixed picture, with less than three-quarters of Macau’s casinos taking advantage of the right to reopen on Thursday, deeper cuts to refining runs at refineries, and extensive pay cuts and arrears at Chinese companies.
4. Bloomberg makes his campaign debut
Mike Bloomberg takes the stage with other candidates for the Democratic Party nomination for the first time in a televised debate at 8 PM ET (0100 GMT on Thursday).

The billionaire ex-Republican mayor of New York launched a media blitz earlier this week, but has yet to be challenged seriously either by voters or by the other candidates, who are sure to target him tonight. Bloomberg’s campaign said on Wednesday he would sell his financial information company – valued by some at around $60 billion – if elected.
The debate comes ahead of next week’s primary in Nevada, which arguably represents ex-Vice President Joe Biden’s last chance of resurrecting his campaign, and which also tests the ability of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, to garner support among the Latino and African-American communities, a factor seen as crucial to their chances of defeating Donald Trump in November.
5. Oil hits three-week high ahead of API.

Crude oil futures are extending their recovery. By 6:40 AM ET, they were up $53.02 a barrel, near their highest in three weeks.

The American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly estimate of U.S. supplies of crude and refined products at 4:30 PM, against a backdrop of expectations for an increase of 3.77 million barrels in crude inventories.

Investing.com -- Wall Street returned to risk-on mode at the opening of trade on Wednesday, shrugging off the growth concerns triggered by Apple’s warning over the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.
Stronger-than-expected data from the housing market in January continued to support sentiment, while the market was largely unconcerned by a sharp rise in producer prices that drove annual factory gate inflation to its highest level since May.

By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 91 points, or 0.3%, to stand at 29,323 points. The S&P 500 index was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.

Apple  rose 0.6%, making good around one-third of the losses that it made on Tuesday after warning that it wouldn’t meet its revenue target of $63 to $67 billion in the first three months of this year.

Hydrogen fuel cell company   Plug Power    continued to ride a wave of hot money flowing into alternative energy stocks, rising 4.6%, while Virgin Galactic  continued its parabolic trajectory, also fueled overwhelmingly by retail investors in search of the next big thing. 

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has an “overweight” rating on Virgin Galactic, cautioned in a note on Tuesday that the recent surge has been “driven by forces beyond fundamental factors.”

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq rallied to record highs on Wednesday as reports of a slight decline in Covid-19 cases and hopes for additional stimulus from China prompted investors to resume their bullish bets on stocks.

The S&P 500 rose 0.62%, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.01% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.53%.

China reported 1,749 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the lowest number of newly-confirmed cases since Jan. 29, stoking investor optimism that the spread of the virus was slowing.

Also adding to the positive backdrop on Wall Street, Bloomberg reported that Beijing was considering cash injections or mergers to bail out airlines hit by the virus.
Tech powered the broader rally in stocks, led by a 1.7% rise in Apple  as easing virus jitters gave credence to bullish calls from analysts, many of whom had downplayed the tech giant s warning that it will miss second-quarter revenue guidance.
Chip stocks also welcomed a wave of buying, with Nvidia leading the charge higher following a bullish note on the chipmaker from Wall Street.

Bernstein upgraded its rating on Nvidia  to outperform from market perform and hiked its price target on the company to $360 per share from $300 per share, sending its shares to an all-time high, up 5%.
The return of risk appetite triggered selling in U.S. government bonds, sending prices lower and yields higher, pushing bank stocks higher.
JPMorgan , Bank of America  and Goldman Sachs  rose more than 1% as a rise in bond yields tends to boost net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.

With investor hopes growing that efforts to control the virus are gathering pace, oil prices found their footing, triggering a rebound in energy stocks following a selloff a day earlier.  
On the earnings front, investors had to contend with mixed quarterly results.
Garmin  surged 8% after its fourth-quarter results topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Blue Apron  reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell well short of consensus estimates, sending its shares down more than 19%.

Investing.com - Virgin Galactic Holdings  flew past another milestone Wednesday in its other-worldly rally of 2020.
Shares of the private spaceflight company jumped another 17% to $35.45. The stock is now up more than 200% year to date.
Virgin Galactic soared 27.4% on Tuesday as the momentum money continues to pour into shares.
Tomorrow could be another catalyst for the stock as CEO George Whitesides presents at the   Barclays    Industrial Select Conference in Miami. The presentation will come before the opening bell.
Virgin Galactic is racing against Tesla  CEO Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Amazon  CEO Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin to bring tourists into space, but is the only one of the three whose shares are publicly listed. That makes Virgin Galactic the only option for stock market investors who want to buy into the emerging business of space travel.
Virgin Galactic has over 600 reservations and $80 million in deposits for 90-minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket.
The shares received a boost last week after Virgin Atlantic moved its SpaceShipTwo vessel to its operational base in New Mexico. Attached to its carrier aircraft, VSS Unity was flown from its manufacturing facility in California.
The move to “Spaceport America,” a purpose-built commercial spaceport, lets it begin final stages of test flights, according to Virgin Galactic."

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Wednesday on hopes of fresh stimulus from Beijing to curb the coronavirus impact, which is showing signs of slowing in China.

The S&P 500 rose 0.47%, the Nasdaq Composite surged 0.87% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.40%.

China reported 1,749 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, marking the lowest number of newly confirmed cases since Jan. 29 and the second-straight day infections have remained under 2,000.

The update arrived as the Bank of China hinted at fresh stimulus to fend off the impact of the virus, with reports suggesting that easing may be delivered as soon as Thursday.

""The fundamentals of China s economy have not changed,"" the People s Bank of China said. ""China s economy, however, also faces several challenges but will fend off major financial risks.""

Easing Covid-19 fears triggered a wave of green across energy stocks amid a climb in oil prices, setting up the broader market for a record day.

In tech, chip stocks rallied strongly as investors bet that supply chain disruption would be limited after China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reportedly vowed to help businesses that were impacted.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed 2.6% higher, led by a 6% rise in Nvidia .

Bernstein upgraded its rating on Nvidia to outperform from market perform and hiked its price target on the company to $360 per share from $300 per share, sending its shares to an all-time high.

Tesla  also supported the rally after Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock to $928 from $729, sending the electric automaker s shares up 6.9%.

Apple , meanwhile, clawed back the bulk of losses from a day earlier, when it warned on revenue on concerns that the virus would hurt iPhone demand and production. Shares closed up 1.45%.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street s newest cult stock appears to be Richard Branson s Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc , as investors drive shares of the space tourism company to sky-high levels and short sellers dig in their heels.
Virgin Galactic jumped 23% during Wednesday s session, adding to a rally that has seen the money-losing company surge over 400% since early December. After hours, it added another 5%.
That hypersonic ascent has made it a favorite among short sellers betting the shares will eventually fall back to earth, drawing comparisons to Tesla Inc , which has also surged in recent months.
""I’m calling it Tesla Junior because it s showing all the signs of becoming a cult stock on the long and on the short side,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Like other so-called cult stocks, interest in Tesla and Virgin Galactic is driven by speculation about big future payoffs rather than fundamentals.
The value of short bets against Virgin Galactic hit a record $500 million on Tuesday after the stock surged to its own all-time high, according to Dusaniwsky. The company s rally this year has cost short sellers $345 million in paper losses.
Virgin Galactic is racing against SpaceX and Amazon.com Inc  CEO Jeff Bezos  Blue Origin to bring tourists into space, but is the only one of the three whose shares are publicly listed. That makes Virgin Galactic the only option for stock market investors who want to buy into the emerging business of space travel.
Traders on Wednesday paid the equivalent of a 34% annual interest rate to borrow Virgin Galactic shares to make new short bets, reflecting a shortage in the shares due to its popularity among short sellers. Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, expecting to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference after paying the stock lender interest.
Underscoring retail investors  interest Virgin Galactic, the company was the second most traded stock on Fidelity s online brokerage in recent sessions, with two-thirds of clients buying shares, rather than selling. Orders for Virgin Galactic on Fidelity trailed only Tesla.
Helped by improved profitability, Tesla has seen its stock surge 120% this year, including a 7% jump on Wednesday. 

Traders are shorting $18 billion worth of Tesla s shares, dwarfing overall short bets against Virgin Galactic. Those bets are equivalent to 15% of Tesla s float, while short bets against Virgin Galactic are equivalent to 31% of the company s stock float, up from 7% in November."

China may extend subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases beyond this year in an effort to revive sales in the world’s biggest market, people familiar with the matter said.
Policy makers have been discussing the possibility after China’s first annual decline in sales of new energy vehicles, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The fall-off in demand came after the government trimmed subsidies for buyers last July to help streamline the industry and make it less reliant on state support. Though the talks predate the emergence of the coronavirus as a global threat, the outbreak has piled more pressure on the auto industry by causing production halts and keeping people away from showrooms.
Talks are at a preliminary stage and there is no guarantee the subsidies will be extended, the people said. As things stand, they are still set to be phased out at the end of 2020.
Prolonging the handouts would be beneficial to local EV makers such as BYD Co., BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co. and NIO Inc. as well as the likes of Tesla  Inc., which last month started deliveries from its new Shanghai factory, its first outside the U.S.
Sales of new energy vehicles including electric cars, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars tumbled 54% in January from a year earlier and the wider auto market also shrank, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Those figures were largely before the coronavirus outbreak took hold and led to city-wide lockdowns and production halts.
China introduced EV subsidies a decade ago and they played a key role in turning the country into the top market globally. They initially lopped as much as 60,000 yuan ($8,700) from a vehicle’s price tag, not including any extra sometimes provided by municipal governments. Subsidies now lower a vehicle’s cost by as much as 25,000 yuan, depending on the driving range.
The government set a timetable about four years ago to phase out subsidies by the end of this year. It also introduced a credit system that essentially required all carmakers -- international and domestic -- to produce at least some EVs. NEV sales accounted for about 8% of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.’s total last year.
It is unclear when the subsidies will be rolled back if they are extended beyond this year, the people said. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology didn’t respond to a fax seeking comment, instead referring to remarks by Minister Miao Wei last month, when he said the government will study and review the policy. He didn’t elaborate. The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planner, referred queries to the Ministry of Finance, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."

By Geoffrey Smith 

Investing.com -- Wall Street opened in a cautious mood on Thursday as optimism over containment of the Covid-19 virus in China was offset by signs of it spreading elsewhere in Asia, notably in South Korea, where the number of recorded cases doubled overnight.

By 10:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 points, effectively flat, as was the S&P 500. The Nasdaq 100 was down 0.1%.

Among the biggest movers was online brokerage E-Trade , which rose 24.2% after the company agreed to be bought by   Morgan Stanley   .

Morgan Stanley stock was down 4.1%, as market participants looked askance at the $13 billion price tag, thinking that the rapid consolidation of the retail brokerage sector ought to have strengthened its bargaining hand.

There were further extreme gains for Virgin Galactic  and hydrogen fuel cell maker   Plug Power   , as the flood of retail investors into both stocks continued to outweigh short positioning. Reuters reported on Wednesday that nearly one-third of Virgin Galactic’s free float was now shorted, but it still managed another 5.7% gain in early trading. Plug Power added another 2.6%.

Joining the party was online marketplace Fiverr , which rose 11% to its highest since last June’s rocky float. JPMorgan  analysts upgraded the stock earlier to overweight with a target price of $37, according to wire reports. That implies another 11% upside potential even after the morning’s move.

Newmont Goldcorp  rose 4.9% to an eight-year high after the company raised its dividend by 79%, offering further cost cuts and disposals to free up cash even as the price of the gold it mines hits a seven-year high.

Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks drew little comfort from the bounce in U.S. crude prices, with   Exxon Mobil   ,   Chevron    and ConocoPhillips  all edging down. By contrast Williams  rose 4.6% to its highest in four weeks after posting stronger-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.
Tesla  stock meanwhile pulled back 1% after extraordinary gains in recent sessions. A report that China may extend subsidies for electric vehicles beyond this year went largely overlooked."

The court said in a statement it had rejected urgent applications to stop the land being cleared of trees from several environmental groups, adding its ruling was final. It had temporarily halted the tree felling earlier this month.
The U.S. electric carmaker announced plans last November to build a Gigafactory in Gruenheide in the eastern state of Brandenburg that surrounds Berlin, a decision that was initially lauded as a vote of confidence in Germany.
However, local and national lawmakers were caught out by the strength of opposition to the Gigafactory, with hundreds of demonstrators protesting over what they say is the threat it poses to local wildlife and water supplies."

Other carmakers like Tesla , BMW  and Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) have also started to promote products heavily online in recent weeks as the health crisis escalated and authorities warned people to stay away from public places.
Consumers can order and customize their cars on Geely s website, it said in a statement. It will also offer test drives where potential consumers will be able to arrange a drive starting from their home address in coordination with local dealerships.
The coronavirus has killed 2,236 people and stricken more than 75,400 in mainland China, and strict public health measures
to contain its spread have severely disrupted business and consumer activity.
Sales of passenger cars in China, the world s largest auto market, plunged 92% in the first 16 days of February compared with the same period a year earlier, data from one industry group showed.
Victor Yang, a senior official at Geely, told Reuters promoting online sales will allow automakers to directly reach customers through sales and marketing and help them build experience should they want to continue to do so in future.
Geely, which is China s most globally-known automaker thanks to its investment in Volvo and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), said that car production in February is around one-third of its usual monthly output, but around 90% of workers will return to work by the end of this month, Yang said, adding the automaker has bought facial masks for workers and dealers.
Geely has partnered with third-party online sales platforms including Tmall , JD.com  and Suning.com (SZ:002024) in the past but it is the first time the Zhejiang-based automaker is selling cars through its website. Tesla, which is building cars from its $2 billion factory in Shanghai, has been promoting online sales for years."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian technology start-up Cognitive Pilot, which makes components for driverless vehicles, is considering an initial public offering (IPO) after 2023, its chief executive told Reuters.
The company has already attracted investment from top Russian lender Sberbank, which has bought a 30% stake, though it gave no indication on a valuation of the business.
Cognitive Pilot develops components for self-driving cars as well as autonomous control systems for agricultural machinery, trains and trams. It lists state rail operator Russian Railways, farming conglomerate Rusagro and South Korean auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis among its clients.
""The first IPOs in this sector will be highly successful. It s important not to sleep through the moment,"" Chief Executive Olga Uskova said.
""So if before we weren t even thinking about an IPO, now we really are considering it.""
After 2023 Cognitive Pilot will either launch an IPO or announce a new round of investment, Uskova added.
With large tech companies and automakers developing and testing autonomous vehicles, including Russia s Yandex and Google parent Alphabet , Cognitive Pilot is looking to increase capacity and mass-produce its technologies.
However, it is likely to face strong competition from leading carmakers such as General Motors , Toyota and Tesla , which are working on developing in-house technology for autonomous vehicle systems.
In the first half of this year Cognitive Pilot plans to open offices in China, the United States and Brazil, where it has several agricultural clients."

""Tree clearance is proceeding in an orderly manner,"" Tesla said on Friday. There were no environmentalists holding up the process, Tesla s spokeswoman Kathrin Schira said in a statement.
The U.S. electric carmaker last November said it will build a factory in Gruenheide in the eastern state of Brandenburg near Berlin, creating up to 12,000 jobs, a decision that was initially lauded as a vote of confidence in Germany.
Tesla wants to start production in 2021, but environmentalists have exploited legal loopholes in the planning process to halt felling of trees until an environmental audit is finalised to gauge whether any rare species could be endangered. 
A local court on Thursday stepped in and rejected environmentalist efforts to stop the land being cleared of trees, adding its ruling could not be appealed.
The court s decision was welcomed on Friday by Germany s industry association BDI and economy minister Peter Altmaier. 
""It s an important signal,"" Altmaier said on the sidelines of an event in Lithuania. 
Lawmakers from Germany s pro-business Christian Democrat and Free Democrat parties had warned that the legal battle waged against the Gigafactory would inflict serious damage on Germany s image as a place to do business.
Activists from a group calling themselves the ""Tree pirates"" with the motto ""Up with trees, down with capitalism"" on Friday said it had occupied the forest to prevent Tesla from building its plant. 

""The factory is here mainly to build sports utility vehicles,"" the group said in a statement on Friday. ""Snob cars which kill people."" "

The Dow dove 905.27 points, or 3.12%, to 28,087.04 at 9:35 AM ET (14:35 GMT) and the S&P 500 fell 93.63, or 2.8%, to 3,245.62. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 341.72, or 3.6%, 9,234.87, with tech stocks particularly hard hit.
The U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted the most since October and the 10-Year yield fell below 1.37%. Its all-time low is 1.32% hit in 2016 after the Brexit vote.
Worries snowballed over the weekend as the numbers of cases of Covid-19 jumped in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Authorities in Italy imposed a quarantine in the north of the country and its benchmark MIB index tumbled nearly 6%.
The Covid-19 shock is a test of the fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) and buy-the-dip conditioning that has helped stocks overcome the headwinds of valuations, Allianz  Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.
“A key element is whether markets distinguish between Central Banks  willingness (high) and ability (low) to counter the economic shock,” he said.

Havens including Treasuries and gold surged.
In a dramatic day across markets, these were some of the standout moves:

“Stock markets around the world are beginning to price in what bond markets have been telling us for weeks -- that global growth is likely to be impacted in a meaningful way due to fears of the coronavirus,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.
Governments and companies are curbing travel and trade in an attempt to contain a novel pathogen that can be transmitted by people without symptoms. Today’s market moves follow on last week’s surge into havens after fresh warnings by companies over the potential impact of the virus on business and global supply chains. Adding to the anxiety Monday was China announcing an easing of the quarantine of Wuhan, only to retract the statement hours later.
“Markets hate uncertainty and the coronavirus represents the most uncertain macro risk markets have faced in years,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. “Investors are also acutely aware that many misjudged the economic severity of the virus early on, making them more open to entertaining worst-case scenarios now.”
Elsewhere, Italian bonds dropped on concern that the spread of the coronavirus may push the economy into a recession. The Australian dollar weakened to an 11-year low and the offshore yuan held most of last week’s decline.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board will hold a public hearing on Tuesday to establish the probable cause of a fatal March 2018 Tesla  Autopilot crash in California and will issue a series of safety recommendations, two people briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The safety board is expected to issue recommendations to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla and a California transportation agency, the sources said.
The NTSB issued recommendations after other Tesla Autopilot crashes and planned to reiterate some of the guidance. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The NTSB and NHTSA did not comment ahead of the 1 p.m. meeting.
There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.
Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using the driver assistance system Autopilot, but the company advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention.
The NTSB, which criticized Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, also found in September the system’s design permitted a ""driver to disengage from the driving task"" in a January 2018 California crash.
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple  software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Mountain View, California, in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier known as a ""crash attenuator.""
In September, the NTSB said California should ensure timely repairs of highway traffic safety equipment. California had failed to repair the attenuator after a crash 11 days before the one involving Huang. The attenuator is designed to absorb crash forces before a vehicle hits a concrete median barrier.
Caltrans spokesman Matt Rocco said on Monday the agency ""is implementing several steps to enhance monitoring and tracking of the repair of damage to highway infrastructure."" The efforts include ""enhanced reporting on the timely repair of high priority traffic safety devices.""
The NTSB said earlier that Huang’s hands were not detected on the steering wheel in the final six seconds before the fatal crash. There was no evidence of braking or evasive action. Huang also reported that on prior trips, the car steered away from the highway requiring his intervention, the NTSB said.
The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and logs recovered show a word-building game was active during Huang’s fatal trip."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday sharply criticized Tesla  Inc. s lack of system safeguards in a fatal 2018 Autopilot crash in California and called U.S. regulators  approach in overseeing the driver assistance systems ""misguided.""
NTSB board members questioned Tesla s design of its semi-automated driving assistance system and condemned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for a ""hands-off approach"" to regulating the increasingly popular systems.
NHTSA has ""taken a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety"" and should ""complete a further evaluation of the Tesla Autopilot system to ensure the deployed technology does not pose an unreasonable safety risk,"" NTSB said.
The board faulted Apple Inc  and other smartphone makers for refusing to disable devices when users are driving. It also called on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to use its authority to take action ""against ""employers who fail to address the hazards of distracted driving.""
The board s criticism posed a direct challenge to the auto industry’s efforts to profit from partially automated vehicles and the smartphone industry’s quest to keep user eyes on their devices.
The NTSB can only make recommendations, while NHTSA regulates U.S. vehicles. NHTSA has sent teams to investigate 14 Tesla crashes in which Autopilot is suspected of being in use, but taken no action against the company.
Concerns have grown about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.
""It s time to stop enabling drivers in any partially automated vehicle to pretend that they have driverless cars. Because they don t have driverless cars,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.
The Mountain View, California crash - involving a driver who was playing a game on his phone during the fatal trip - illustrates ""semi-autonomous vehicles can lead drivers to be complacent... and it also points out that smartphones manipulating them, can be so addictive, that people aren t going to put them down,"" Sumwalt added.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and recovered logs showed a word-building game was active.
The probable cause of Huang s crash was Autopilot steering the vehicle off the highway ""due to system limitations, and the driver’s lack of response due to distraction likely from a cell phone game application and overreliance"" on Autopilot, the NTSB said. Huang on prior trips had intervened when Autopilot steered the vehicle toward the same ""highway gore"" area. 
NHTSA said it will carefully review the NTSB s recommendations. The agency added that commercial motor vehicles ""require the human driver to be in control at all times.""
Tesla drivers are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, but Tesla advises keeping hands on the wheel and paying attention.
Sumwalt said Tesla allowed drivers to remove their hands from the wheel for up to three minutes under certain conditions when using Autopilot. 
The NTSB said Tesla added safeguards to require quicker warnings at higher speeds for drivers without hands on the wheel.
Regulators in Europe place limitations on Autopilot use and Tesla issues alerts there for hands-off driving within 15 seconds, the NTSB said.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg called Autopilot ""completely inadequate"" and noted Tesla vehicles have repeatedly crashed into large obstacles. 
Sumwalt said Tesla - unlike five other auto manufacturers - has ignored NTSB safety recommendations issued in 2017.
Tesla s Autopilot is tied to at least three deadly crashes since 2016 and suspected in others.
The NTSB will release in coming days the probable cause of a third Tesla Autopilot fatal crash in March 2019 in Florida that showed no evidence the driver’s hands were on the steering wheel in the final 8 seconds before striking a semi-trailer truck.
The NTSB also called on cellphone manufacturers to add more safeguards to prevent the misuse of devices by drivers.

Sumwalt noted that Apple does not have a distracted driving policy, but said it should have one. Apple says it expects its employees to follow the law."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - SpaceX, the private rocket company of high tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, won final approval on Tuesday to build a research and manufacturing plant for its deep-space Starship project on a tract of vacant land at the Port of Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles City Council granted a permit for the facility by a unanimous 12-0 vote, paving the way for Musk, also the founder of Tesla Inc  electric car company, to proceed with an accelerated development of a new spacecraft and rocket system designed to carry humans to the moon and Mars.
The L.A. Board of Harbor Commissioners gave its go-ahead to the 10-year permit last week.
""It s crazy that here we are in 2020 preparing ourselves to send people to Mars, and it s going to happen in our backyard,"" Councilman Joe Buscaino, whose district includes the port, said before Tuesday s vote. ""We are becoming a spaceport.""
Operations at the facility will actually be confined to research, design and fabrication of aerospace components. Space vehicles built there are not permitted for launch but will be transported out of the port complex by barge or ship.
The council action clears the way for SpaceX to begin leasing 12.5 acres (5 hectares) of property on Terminal Island for its Starship plant at a starting rent of $1.7 million a year, with an option to expand its site to 19 acres.
The company, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies, has an option to terminate the permit within 180 days. 
SpaceX secured a similar permit two years ago, but canceled it and moved its initial phase of the Starship project to Texas, where the company has developed and tested an early prototype dubbed Starhopper.
The Los Angeles Port site will bring further Starship development closer to SpaceX s headquarters in the L.A. suburb of Hawthorne, where it has manufactured its workhorse Falcon 9 rockets and Dragon crew capsules.
The future facility, which may incorporate renovations to abandoned warehouse and workshop structures on the site, is expected to provide 130 new jobs, according to Musk. 
As designed, the Starship itself is actually the top half of a colossal interplanetary rocket system that will stand 387 feet (118 meters) tall and be capable of ferrying dozens of humans to the moon and Mars in a single launch.

Musk has said that he hopes the Starship will be ready for its first orbital test flight later this year."

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Autonomous driving firm Pony.ai said on Wednesday it has raised $462 million in its latest funding round, led by an investment by Japan s largest automaker Toyota Motor Corp. 
Toyota invested around $400 million in the round, Pony.ai said in a statement, marking its biggest investment in an autonomous driving company with a Chinese background. 
The latest fundraising values the three-year-old firm, already backed by Sequoia Capital China and Beijing Kunlun Tech Co, at slightly more than $3 billion. 
Reuters reported the funding earlier on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The sources added that some of Pony.ai s existing investors had joined the financing, but did not specify names.
The investment by Toyota comes at a time when global car makers, technology firms, start-ups and investors - including Tesla , Alphabet  Inc s Waymo and Uber  - are pouring capital into developing self-driving vehicles. 
Over the past two years, 323 deals related to autonomous cars raised a total of $14.6 billion worldwide, according to data provider PitchBook, even amid concerns about the technology given its high cost and complexity. 
The Silicon Valley-based startup Pony.ai - co-founded by CEO James Peng, a former executive at China s Baidu , and chief technology officer Lou Tiancheng, a former Google and Baidu engineer - is already testing autonomous vehicles in California, Beijing and Guangzhou.
The firm is focusing on achieving ""Level 4"", or fully autonomous standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention.
The latest funding will support Pony.ai s future robotaxi operations and technology development, one of the sources said.
Pony.ai, which has partnerships with automakers Hyundai and GAC, said it will explore ""further possibilities on mobility services"" with Toyota.
Pony.ai is not the first time that Toyota, which sold more than 10 million cars globally last year, has invested in firms focused on autonomous driving and mobility services. 
Its autonomous vehicle partnerships include a venture with SoftBank Corp and an investment in robotaxi developer Uber ATG. Last year, it invested $600 million in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and a new joint venture to develop mobility services.
However the Japanese car maker, which has researched into autonomous driving technologies mostly through in-house engineers and this year will launch its first vehicle with autonomous highway driving capabilities, has been lagging rivals in bringing self-driving cars to market.

It has taken a long view toward the technology, saying it will take decades for cars to drive themselves on roads."

By Alex Ho
Investing.com - Japanese electronics company Panasonic Corp (T:6752) is ending its partnership with Tesla Inc  to produce solar cells, according to a Nikkei report on Wednesday. 
 
The decision was part of Panasonic’s plan to cut costs by closing underutilized production lines, according to the report. 
 
“Both companies agree that solar cell output there is unlikely to increase, and they no longer see a need to continue joint production,” Nikkei said in the report.
 
The two firms announced their joint venture on solar cells in 2016, according to Nikkei, which noted that they will continue working together on automotive batteries for Tesla’s electric cars.

TOKYO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp (T:6752) said it would exit solar cell production at Tesla Inc s New York plant, the latest sign of strain in a partnership where Panasonic s status as the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker s exclusive battery supplier is ending.
The move increases uncertainty over Tesla s  solar business which is already under scrutiny, having been drastically scaled back since the U.S. firm bought it for $2.6 billion in 2016.
Tesla has informed New York that Panasonic s withdrawal ""has no bearing on Tesla s current operations"", the state said in a statement. The company employs over 1,500 jobs in the city of Buffalo, clearing its 1,460 commitment before April - and thereby avoiding a $41 million penalty - the state said.
Panasonic said in a statement on Wednesday that it would cease production by the end of May and exit the factory by the end of September.
The withdrawal comes as Panasonic scrambles to divest of unprofitable businesses as its strategic shift to components from consumer electronics struggles to drive profit growth.
It is also another sign of a fraying partnership with the U.S. EV maker, which is set to diversify its battery supplies to include South Korea s LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) and China s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750).
Panasonic said it would continue its automotive battery joint venture with Tesla in the U.S. state of Nevada, which just reported its first quarterly profit after years of production problems and delays.
In the solar business, low demand from Tesla has left Panasonic sending most of the cells it makes in Buffalo to overseas clients, instead of selling them to Tesla for its trademark Solar Roof - cells designed to resemble regular roof tiles - as initially intended.
When announcing the solar partnership in 2016, Panasonic said it would invest over 30 billion yen ($271.96 million) in the Buffalo plant. Tesla s long-term purchase commitment was part of the deal.
Panasonic, which employs about 380 workers at the plant, said that the U.S. partner ""hopes to hire as many qualified Panasonic applicants as possible to help fill job openings for its growing operations in Buffalo.""
The latest decision will have no significant impact on Panasonic s annual profit forecasts, according to a company spokeswoman.
Panasonic has already shrunk its own solar business elsewhere as it contends with competition from cheaper Asian rivals, selling its solar panel plant in Malaysia and research arm to China s GS-Solar for an undisclosed amount last year."

The Greater China region, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, created 182 new billionaires in the year to Jan. 31, taking its total to 799, according to the 2020 Hurun Global Rich List released on Wednesday. That compares with 59 new U.S. billionaires.
While the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has hammered the world s second-biggest economy, it has also driven up stock valuations of Chinese companies in online education, online games and vaccinations, the report said.
With much of China stuck at home due to quarantines and travel restrictions, demand for online services has surged, lining the pockets of billionaire founders such as Robin Li of Baidu , owner of popular online video platform iQiyi. 
Healthcare entrepreneurs specializing in vaccinations did well, including An Kang of Hualan Biological Engineering (SZ:002007) and Jiang Rensheng of Zhifei Biological Products (SZ:300122).
""China today has more billionaires than the U.S. and India combined,"" said Rupert Hoogewerf, founder and chairman of the Hurun Report, which counted 629 U.S. billionaires and 137 in India.
New Chinese entrants include Cheng Xianfeng of drug maker Yifan Xinfu Pharmaceutical (SZ:002019) and Shen Ya of online discount retailer Vipshop . 
In the past year to end-January, tech stocks in China  surged 77% and Chinese pharma companies  gained 37%, beating a 16% rise in world stocks (MIWD00000PUS).
""A boom in tech valuations and strong stockmarkets across the U.S., India and China propelled the billionaires to record heights,"" said the British accountant, who began publishing the list in 1999.
U.S. tycoons still led the list, with Amazon.com  founder Jeff Bezos retaining the top spot for a third year with a $140 billion fortune. 
Jack Ma of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group  topped China s billionaires with $45 billion and came in No. 21 overall, but he was overtaken by Elon Musk from Tesla  due to soaring shares in the U.S. electric carmaker.
Technology was followed by property, manufacturing, capital and retail as a major source of wealth in the past year.
Despite the U.S.-China trade war, Ren Zhengfei, founder of Shenzhen-based telecoms giant Huwei Technologies, blacklisted by the U.S. government, saw his personal wealth grow 7% to $3 billion, roughly on par with that of U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Beijing is the world s billionaire capital for the fifth year, with 110 billionaires, against 98 in New York. Shanghai overtook Hong Kong to claim third spot."

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A surge in small-cap Chinese stocks, fueled by government stimulus measures to support the virus-hit economy, is triggering fears of a repeat of the boom that preceded the 2015 market crash.
China has injected massive funds into the banking system, cut interest rates and encouraged lenders to extend cheap loans to limit the financial fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, which has hit businesses hard, from retailers to manufacturers.
Shenzhen s tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext (CNT) has jumped 13.1% this month through Wednesday, far outpacing the 1.7% gain in China s blue-chip CSI 300 index (CSI300).
A broader index of tech shares  including start-ups and more established names such as ZTE (SZ:000063) has gained 14%.
""This is already a bubble. It s a game of the greater fool,"" said Shen Shikai, an investor who has been managing money pooled from his friends for over a decade.
""The economy has stalled for two months, and companies  first-quarter earnings will be ugly. Why on earth are stocks trading at such a level?""
ChiNext is trading at 59 times last year s earnings, up from roughly 30 a year ago and 47 at end-2019. In New York, the Nasdaq is trading at 26.5 times trailing earnings, according to Refinitiv data. Fan Huang, head of wealth management at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) (China) Ltd, said the central bank s monetary easing was ""directly contributing to investors  speculative activities.""
In a Feb. 24 blog post, he urged investors not to forget the lessons of the 2015 market meltdown. That crash wiped more than $5 trillion in capitalisation off the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, with ChiNext losing half its value within months.
Li Shoushuang, a capital markets lawyer at Dentons, called on the government to cool the market by introducing capital gains tax on share trading - something Beijing has always avoided.
""China s stock market is not a barometer of economic health. Rather, it s a barometer of liquidity,"" he said.
TECH FEVER
Some investors, however, believe the rally has solid footing, based in large part on Beijing s drive to make China more technologically self-sufficient as it battles the United States over trade.
Others are also pointing to an expected innovation boom in 5G, the fifth-generation wireless technology.
""If you look through the lens of China s great economic transformation over the next 3-10 years, you ll realize we re just at the starting point of a big bull (market),"" said Wen Xunneng, a Shanghai-base hedge fund manager. ""Don t fight the trend."" Adding to the fervour, mutual fund managers have been aggressively pitching tech-focused products.
Hwabao WP Fund Management Co s flagship technology ETF (SS:515000) has seen its assets under management nearly double this year to over 14 billion yuan ($2 billion).
Huang Yue, fund manager at Guotai Fund Management Co, was promoting products via an online roadshow on Tuesday that invest in the semiconductor, telecommunication, and computer industries.
""It s true that valuation of chip stocks is near historic highs. But we also expect to see a big jump in earnings.""
FROTH Bubble believers have pointed to particular share jumps as signs that markets have grown too frothy.
Shares in  Jiangsu Xiuqiang Glasswork Co  (SZ:300160) have tripled this month on speculation that the glass maker will enter into a tie-up with Tesla . The company says it s unaware of any factors that pushed up its stock.
Last week, cleaning robot maker Beijing Roborock Technology  jumped 85% in its STAR Market debut after an initial price offering (IPO) oversubscribed more than 3,000 times.
""With all the millions and millions of Chinese on lock-down, more people have more time to dabble in the stock markets,"" said Grizelda Lee, head of discretionary portfolio management, Asia, Indosuez Wealth Management, referring to strict public health measures to contain the virus.
Daily trading volume in Shenzhen (SZSC) - home to many smaller firms - hit an all-time high on Tuesday, surpassing that of blue-chip and large-cap heavy Shanghai market.
Rocky Fan, economist at Sealand Securities, said regulators appeared to be tolerating speculation as a booming market will help already-listed companies raise fresh funds.
He cautioned against calling it a bubble, however, saying lower interest rates were also making stocks more attractive.

Tesla Inc.  shares fell after China registration data indicated a significant sequential slowdown in demand before the electric-car maker started feeling the brunt of any impact from the coronavirus.
Registrations of new Tesla cars plunged 46% to 3,563 in January from December, according to state-backed China Automotive Information Net, which gathers industry data based on insurance purchases. Of the January registrations, 2,605 were for cars built in China.
While Tesla had bucked the trend in China’s waning electric-car market in the previous two months, the January drop shows that the U.S. brand isn’t immune to challenges the broader industry is facing. China’s car market probably is headed for a third straight annual decline as the coronavirus outbreak exacerbates a slump started by an economic slowdown and trade tensions.
Tesla shares dropped as much as 6.3% before the start of regular trading. The stock had soared 86% this year through the close Wednesday, partly driven by optimism about the company starting to produce Model 3 sedans at a newly built plant near Shanghai.
In total, deliveries of new-energy vehicles in China from carmakers to dealerships tumbled 54% last month, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry body.
Tesla began delivering locally built Model 3s to customers in China last month, seeking to boost volumes amid rising competition from the likes of BMW AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), which are also bringing out new electric cars. The sedans assembled domestically qualify for tax exemptions and subsidies the company has missed out on in the past.
The locally manufactured models helped Tesla’s January registrations increase from just 853 a year earlier.
The timing of China’s Lunar New Year complicates year-over-year comparisons in the first months of 2020. The holiday fell in January this year and in February in 2019.
But business has ground to a halt this month due to the coronavirus, and automakers are expected to come up well short of last year’s sales levels in February. Deliveries to dealers this month are set to slide about 75%, resulting in about a 40% drop in the first two months of 2020, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Data from LMC Automotive showed that 3,563 Tesla vehicles were registered in China in January, up from 853 vehicles a year earlier, but down from the 6,613 vehicles registered in December.
Tesla registrations fluctuate significantly from month to month, LMC data showed. The automaker typically delivers many more vehicles in the final month of a quarter than in the first month. In October 2019, Tesla owners registered just 763 vehicles, LMC data showed.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
The selloff in Tesla shares highlights the growing concern about the health of the Chinese auto market as the government and companies contend with the disruption of the coronavirus outbreak.
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers had earlier said https://in.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos/china-auto-sales-likely-tumbled-18-in-january-coronavirus-seen-taking-heavy-toll-idINKBN2070K3 that overall vehicle sales fell by almost a fifth in January, hurt by Lunar New Year holidays that started earlier than last year and by the coronavirus disruptions.
The electric-car maker said https://in.reuters.com/article/china-health-shanghai/shanghai-to-help-tesla-resume-production-amid-coronavirus-spread-idINKCN202060 earlier this month that the outbreak would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars in China.

By Geoffrey Smith 

Investing.com -- Panic selling continued in the U.S. stock market on Friday, putting the market on course for its biggest weekly loss since 2008 amid growing signs that the coronavirus outbreak will ultimately cause an economic shock in Western economies as well as in China and its Asian trading partners. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened with another loss of 627 points, or 2.6%, taking it below the 25,000 mark. By 10:33 AM ET (1533 GMT), the DJIA was down 4%, or 1,034 points.
The S&P 500 was down 3.4%, at its lowest since October 2019. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, fell 2.7%. 

Overnight, another sharp jump in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Korea and Iran, coupled with new emergency virus containment measures in Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere, all contributed to keeping the mood negative. A better-than-expected monthly rise of 0.6% in U.S. personal income in January was of little consolation.
""The landscape remains very uncertain,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management in a weekly note. ""For now, there is a sense with the coronavirus that things will need to get worse before they can get better.""
He argued that the point of ""maximum bearishness"" could be another couple of weeks away. 
""This could coincide with the moment that Covid19 is officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization,"" something that could lay the groundwork for a coordinated response of policy stimulus, Dowding argued. Such hopes seem far away at the moment, with the U.S. and German governments both playing down the seriousness of the situation.

The bond market is now betting heavily on the Federal Reserve riding to the rescue. The2-Year Treasury bond yield dipped below 1% overnight and then roared lower to 0.91% after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard indicated that the Fed, if not fiscal policy, would react to a global pandemic.  
“Further policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time,” Bullard, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said Friday in prepared remarks to be delivered in Fort Smith, Arkansas.
Hot money continued to flood out of Tesla , which lost another 7.1%, taking its losses for the week to over 30%.

Beyond Meat  suffered similar problems following a surprise quarterly loss after the bell Thursday, losing 17.6%. It’s now down 25% for the week.

Apple  was also the subject of some heavy profit-taking, falling 5.1% to its lowest since December.  None of the companies mentioned released any news of note.

One stock emphatically bucking the trend was   Zoom Video Communications   , the maker of software for video conference calls. Zoom Video stock has been flying as participants price in a boom in such calls as Covid-19 spawns a global outbreak of working from home and restrictions on business travel."

(Reuters) - Autopilot, Super Cruise and Drive Pilot are different names given to technology that automates steering and braking in a growing number of vehicles, but none of it can safely ""pilot"" cars without regular human intervention. 
These systems and the potential for consumers to misunderstand and misuse them are putting pressure on regulators everywhere to overhaul safety testing and consumer rating systems that have not kept up with the pace of deployment of new semi-automated driving technology.
That may be especially true in the United States, where the National Transportation Safety Board chided regulators this week for lagging their European counterparts in efforts to ensure consumer and road safety.
The acting head of the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said on Wednesday that his agency would make changes this year to a testing program that assigns safety grades to new and future vehicles.
""We’re raising the bar for safety technologies in our new vehicles,"" said acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief James Owens. 
NHTSA in December 2015 issued proposed rulemaking for testing procedures that would be similar to more comprehensive testing done by European regulators.
No rules have been put forward since then, however, and Owens  comments came a day after the NTSB sharply criticized NHTSA for its hands off approach to overseeing semi-automated driving technology. The NTSB, an independent U.S. government agency, also compared NHTSA s testing and ratings unfavorably to consumer safety systems put in place by European agencies.[nL1N2AP0SD]
Surveys have shown that consumers overestimate the capabilities of semi-automated systems, as automakers race to deliver on the promise of truly driverless cars. Safety advocates also criticize manufacturers for using misleading terms to market those systems, including Autopilot, Pro Pilot Assist and Traffic Jam Pilot.
European regulators have been expanding their rules and ratings to evaluate new technology such as automatic braking and lane-keeping, while U.S. regulators have done little to change their traditional ""five star"" crash test grading system.
European safety ratings assess all advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) currently available and regulators have passed some laws on the technology.
In 2018, European Union regulators required the installation of acoustic and visual warning signals for lane-keeping systems every 15 seconds if drivers take their hands off the wheel.
As a result, Tesla  had to issue a software update to its Autopilot system in the EU.
A regulatory body is currently working on rules for more advanced hands-off systems that can control braking, acceleration and lane changes at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph).
Under draft EU rules, carmakers among other things need to show how the system safely hands control back to the driver, how the car monitors the road and how it reacts in emergency situations.
Pressure on automakers in Europe also comes from non-binding performance ratings by Europe s New Car Assessment Program, known in the industry as Euro NCAP.
Euro NCAP began rating automatic braking systems in 2014. It is testing the performance of advanced cruise control, lane-centering systems and blind spot detection since 2018 and beginning in May will also grade how well a car s system is keeping the driver engaged.
The group is a non-governmental body but funded by some EU countries and also receives money from national motor clubs and insurers. Matthew Avery, a Euro NCAP board member, said the group was sharing testing methods with NHTSA and the NTSB on a regular basis.
As regulation moves slowly, Euro NCAP plays a crucial role in holding carmakers accountable, Avery said.
""The manufacturers initially scream blue murder and say our targets are impossible to achieve, but then one of them does it and everyone follows,"" he said.
Carmakers in the United States are allowed to self-certify that their vehicles comply with existing rules, said University of South Carolina law professor Bryant Walker Smith, who focuses on automated driving. But there are currently no rules for ADAS.

NHTSA also publishes an annual New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which evaluates the crashworthiness of a vehicle and outlines what semi-automated features a car comes with. But the agency does not assess the safety of those systems despite nearly all modern cars being equipped with some features like automatic emergency braking."

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has amassed a stake in  Twitter Inc   and is pushing for changes, including removal of the social media company s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Twitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott.
Twitter shares fell last year when the company disclosed that its platform experienced glitches that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners. The San Francisco-based company s reluctance to expand beyond its core platform has also left it with limited scale compared to its larger social media peers.
Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, will be seeking to install its own nominees to Twitter s eight-member board when three of the company s directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, the sources said.
It is not clear who Elliott would like Dorsey replaced with and how big its stake in Twitter is. The New York-based hedge fund has more than $40 billion in assets under management, and has targeted companies in recent months ranging from eBay Inc  to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).

Dorsey, 43, is one of Silicon Valley s most prominent entrepreneurs, and also runs  Square Inc  , a mobile payments company he co-founded.
While investors have tolerated this arrangement since 2015, when Dorsey became Twitter s CEO for the second time, his announcement in November that he would like to move to Africa for up to six months raised questions among analysts about his management.
Dorsey, who helped conceive Twitter in 2006, first served as CEO until 2008, when he was replaced by one of his co-founders Ev Williams . Williams had accused Dorsey of being a poor manager and not focusing enough on Twitter s profitability.
Dorsey returned as interim CEO after his predecessor Dick Costolo stepped down. Dorsey s knowledge of the company and quick launch of new products convinced Twitter s board to hand him the reins on a permanent basis a few months later."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets should fall further on Monday after a record contraction in China s manufacturing and service sectors because of the coronavirus outbreak, illustrating the massive potential economic impacts of the epidemic for the rest of the globe.
The outbreak has already caused massive disruptions in industry, led U.S. equities to suffer their worst weekly selloff since the financial crisis and knocked trillions off the market value of global stocks.
The first proper glimpse of how much economic damage the outbreak has inflicted so far came from China, the world s second-largest economy where the epidemic began.
China s official Purchasing Managers  Index (PMI), a widely-watched measure of economic activity, fell to a record low in February, data showed on Saturday, with a worrying collapse in domestic and export orders and a contraction of the country s burgeoning service sector.
Investors believe the next few days will reveal whether the outbreak is accelerating in the United States, the world s biggest economy, how much the U.S. government is prepared to deal with an epidemic, and the economic damage in other countries. 
""Right now the market is saying that this is unbounded. We don t know what the limits are and we don t know where it s going to peak,"" said Graham Tanaka, chief investment officer at New York-based Tanaka Capital.
Stock markets globally lost about $5 trillion of value last week, as measured by the MSCI all-country index (MIWD00000PUS) that comprises stocks across 23 developed and 26 emerging markets.
The S&P 500 (SPX) shed 11% last week, entering correction territory, while the Dow (DJI) and the Nasdaq (IXIC) also registered their deepest weekly percentage losses since October 2008.

The February China PMI readings are the first snapshot of the economy s state since the start of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed almost 3,000 people in mainland China and infected about 80,000.
The data indicates the economic disruption from the virus could extend to the whole first quarter of 2020 since the outbreak has caused widespread transport curbs and required tough public health measures that have paralyzed economic activity.
Capital Economics estimates China s economy would contract outright in year-on-year terms this quarter, the first time since at least the 1990s.
""The worst China manufacturing PMI in history will shock the market on Monday,"" ING economists wrote.
""Covid-19 has not only stopped production but has also broken the supply chain of production,...."" they said.
Investors are looking to the United States, where the outbreak and efforts to prepare for its possible spread have become political during a presidential election year.
The White House has played down the crisis and described the high level of news coverage as a ploy to hurt President Donald Trump s efforts to secure a second term.
""The next line in the sand is if we see cases expand in the U.S.,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager and strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.
Signs that Japan could cancel its 2020 Summer Olympics--after years of preparation and some $12 billion in investment--would be another unwelcome development, Janasiewicz said. 
The International Olympic Committee has said it is committed to holding the Games on schedule.
Tanaka, of Tanaka Capital, said he is closely watching the U.S. response, including whether the government has been able to secure more kits to test for the virus. 
He has trimmed his position in shares of Tesla Inc  and sold all his energy sector holdings as crude prices plummeted. But he continues to hold airline stocks JetBlue Airways Corp  and  Alaska Air  Group Inc  despite concerns about travel demand."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors targeting declines in U.S. stocks saw sizeable gains during last week s sell-off, as markets plunged on concerns that the spread of the coronavirus was accelerating beyond China.
Short sellers - who hope to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price - logged a one-week paper profit of $104.77 billion in the last week of February, according to data from financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners measuring bets against U.S.-listed stocks and American Depositary Receipts. That compares with $3.25 billion in paper profits in the prior week.
That upside came during a week marked by furious selling of everything from stocks to a broad range of currencies and eventually, some popular safe-haven assets like gold. All three major U.S. indexes registered their largest weekly declines since 2008, with the S&P 500 (SPX) falling 11.5%.
The tumble in stocks has marked a long-awaited reversal for bearish investors, many of whom had seen their portfolios bruised by the market  relentless march higher last year, when the S&P gained 29%. The S&P was up 2.7% on Monday.
Though few, if any, could have named the coronavirus as a major threat to markets going into 2020, short sellers have long railed against stock valuations they perceived as being out of line with fundamentals and other excesses that have cropped up during the more than decade-long bull market.
""The run-up in the last fall was ridiculous. And there was a lot of cheerleading going on,"" said Brad Lamensdorf, a portfolio manager at Ranger Alternative Management.
His fund s short position has dropped to about 85% after Lamensdorf took profits on various bets against stocks, from being short 99% of his portfolio going into the year, he said.
The week s declines afforded Andrew Left of Citron Capital the opportunity to profitably close a long-held bet against online retailer Wayfair  on Friday. It was a position he had maintained for four years.
Wayfair shares dropped 21% last week amid the broad market selloff.
The sell-off has also helped Left profit from a bet against Tesla Inc s  shares. The electric car company s shares, which had more than doubled in price this year through Feb 21, fell 26% last week.
Yet the markets have not entirely spared Left s portfolio, which also includes long positions, or bets on certain stocks to move higher.
""My shorts have gone down, which is nice. My longs have gone down, which is not so nice,"" Left said. ""What I am hoping is that when the market does stabilize, at whatever level, my longs will be more resilient.""
The market tumble is also likely to be a boon for ""black swan"" funds - hedge funds that position themselves for big market dislocations sparked by unforeseen events.
""Risk management is not about timing, it is about contingency planning. Our clients were extremely well prepared,"" Mark Spitznagel, the founder of Universa Investments, said in a statement.
Among its strategies, the firm uses far out-of-the-money ""put"" options on individual stocks and broader markets, designed to explode in value when markets experience a sharp fall.
The window for short-selling gains may be a small one. Historically, big market drops have more often been brief, violent events that have been followed by rebounds.
The S&P 500 has notched weekly declines of 10% or more only 14 times in its history, and those drops have been followed by an average weekly gain of 3.5%, data from Bespoke Investment showed.
It is a fact that s not lost on short sellers like Lamensdorf."

Dorsey and Musk have lauded each other on social media earlier. In an event early this year, Dorsey had asked  Musk, who has over 31 million followers on Twitter, for advice on how to make the platform better.

Already known as a big fan of DOGE, Musk has made yet another endorsement for the cryptocurrency in a March 3 tweet.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor  Co is putting more chips on a bet that it can profit from selling electric vans to delivery businesses that need to reduce carbon emissions.
Ford will roll out an all-electric version of its Transit van for North America in model year 2022, mirroring the timetable for launching a similar model for the European market, the company said on Tuesday in conjunction with the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis.
""Our electric bet as a company is different than our competitors,"" Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said in an interview. ""The most critical bet we will be making over the next several years will be our commercial vehicles.""
Two of three electric vehicles Ford has announced as part of an $11.5 billion investment in electrification through 2022 are aimed at commercial customers - the Transit and an electric version of the company s best-selling model, the F-150 pickup.
Ford s Mustang Mach-E electric SUV represents a low-volume challenge to electric luxury vehicle market leader Tesla  Inc.
The electric Transit and F-150 will play in market segments Ford dominates in the United States and Europe.
""Half of the vehicles doing work in the U.S. are  Ford Motor Co  vehicles,"" Farley said. Ford is also the No. 1 commercial vehicle brand in Europe, and has led the commercial van market in Britain, which is Europe s largest, for 55 years.
Regulators in Europe and in some U.S. cities are stepping up pressure on businesses to replace diesel or gasoline-fueled delivery vans with electric models to reduce pollution in city centers.
In the United States, Amazon.com Inc , has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from start-up Rivian, the first of which will be delivered in 2021 and built in Normal, Illinois. Ford has a separate partnership with Rivian.
The electric Transit will not be related to the Rivian van, said Ted Cannis, Ford s director of electrification.
The new Transit will be an early test of the company s efforts to deploy new connectivity technology and services to go with it, Farley said.
Ford said the electric Transit will be built in America and cost more than the gasoline-powered version, which starts at $34,500. Research firm Auto Forecast Solutions said it will be built in Kansas City, Missouri, along with the gasoline version."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co  executives on Wednesday will tackle one of their toughest tasks: Persuading investors that a Detroit automaker can catch up with Elon Musk and Tesla Inc  as vehicles go electric.
Even as global markets reel from coronavirus fears, Tesla s valuation is outpacing that of GM and most other legacy automakers. On Tuesday, Tesla s market cap hovered around $144 billion, more than three times GM s $45 billion.
GM is by far the larger manufacturer by volume, and generates more cash and profits. But in the electric vehicle market, Tesla is the leader.
Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 electric vehicles globally, including 223,000 in the United States. GM sold just 16,400 Chevrolet Bolt EVs to U.S. buyers, and 60,000 Baojun E-Series models in China with joint venture partner SAIC Motor (SS:600104).
GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss have ramped up electric vehicle development over the past three years, focusing on a proprietary battery, a low-cost flexible vehicle design and a blueprint for high-volume production, mainly in China.
The company has revealed its electric vehicle strategy in incremental steps - announcing the Hummer brand will be reborn as an electric pickup and partnering with Korean battery maker LG Chem (KS:051910) to build a $2.3 billion battery plant near a shuttered GM car plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM is now trying to put the broader picture into focus for investors.
GM has said it aims to reduce the cost of battery cells - the single greatest expense in electric vehicles - to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour. That in turn could slash the cost of battery packs for electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV by up to 45%, experts say.
GM is also developing an advanced battery, in partnership with LG Chem and Japan s Honda Motor Co (T:7267), that will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.
Musk has told investors that Tesla has battery cost and range breakthroughs in the works that it will describe at a ""Battery Day"" in April.
Barra has said GM plans to spend more on electric vehicles than on gasoline-powered cars over the next five years. But it has not put a figure on how much it will invest in its efforts to rival Tesla and traditional competitors such as Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) or  Ford Motor Co   as the electric vehicle market develops.
Barra has, however, promised that GM will make money on electric cars by 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uncertainty over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak has prompted at least some winners of the U.S. Lipper Fund Awards to look for companies that can withstand a prolonged pullback. 
U.S. stocks are down sharply from the record highs they reached in late February as companies ranging from Apple Inc  to Tesla Inc  warn investors their supply chains and revenues could be derailed by the rapidly spreading virus known as COVID-19. 
As a result, fund managers from firms including  Wells Fargo  , GMO, Madison Investors and Needham & Company say they are looking at companies in the healthcare, technology and financial services sectors which could continue to gain market share regardless of any economic disruptions from the outbreak.
""We felt that we were due for a correction, we just didn t know what would trigger it, and when it would begin,"" said Chris Retzler, portfolio manager of the Needham Small Cap Growth fund. 
""I don t know how low we go and how long we stay there, but I still remain firmly of the belief that we are in a bull market,"" said Retzler, adding that he was actively adding to companies during the market sell-off.
Retzler is focusing his portfolio on companies that can benefit from the growth of 5G communications, military modernization and data security, among other areas.
He also remains bullish on healthcare companies, which saw share prices decline earlier this year on concerns that Bernie Sanders, a self-avowed democratic socialist senator from Vermont, could win the Democratic presidential nomination and push a Medicare for All plan. 
""We have healthcare investments where we think that names are misunderstood, and we think the opportunities are great but are taking a little bit longer to excite investors,"" Retzler said. 
Mike Smith, portfolio manager of the Wells Fargo Endeavor Select fund, said he reserves a portion of his portfolio to focus on companies with compelling valuations and has been more active in the last week about adding to healthcare and technology names. 
Among the more recent additions to his portfolio is  DexCom  Inc , a medical device company that makes continuous monitoring devices for patients with diabetes. Shares of the company are up nearly 32% for the year to date through March 5, while the broad S&P 500 is down slightly more than 5% over the same time. 
""We re trying to find those companies that are impervious to what s going on right now,"" Smith said. 
Matt Hayner, portfolio manager of the Madison Investors fund, began buying shares of Becton Dickinson and Co , a maker of medical supplies and devices, in January. The company, whose shares have dropped about 11% year to date, now represents about 4% of Hayner s portfolio.
""Even in the face of economic disruption, people will still need healthcare and maybe even more so with a disease traversing the globe that ultimately hospitalizes people,"" he said. 
NEW  QUALITY  STOCKS
The annual Lipper Fund Awards granted by Refinitiv, formerly the financial and risk business of Thomson Reuters, recognize the top funds and fund management firms in more than 20 countries based on risk-adjusted returns. Winners were announced on March 5 in New York. 
The market risks from the coronavirus outbreak should ""burn themselves out"" within the next two quarters, setting up a rebound in the shares of companies that have seen sharp declines, said Tom Hancock, portfolio manager of the GMO Quality fund. 
Hancock added a new position in a healthcare company to his portfolio last week and built up a new position in ride-hailing firm  Lyft  Inc  over the last two quarters after the company s ""broken"" initial public offering left its shares trading at an attractive valuation, he said. 
Hancock is now focused on companies that can grow regardless of the economic impact of the coronavirus, he said. 
""We still have concerns that are stopping us from going out and buying absolutely everything,"" Hancock said.
He said he was focusing on giant technology companies like Google-parent Alphabet Inc  and Apple Inc which have what he called ""natural monopolies."" Shares of both companies are down about 5% over the last month. 

""If you say high quality stocks, people think of names like Procter and Gamble and  Pfizer  ,"" Hancock said. ""But we think the new quality stocks are the technology stocks that have very low capital requirements and operate winner-take-all business models."""

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks tumbled again at the opening Friday as the number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus topped 100,000.
Investors fled equities and other risk assets with increasing urgency, pushing the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond down to an all-time low of 0.69% at one stage.
By 9:35 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 736 points or 2.8%. The S&P 500 was down 3.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.8%.
The Dow had already fallen by 970 points on Thursday.
The release of data showing the U.S. labor market in rude health in February was largely ignored, given that markets have put an increasingly narrow focus on the spread of the virus and the measures likely to be needed to contain it.  The economy added 273,000 jobs in February, far more than the 175,000 expected. January’s hiring was also revised up.
“Measures suspending travel, closing schools and enforcing temporary business closures and an increase in working from home all risk material economic disruption in the short term,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer with BlueBay Asset Management, in a weekly post. “With fear and some degree of panic driving sentiment, this can be further exacerbated, leading to a dangerous combination of both supply and demand shocks to the global economy.”
Data compiled by John Hopkins University showed that there are now 233 confirmed cases in the U.S., with 14 deaths recorded, of which 12 were in a single county in Washington state.
Earlier, President Donald Trump cancelled a planned visit to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The White House said in a statement that Trump, who has called the virus a “Democratic hoax” and repeatedly compared it a routine seasonal flu outbreak, “does not want to interfere with the CDC’s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency.""
Among individual stocks, JPMorgan  stock fell 6.3% after the bank confirmed that chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had had to undergo heart surgery. The bank will be run jointly by its two co-chief operating officers while Dimon recovers.
JPMorgan stock has already fallen some 17% over the past two weeks, along with many other bank stocks. High market volatility has led to the cancellation of many deals, while the Federal Reserve’s emergency interest rate cut will put fresh pressure on lending margins, allowing homeowners and consumers to refinance debt at lower levels.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc  plans to increase its production capacity for certain car parts at its $2 billion factory in China, according to a government document seen by Reuters, as it pushes to localize its supply chain in the world s biggest auto market.
The U.S. automaker, which started delivering Model 3 electric sedans from its Shanghai factory in December, plans to add lines to make more battery packs, electric motors, and motor controllers, according to the document submitted by Tesla to Shanghai government.
Tesla, which as of end-December used about 70% imported parts for the cars it made in China, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
But according to the document, Tesla wants to almost double its annual building capacity for cooling pipes, a key part in a car s heat management system, to 260,000 sets a year from 150,000. It did not provide capacity details for other parts.
The planned production line will not include battery cell manufacturing but will package out-sourced battery cells at the plant, the document said.
Tesla has previously said it wants to localize its entire supply chain in China by the end of this year.
The company is also building an additional stamping line to speed up car production in Shanghai, according to construction documents seen by Reuters.
The Shanghai factory is key to Tesla s growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later hike output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y, according to a Shanghai government filing in 2018.
The company aims to deliver more than 500,000 vehicles globally by end-2020."

The factory will build both the electric pickup and the Model Y crossover for customers on the East Coast, the chief executive officer wrote. He didn’t elaborate on which states Tesla is considering beyond saying Tesla will pick a location in the central U.S.
Musk unveiled the Cybertruck in November and positioned it as a radically different option for buyers of pickups, a highly lucrative segment dominated by Ford Motor  Co., General Motors Co . and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. A botched demo in which Tesla’s design chief cracked supposedly shatter-proof glass generated enormous buzz and prompted the company to sell T-shirts featuring the broken windows.
By publicizing Tesla’s plans to construct a factory for the truck slated for production late next year, Musk, 48, is repeating a strategy used in 2014 to score a $1.3 billion incentive package from Nevada. The state lured the company’s massive battery factory there after Musk held a bake-off in which Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas were the finalists that came up short.

States with right-to-work laws that prohibit unions from requiring prospective hires to join their membership are likely going to be contenders for Tesla’s facility, said John Boyd, principal of a manufacturing site-selection firm based in Princeton, New Jersey.
“I’d put Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, Texas and Michigan on the list,” Boyd said. “This will be a trophy project for the automotive sector.”
Government incentives will play a role in Tesla’s decision-making, along with logistics costs, access to big, talented workforces, and quality of life, Musk told the Wall Street Journal in an email. TechCrunch reported the company is in talks with officials in Nashville, Tennessee, citing a source familiar with the discussions.
Tesla fell 3% after the close Tuesday, though the late trading session ended before his tweets. The stock has surged 54% this year.
The likely battle between states will play out as U.S. President Donald Trump, who’s vowed to revive the American auto industry, probably will face off against Joe Biden, the vice president in the Obama administration, which backed General Motors and Chrysler through their 2009 bankruptcies.
Trump praised Musk in an interview with CNBC in January, calling the South Africa-born CEO “one of our great geniuses” and predicting he would build “a very big plant in the United States.”
Tesla recently completed construction of its newest plant in China and started delivering locally assembled Model 3 sedans to consumers in January. It’s also planning a factory near Berlin.

Last month, Musk hinted that Tesla could build a factory in Texas. The Texas Enterprise Fund, created by the state’s legislature under former Governor Rick Perry, has become one of the largest payers of economic-development incentives in the nation.
Texas offered $2.3 million to entice SpaceX, the rocket company Musk founded and runs, to locate a launch facility in Brownsville, on the Gulf Coast near the Mexican border. Tesla’s chip team is based both in Palo Alto, California, where the carmaker is headquartered, and in Austin, Texas.
The company’s sole U.S. auto-assembly plant is in Fremont, California, which makes the Model S, X and 3 and has begun producing the Model Y crossover."

No country in Europe has been hit harder by Covid-19 than Italy, which has over 10,000 registered cases and which announced a nationwide quarantine on Tuesday.
Reuters quoted a spokesman as saying that the closures will run from Wednesday through Saturday. After that, to allow greater spacing of employees at their workstations, ""daily production rates will be lowered to accommodate the adapted manufacturing processes,” the spokesman told Reuters.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Automakers in China are calling on the government to help after industry-wide sales plunged 79% in February to mark their biggest ever monthly decline, with demand pummelled by the coronavirus outbreak.
Their wish list includes cuts to the purchase tax on smaller vehicles, measures to support sales in rural markets and an easing of car emission requirements, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said.
February sales in the world s biggest auto market tumbled to 310,000 vehicles from a year earlier, falling for a 20th straight month.
""China s auto sales for February returned to levels not seen since 2005,"" said Chen Shihua, a senior association official.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-electric cars, contracted for an eighth month in a row, also hurt by a rollback in government subsidies.
CAAM said it is also calling for authorities to extend subsidies for new energy vehicles, ease restrictions on the number of consumers in big cities who purchase the eco-friendly cars and expand investment in infrastructure such as charging stations.
""The government will consider these proposals but it is unlikely they will launch so many policies,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.
""Measures like cuts to the purchase tax, support for rural markets and easing purchase restrictions on new energy vehicles are reasonable and would have an immediate impact,"" he said.
CAAM said auto sales will  definitely  rebound in March and should return to normal in the third quarter this year.
An association official told Reuters last month that auto sales are likely to drop by more than 10% for the first half of this year. If the outbreak in China is effectively contained before April, the decline could shrink to around 5% for the whole year, he added.
HUBEI 
The association has also asked authorities to improve logistics and support the resumption of production at factories in Hubei, the province where the outbreak began and a major car manufacturing hub responsible for nearly 10% of China s output.
 Dongfeng Motor Group  Co Ltd (HK:0489) and its partners Honda Motor (T:7267),  Renault  SA  and  Peugeot  SA  have all delayed the restart of production in Hubei.
However, after authorities in Hubei s capital Wuhan lifted restrictions on Wednesday for a few key industries and allowed some people to return to work, Honda resumed limited output at a car plant in the city.
Nissan Motor (T:7201) has also said it plans to partially resume production in Xiangyang, another city in Hubei, as well as its plant in Zhengzhou, Henan.
Outside of Hubei, Tesla s  production and delivery plans in Shanghai, have also been disrupted. 
A CAAM poll showed that production for China s automakers had returned on average to more than 40% of normal output levels.

A drop in auto sales this year would be the third year in a row of declines. Industry-wide auto sales fell 8.2% last year, pressured by new emission standards and trade tensions with the United States."

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Elon Musk is expected to defend a $2.2 billion deal in court next week criticized by shareholders as benefiting Musk at the expense of Tesla  Inc, and the outcome may depend as much on the chief executive s temperament as on the facts of the case. 
The electric vehicle maker s unconventional CEO has shown two sides in recent court proceedings -- one polite and respectful, the other evasive and taunting.
It remains to be seen which Musk will show up on Monday at a Delaware court, the nation s leader on corporate issues, when he squares off against union pension funds and asset managers who claim they were misled about the benefits of Tesla buying SolarCity in 2016 for $2.2 billion. 
Getting it wrong could cost Musk more than $1 billion.
“If you seem arrogant in court, you may be signing your own economic death warrant,"" said John Coffee, a securities professor at Columbia Law School.
This may be particularly true in Delaware s Court of Chancery, with roots in medieval England and known for its decorum.
Musk and his lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. 
Smashing corporate norms has come to define Musk, who has a cult-like following for his ambitious vision, battles with short-sellers and disdain for ""boring bonehead questions"" from analysts.
In the Delaware case, shareholders claim SolarCity, a rooftop solar energy company, was secretly on the brink of bankruptcy when Tesla purchased it. They argue the deal benefited Musk, SolarCity s largest shareholder, his cousins who co-founded the firm, and Tesla directors who owned stakes in SolarCity. 
Investors want Musk to surrender the 2.2 million shares of Tesla he received in the deal, which on Thursday were worth about $1.2 billion.
Musk has countered that Tesla s stock has tripled since the deal, demonstrating its value. SolarCity has withered because its staff were redirected toward launching the Model 3 sedan, a make-or-break product for Tesla, not because the solar business lacked value, according to Musk.
The Tesla directors who approved the deal settled allegations against themselves in January for $60 million, which was paid from insurance. They denied wrongdoing.
Musk has dug in his heels.
During a June deposition, Musk clashed with shareholder lawyer Randy Baron, calling him ""reprehensible,"" doubting his emotional well-being and avoiding many questions.
He went on tangents about Tesla s solar potential, lamented both the decline of U.S. manufacturing and the large size of the legal industry and asked Baron if he was only motivated by money. Baron declined to comment.
In contrast, at a defamation trial in December, Musk donned a dark suit, spoke softly on the witness stand, and apologized to the cave rescuer who sued Musk for calling him a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter. 
Musk portrayed himself as overworked, hounded by critics and earnest in his desire to help in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand.
The strategy appeared to pay off when a jury ruled in Musk s favor and rejected the $190 million claim against him.
The SolarCity case will be decided by Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights.
The court has its own cult-like following for its scholarly opinions that often run more than 100 pages and which have shaped Corporate America.
""The big question is when you get an institution like him and an institution like the Court of Chancery, is it oil and water or is it mutual respect?"" said Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Delaware Law School.
Executives often struggle with testimony because they think of themselves as the smartest in the room, according to University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Jill Fisch. 
""That works against them in depositions and is even worse in court. It tends to piss off a judge,"" said Fisch. 
David Murdock, the CEO of Dole Food Co Inc, went to Delaware to defend his 2013 buyout of the fruit company, and sunk himself with bizarre, rambling and combative testimony. He was ordered to pay former shareholders $148 million.

""By dint of his prodigious wealth and power, he has grown accustomed to deference,"" wrote the judge, Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, of Murdock. ""That habit serves a witness poorly when he faces a skilled cross-examiner."""

(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has begun to impact the U.S. court system, halting civil and criminal jury trials in high-profile venues such as Manhattan s federal court and delaying a $1 billion trial against Elon Musk that was slated to begin Monday.
The postponements are raising questions about how courts will protect criminal defendants  rights to a speedy trial, clear a backlog of hundreds of thousands of asylum cases and resolve high-profile corporate disputes.
""It s all happening at the speed of light,"" said Eric Tennen, a criminal defense lawyer in Massachusetts. ""It s just crazy. I don t know what s what anymore.""
Courts are taking piecemeal approaches to addressing the spread of the virus.
Federal and state courts from Massachusetts to Washington have postponed trials and grand jury proceedings or banned visitors from countries with large outbreaks. 
New York state s court system on Friday announced it would suspend new jury trials, though trials in progress will continue.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday said that it was restricting visitors ""out of concern for the health and safety"" of its employees.
A union representing federal immigration judges, who have a huge backlog of cases, on Thursday asked the Trump administration to suspend all mass scheduling hearings, which can draw hundreds of people from around the world to their courts daily.
""This is exactly the type of situation the White House, (Centers for Disease Control) and other public health authorities urge us to avoid,"" the judges union said in a letter to Justice Department. 
The immigration judges said they would continue to hear cases involving people in detention.
Matthew Galluzzo, a criminal defense lawyer in Manhattan, said he expected lawyers to seek bail for some clients if the situation dragged on. 
""A defendant has a right to speedy trial and we don t like the idea of someone waiting for their day in court,"" Galluzzo said. ""Thirty days in one thing but when it becomes 60 or 90 that s something else,"" he said. 
Organizations that represent defendants in New York have called for the release of prisoners who are older, pregnant or have respiratory conditions, and an end to detaining defendants for administrative reasons, such as missed court dates.
The outbreak is also impacting corporate litigation.
A $1 billion non-jury trial over Tesla  chief executive Elon Musk s purchase of SolarCity that was slated to begin in Delaware on Monday was postponed indefinitely.
""While I certainly would not characterize this trial, or any other trial, as  non-essential,  it is not expedited and no irreparable harm will flow from an adjournment,"" wrote Delaware Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights.
In Long Island, New York, a jury trial over billions of dollars of claims stemming from the opioid epidemic against drug companies including McKesson Corp , Johnson & Johnson  and CVS Health Corp  has been postponed.
Removing looming trial dates could ease pressure on parties to settle.
""One of the reasons matters resolve is because of deadlines. Deadlines foster settlement talks,"" said Florida lawyer Michael Elkins.

Investing.com – Tesla  has plunged about 50% since accelerating to record highs just a month ago, but one analyst on Wall Street says the dip is not worth buying as the automaker continues to sport a frothy valuation.
""At current levels, Tesla stock remains high enough that it takes very aggressive assumptions on its future auto business to justify its valuation on a (discounted cash flow) basis,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.
Sacconaghi stopped short of calling time on Tesla s bull run despite highlighting the near-term risk to automaker following the coronavirus-led impact to auto sales.
""We see more near-term risk to estimates at Tesla than most other IT hardware or growth tech names, but believe shorting Tesla on this basis is more a market/Covid-19 call than a stock call,"" he added.
The bearish call on Tesla arrived on a day when its share price plunged 18% after RBC Capital cut his price target on the company and flagged concerns about deliveries falling short of estimates.
RBC cuts its price target on Tesla to $380 from $530, on fears that constrained demand in the second quarter, may force the company to cut production. The bank expects Tesla to deliver 364,600 vehicles for 2020 and 572,100 for 2021, down from his prior estimates of 524,200 and 618,000, respectively."

By 10:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the DJIA had recovered a liltle to be at 20,134 points, down 54 points, or 0.3% on the day. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 1.6% albeit in choppy trading.
The moves came against a backdrop of reports suggesting further emergency measures from the Federal Reserve are possible in the near term. 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who voted against the emergency rate cut at the weekend, said she would support the reintroduction of Fed purchases of commercial paper - last seen during the 2009 financial crisis - if market liquidity continued to deteriorate. 
The Fed will conduct a $500 billion overnight repo operation later Tuesday. 
Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics warned that it was impossible to see a bottom to the market until the shape and scale of the U.S. fiscal response to the crisis becomes clearer.
""We don t know yet whether Congress will spend, say, 2% of GDP or 10%. We hope for the latter, but given that the very modest first-stage House bill has not yet passed the Senate, it s hard to be wildly optimistic just yet,"" chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients.

(Reuters) - Local California officials are evaluating if and how Tesla Inc  will be allowed to continue operating its main U.S. vehicle factory as the San Francisco Bay Area begins a three-week lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus.
A spokesman for California s Alameda County, where Tesla s Fremont factory is located, said on Tuesday the county was consulting its lawyers and health officials to evaluate the situation and provide an answer by the end of the day.
""Part of Tesla s operations might fall under an exemption in the (county s) order, but making cars and pumping them out at the end of the assembly line is another question,"" the spokesman said.
Several media outlets on Monday reported the factory would be allowed to remain open, but a spokesman for Alameda County on Tuesday said there was no definitive answer yet on how to keep workers safe. 
The spokesman said he was also looking to connect with a Tesla official on the matter.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the spokesman s remarks.
Tesla s sole U.S. auto factory in Alameda County employs more than 10,000 workers and had annualized production of slightly over 415,000 units by the fourth quarter. 
The county is one of six covered by a  shelter in place  order from regional authorities that limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.
So far, automakers and their suppliers have avoided government-mandated production shutdowns in the United States.

The California Department of Public Health said in a statement that more guidance would likely be issued in the days ahead, but did not provide further details.

Investing.com -- Markets fall back into risk-off mode as the signs of a global recession multiply. The dollar continues to climb as financial markets worldwide show increasing signs of stress. Tesla  will be in focus after Bay Area authorities squashed its efforts to keep its Fremont factory open during the lockdown, while BMW joined Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Fiat Chrysler in suspending production in Europe. Angela Merkel raised hopes of a jointly guaranteed eurozone safe asset, but sovereign spreads continue to widen ominously. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, March 18th.
1. Markets resume sell-off 
Global stock markets resumed their descent, afraid that government measures to support the economy still won’t be enough to avoid a sharp recession.
By 6:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), U.S. stock futures had given up most of the gains made by underlying cash indices on Tuesday.  Dow Jones 30 Futures were down 833 points or 4.0%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 3.7% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract down 4.5%.
In Europe, the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 4.6%, while in Asia overnight, the Nikkei and Chinese CSI 300 had both fallen 1.7%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 6.4%.
Signs of dysfunction in financial markets continue unabated, as the European Central Bank allotted $75.8 billion through an 84-day swap operation with eurozone banks – more than it ever did during the 2008/9 crisis. It also lent another $36 billion through a one-week facility.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose 15 basis points to 1.14%, while gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,509.02 an ounce.
2. The dollar is the ultimate risk-aversion measure
The biggest single indicator of risk aversion, and of stress in global financial markets, remains the price of the dollar (hence the massive demand for dollars at the ECB’s swap operation).
The index that measures the dollar against developed-market peers has risen over 4% against developed-market currencies in the last nine days, and hit a fresh two-year high overnight, thanks to sharp gains against commodity currencies such as the loonie, Aussie and kiwi.
It’s making even sharper gains against emerging currencies, hitting a fresh all-time high against the Brazilian real on Tuesday, and rising 3% against the ruble to a new four-year high in early European trading on Wednesday. The dollar’s also up 4% against the Mexican peso overnight, and up over 1% against the Turkish lira at a two-year high.
3. France gets its bazooka ready after Merkel flags talks on euro-bonds
France is due to announce an emergency budget in what is likely to be the latest in a series of fiscal bazookas to be fired at the Covid-19 pandemic.
Late on Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the hope that the crisis could lead to the euro zone issuing jointly-guaranteed bonds to finance the region’s response packages. That would be a major leap forward from the response to the sovereign debt crisis that began a decade ago.
However, eurozone sovereign spreads continued to widen on Wednesday, mindful that any such move would need the approval of parliaments that have become more sceptical, rather than less, toward such measures over the last few years. German 10-year bond yields rose to a two-month high of -0.27% on a combination of Merkel s comments and forced selling by portfolio investors to raise liquidity.
4. Biden nearly home and hosed
Former Vice President Joe Biden all-but wrapped up the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination with a clean sweep of primary victories in Florida, Arizona and Illinois.
The victories amped up the pressure on Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to drop out of the race. After the latest round of primaries, Biden has 1,147 delegates compared to Sanders 861. To be sure of victory, candidates need the support of 1,991 delegates at the national convention.
5. Tesla will have to shut its Fremont factory
Among many stocks likely to be pressured at the opening is Tesla.
Alameda County officials confirmed on Tuesday that the carmaker’s Fremont factory is not classified as an essential business and is therefore subject to the lockdown order issued by Bay Area authorities over the weekend."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open with hefty losses Wednesday, giving back Tuesday’s gains, with investors fearful that the proposed virus stimulus package will not be sufficient to assuage severe economic damage from a protracted economic slowdown.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 92 points, or 3.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 330 points, or 4.5%, while the Dow Jones 30  futures contract fell 833 points, or 4%. These contracts have been stopped limit down, which suggests the cash markets could open with even greater percentage losses.
Wall Street closed with strong gains Tuesday after the Trump administration assembled a $1.2 trillion stimulus plan, that would send cash to Americans within two weeks, and backstop airlines and other companies. 
However, to get this deal past skeptical Republican senators, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that the country’s unemployment rate could hit 20% if they failed to act on this rescue package and there was lasting economic damage.
More and more economists including those from Wall Street’s biggest banks have declared that the outbreak has already triggered a global recession. Goldman Sachs  Goldman Sachs, for example, forecast in a note Sunday that the U.S. economy will shrink 5% in the second quarter after a 0% gain in gross domestic product growth in the first three months of the year.

FREMONT, Calif. (Reuters) - Tesla  Inc s vehicle factory in California appeared to be operating normally on Wednesday despite an order by local officials to comply with a three-week lockdown in the San Francisco Bay Area to rein in the spread of coronavirus.
Thousands of cars were visible in the factory s employee parking lot in Fremont, California, and employees were going to work, Reuters witnesses said. Several 18-wheeler container trucks were seen pulling into the factory grounds, they said.
Alameda County, where the factory is based, is one of six covered by an order from regional officials to ""shelter in place,"" which limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons. 
The county sheriff s office on Tuesday afternoon said Tesla is not considered an essential business under that order and cannot continue to operate its factory normally. 
Tesla can only maintain minimum basic operations under the order, the sheriff s office said. Under the county s order, those include maintaining the value of inventory, ensuring security and processing payroll and employee benefits.
Tesla s Fremont facility, which is the company s sole U.S. auto factory, employs more than 10,000 workers and had an annualized production of slightly more than 415,000 units by the fourth quarter.
A spokesman for the sheriff s office on Wednesday said rumors on social media that it had sent officers to the Fremont plant were not true. He referred further questions to the local police department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The offices of Fremont mayor s and the Alameda County district where the factory is located did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Under Alameda County s lockdown order, which took effect on Tuesday, violating or failing to comply are misdemeanors punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. 
On Tuesday, a spokesman for the county sheriff s office declined to provide details on any enforcement measures the sheriff s office would take if Tesla defied the order. 

Prior to the sheriff s office s decision, Tesla told employees in an email that the company and its suppliers would continue operations supporting the manufacturing and delivery of vehicles, a person who had see the email told Reuters."

DETROIT (Reuters) - The Detroit Three automakers will shut down their U.S. plants to stop the spread of coronavirus, bowing to pressure from the union representing about 150,000 hourly workers at those facilities, industry officials said.
 Ford Motor Co  , General Motors Co  and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV   confirmed the decisions to shut U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico. 
The Detroit automakers  shares took a beating on Wednesday, with GM closing 17.3% lower, Ford off 10.2% and Fiat Chrysler shares ending 9.2% lower in New York. The carmakers  North American factories build their most profitable trucks and sport utility vehicles, such as Fiat Chrysler s Jeep Wrangler, GM s Chevrolet Silverado pickup and the Ford F-series truck line.
The actions come less than a day after the automakers and the United Auto Workers union agreed to keep plants running with reduced shifts and staffing, and more time allowed for cleaning.
But that deal was put aside on Wednesday morning after Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said it would shut its North American factories for six days because of a slump in demand, and a worker at a Ford assembly plant in Michigan tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Ford on Wednesday morning closed the final assembly building at its complex in Wayne, Michigan, where it builds the Ranger pickup truck and will assemble Bronco SUVs. 
Ford said it would close all its North American plants after Thursday evening s shifts through March 30 to thoroughly clean the factories in the United States, Canada and Mexico. GM s timetable was the same, while FCA s is through the end of March.
South Korea s  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) closed its Montgomery, Alabama, assembly plant on Wednesday morning after an employee there tested positive for COVID-19. There were no details on when it would reopen. Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said it would close its North American plants for two days next week.
The Detroit Three automakers have yet to issue profit warnings, but Germany s BMW  said on Wednesday its 2020 profit would be ""significantly lower"" than last year. FCA said it would update its financial guidance when it has greater visibility on the epidemic s impact on the market.
The pain could also be felt by the U.S. government, which would lose $2 billion in tax revenue if sales in the entire U.S. auto sector stopped for a week, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
United Auto Workers (UAW) union President Rory Gamble, who had previously called on the Detroit automakers to close their U.S. plants, in a Wednesday statement called shutdowns ""the prudent thing to do.""
""Recent developments in North America make it clear this is the right thing to do now,"" GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a separate statement.
Affected workers qualify for unemployment as well as supplemental pay from the automakers, the union said.
It was not clear whether the automakers would seek to substitute this shutdown for the one they typically take annually during the summer.
Meanwhile, other automakers in North America are still operating assembly plants, including BMW in Spartanburg, South Carolina; Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) in West Point, Georgia, and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) in Chattanooga, Tennessee. 

Tesla Inc  was operating its plant in Fremont, California, on Wednesday, despite a statement from local officials that the factory cannot continue to operate as the San Francisco Bay Area began a three-week lockdown."

On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it was in talks with China and others to help ramp up supplies of health equipment, while General Motors  and Ford Motor  said they were in talks with White House officials.
""We will make ventilators if there is a shortage,"" Musk said on Twitter, responding to a fan s suggestion that the billionaire repurpose a factory for the task.
The comment immediately drew hundreds of replies urging him to act.
""If, for whatever reason, you don t believe there currently is a shortage, by all estimates, there will be,"" said a social media user with the handle Internetchilla. ""Please help.""
The Trump administration on Tuesday urged U.S. construction companies to donate respirator masks to hospitals and healthcare providers fighting the virus, amid a nationwide shortage.
Companies such as Apple  supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) have refitted production lines to make masks and similar items after stores in many countries ran out and suppliers were overwhelmed by the spread of the virus.
An Italian start-up used a 3D printer to replicate respirator valves, saying it would hand them to hospitals for free. Italy is battling the world s worst outbreak outside China.
Last month, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD (SZ:002594) said it was making 5 million masks and about 300,000 bottles of hand sanitizers a day.
On Wednesday, Tesla agreed to reduce the number of active workers at its California vehicle factory, a county spokesman said, amid regional lockdowns to rein in the virus.
The company employs more than 10,000 workers at its sole U.S. auto factory in Fremont.
Musk is not the first chief executive to offer help with medical supplies on Twitter, however.

SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son offered a million free virus tests this month. A day later, following criticism that he risked overwhelming medical facilities, he offered to donate a million free masks."

(Reuters) - U.S. researchers, following the lead of scientists in other countries, have launched studies to see whether widely-available, low-cost generic drugs can be used to help treat the illness caused by the new coronavirus.
There are currently no vaccines or treatments for the highly-contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, so patients can only receive supportive care for now.
But a 1,500-person trial, led by the University of Minnesota, began this week to see whether malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Two other trials are studying the blood pressure drug losartan as a possible treatment for the disease.
The malaria drug, also being tested in China, Australia and France, was touted earlier this week by Tesla  Chief Executive Elon Musk, who recovered from malaria in 2000 after taking the medication.
Besides having a direct antiviral effect, hydroxychloroquine suppresses the production and release of proteins involved in the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.
""We are trying to leverage the science to see if we can do something in addition to minimizing contacts,"" said Dr. Jakub Tolar, dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School and vice president for clinical affairs. ""Results are likely in weeks, not months.""
Most people infected with the new coronavirus develop only mild flu-like symptoms, but around 20 percent can have more severe disease that can lead to pneumonia requiring hospitalization.
The fast-spreading virus, which emerged in China in December and is now in more than 150 countries, has infected more than 214,000 and killed over 8,700 people worldwide, including at least 145 in the United States. Experts say it could take a year or more to have a preventive vaccine ready, so effective treatments are desperately needed.
A French team on Tuesday said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo.
Tolar said he bought 1,500 doses of hydroxychloroquine for a ""laughable"" amount of money. ""We don t need a multibillion-dollar investment. It is part of the beauty of this approach,"" he said.
But he and others cautioned that people should not be using any prescription drugs without medical oversight.
""These treatments should be used only in hospitals by critical care specialists,"" said Dr. Russel Buhr, critical care pulmonologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Also this week, the University of Minnesota launched two trials testing losartan - one to measure whether the hypertension drug reduces the risk of organ failure for COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized, and another looking at whether the drug can limit the need for hospitalizations.
Losartan is an angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blocker, which researchers say could play a role in blocking an enzyme used by the virus to bind to cells.
Pharmaceutical companies are also working to develop treatments for COVID-19, including Gilead Sciences Inc s  experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients via intravenous infusion over several days.
The New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month described how the drug was successfully used on the first patient infected by the novel coronavirus in the United States.
Results from a remdesivir trial in China could come early next month, while Gilead has begun two international trials of the drug that previously failed as a potential Ebola treatment. And the National Institutes of Health last month began testing it on patients in a U.S. trial.
""We are focusing on high risk patients,"" said Dr. Andre Kalil, infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the U.S. trial s lead investigator. ""Our hope is that remdesivir will show that patients will be improving faster.""
Companies including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc , Eli Lilly and Co  and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (T:4502) have begun to develop coronavirus treatment candidates, but human testing of their drugs has not yet started.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co   on Thursday moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business from the coronavirus pandemic.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker, whose shares closed off slightly after sinking as much as 8.9% earlier in the day, also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production due to the fast-spreading virus.
The move will give Ford more than $37 billion in cash, almost matching the revenue it reported in the fourth quarter. That dwarfs the company s market capitalization of about $18 billion. 
 Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note that corporate liquidity during the outbreak was ""top of mind"" and that U.S. automakers had strong balance sheets. 
The coronavirus outbreak, which started in China last year, has caused about 219,000 infections and more than 8,900 deaths globally.
Comparing the current economic situation to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said Ford was putting in place safeguards to protect its business. 
""We re at war with the virus and Ford is going to win,"" Hackett told employees on a video conference.
Ford has come under fire from some analysts on Wall Street for moving too slowly to cut costs and restructure its business. 
At the end of last year, it had booked only $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take in its global restructuring.
Since then, the outbreak has spread globally, leading Ford, General Motors Co  and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV ,  on Wednesday to announce the shutdown of their North American plants to prevent the spread of the disease among their factory workers.
All three Detroit automakers have seen U.S. employees test positive for COVID-19, the contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus.
Electric carmaker Tesla Inc  on Thursday suspended production at its California car plant, starting March 24, to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, and added that its cash position was strong enough to navigate this period of uncertainty.
OUTLOOK REVISIONS
The outbreak has already hit other automakers and more are expected to slash their 2020 forecasts. 
Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note that such actions ""will be an ongoing theme in addition to the removal of (stock) buybacks.""
On Wednesday, German luxury automaker BMW AG  cut its 2020 profit outlook, saying it would be ""significantly lower"" than last year. Two days before that, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (SS:601633) also cut its 2020 sales and profit targets.
GM and FCA did not change their profit forecasts on Thursday.
""We are dedicated to managing our cost structure against this dynamic environment,"" GM said in a statement. ""We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make any necessary decisions to stay resilient.""
GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity at the end of 2019, including $17.3 billion in cash.
""We are evaluating the impact of all steps being taken inside the company related to the coronavirus emergency on our current financial guidance,"" FCA said in a statement, adding it would provide an update when it has ""sufficient visibility on market conditions."" 
FCA had 23.1 billion euros ($24.94 billion) in liquidity at the end of 2019.
Shares of  Uber Technologies Inc   closed up more than 38% on Thursday after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company had plenty of cash on hand.
""In any crisis, liquidity is key,"" he said on an investor call. 
Ford said on Thursday it notified lenders it would borrow the unused amounts of the two credit lines, totaling $15.4 billion. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company had $22 billion in cash at the end of last year.
The dividend suspension will save Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion. 
The company said it was prioritizing financial flexibility and investments in future technologies such as self-driving cars and a series of important 2020 vehicle launches including a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck.
Ford also withdrew its 2020 profit outlook. In February, before the coronavirus hit the United States, it offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share.
Ford said it would update its outlook when it reports first-quarter results on April 28.

Also on Thursday, Ford said it would offer new-car buyers up to six months of payment relief. Some U.S. dealers have begun to see sales drop off because of the virus, which has already drastically hurt demand in other countries."

WTI oil rebounded from a plunge that had taken it to almost $20 a barrel on Wednesday.
Investors are trying to guess at whether the unprecedented policy actions taken to fight the effects of the coronavirus pandemic would be enough, even as Donald Trump dubbed himself a “wartime president” ready to do whatever it takes. The rush into cash and havens has battered risk assets almost everywhere, particularly equities, high-yield bonds and non-dollar currencies.
The latest developments include the European Central Bank launching a 750 billion euro ($815 billion) debt-buying program to keep borrowing costs in check, and the Federal Reserve’s debut of a program to support money-market mutual funds.

Passenger flights were banned from Belgrade s Nikola Tesla  airport, operated by France s Vinci, for the first time since 1999 when flights were halted during the NATO bombing of the country and the war in Kosovo.
The airport remains open only for humanitarian flights and planes with special permits. Serbia had already barred flights to and from the airport in the southern city of Nis.
At a news conference later in the day, President Aleksandar Vucic said that as of 8 AM on Friday, Serbia s border crossings will be closed for all passenger road and rail transport.
""Nothing but trucks will be allowed to enter,"" he said. ""From noon tomorrow we will also halt commercial passenger transport inside the country.""
The European Union membership candidate country has already introduced a night curfew, ordered the elderly to stay indoors and in line with a state of emergency imposed on Sunday, deployed military at the borders. 
Serbia currently has 103 confirmed coronavirus cases, up from 97 from earlier in the day, out of 506 people tested. There have been no fatalities so far. 
Vucic said he feared the contagion would now spread. ""The clinic for infectious diseases is almost full,"" he added.
Serbia started the hectic purchase of respirators and other medical equipment from abroad to bolster its hospitals, and sought medical help from China, which will send its experts to the Balkan country by the end of the week.
Over the past four days, almost 72,000 Serbians working in the West, many in Austria and Italy which are hard-hit by the coronavirus infection, flocked home. 

Vucic, who repeatedly warned them not to come back to Serbia, sharply criticized those who avoid self-isolation of up to three weeks, warning they may face criminal charges and hefty fines."

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - From Washington to London, Beijing to Rome, governments are drafting automakers and aerospace manufacturers to ramp up production of ventilators and other medical equipment to bolster what most experts say is an inadequate arsenal of coronavirus treatment tools.
Authorities are hoping large-scale manufacturers can use their low-cost supply chains and digital design expertise, including 3D printing, and repurpose some factories in order to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware. 
Some of Britain s biggest aerospace and car companies have formed three teams to produce basic ventilators to help the country s National Health Service cope with the coronavirus outbreak. 
 Meggitt   Plc, which builds components including oxygen systems for civil aerospace and military fighter programs, is leading one consortium alongside engineers GKN , Thales SA and Renishaw Plc. 
The other two teams are being led by carmakers McLaren, which is looking at how to design a simple version of a ventilator, and Nissan Motor Co, which is working with others to support existing ventilator producers. 
Ventilators, machines which move air in and out of the lungs, could be the difference between life and death for coronavirus patients suffering breathing difficulties. 
But getting new production up to speed will not be easy, some in the manufacturing industry said. 
“Precision milling and 3D printing techniques could help manufacture complex parts,"" said Rene-Christopher Wollmann, program and platform director at Automobili Pininfarina, which uses virtual design software to build electric hypercars. 
""But this depends on how much know-how existing manufacturers (of ventilators) are prepared to share about the design of such a machine,"" he added. ""Another bottleneck will be assembling such machines under conditions which are adequate for the medical industry."" 
MADE IN CHINA 
The idea of using automakers to supply medical equipment got started in China, where electric car maker BYD earlier this month began turning out 5 million face masks and 300,000 bottles of hand sanitizer a day. The Shenzhen-based automaker is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett. 
Since then the idea has spread to other industries and countries. 
European aerospace group Airbus is working across its processes to see if its 3D printing or production facilities can be of use.
""The aim is for there to be a (ventilator) prototype in two weeks and for manufacturing to start in four weeks,"" one person familiar with the situation at the company said.
In northern Italy, the epicenter of the virus outbreak outside China, Italian carmakers Ferrari and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are in talks with the nation s biggest ventilator manufacturer to help it boost production, company officials said on Thursday.
The Italian government has embarked on a big expansion of intensive care beds, many of which will require ventilators. 
A source familiar with the matter said sports car maker  Ferrari NV   would be ready to start manufacturing ventilator parts in its famous Maranello headquarters, close to a ventilator factory operated by small medical equipment maker Siare Engineering. The luxury carmaker had yet to make a final decision.
""We re talking to Fiat Chrysler, with Ferrari and (component maker) Marelli to try to understand if they can lend us a hand in this process for the electronics part,"" Siare Engineering Chief Executive Gianluca Preziosa told Reuters. 
Siare could also benefit from the automakers  purchasing power, Preziosa said.
A spokesman for Exor NV, parent firm of both Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari, said meetings had taken place on Thursday with Siare to study the feasibility of the idea and that a decision was expected shortly.
The spokesman said two main options were being considered: help Siare to engineer a capacity increase at its plant with the support of technicians provided by Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari; or outsource production of ventilator parts to the carmakers  facilities.
DETROIT TO THE RESCUE 
In the United States, the federal government is in talks with Detroit auto giants General Motors Co  and Ford Motor  Co about how they can help expand ventilator production, the companies and White House officials said on Wednesday.
It would not be the first time Detroit retooled auto plants to confront a national crisis. During World War Two Ford, GM and the former Chrysler stopped building cars and directed their factories and engineers to mass-produce airplanes, tanks and other weaponry at unprecedented levels, earning Detroit the nickname the ""Arsenal of Democracy.""
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, a law dating back to the Korean War of the 1950s which grants the president broad authority to ""expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base,"" which could allow the government to speed production of masks, respirators, ventilators and other needed equipment.
Ford CEO Jim Hackett told employees in a town hall meeting that Ford is working on building ventilators if the idea is feasible. GM CEO Mary Barra spoke to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow about the issue after the company announced it would suspend North American production through March 30. 
Separately, Tesla  CEO Elon Musk used his Twitter account to offer his company s services.

""We will make ventilators if there is a shortage,"" Musk tweeted, responding to a suggestion that the billionaire repurpose a factory for the task. The comment immediately drew hundreds of replies urging him to act."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  has told employees it reduced the number of workers at its California vehicle factory to curb the spread of coronavirus as Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company may start producing ventilators to ease a U.S. shortage.
In an email to employees late on Wednesday night, Tesla said it had asked only ""essential employees"" to report to its Bay Area facilities, allowing all others to work from home with San Francisco on virtual lockdown.
In a previous email to employees on Monday, Tesla described essential staff as all those directly supporting factory production, vehicle deliveries and service, saying people in those areas should continue to report to work.
U.S. automakers  Ford Motor Co  , General Motors Co  and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV ,  on Wednesday said they were shuttering their U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico, to stop the spread of coronavirus. 
At Tesla, extra precautions are now being taken to try to protect workers from the highly contagious respiratory illness that has infected more than 10,700 Americans. 
Beginning on Thursday, workers will receive masks and have their temperature checked prior to entry, Wednesday night s email said, adding that more hygiene stations will be added and the cleaning frequency of work areas be increased.
The electric carmaker also said it had not laid off anyone amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Officials from the city of Fremont were to meet with Tesla on Thursday to discuss a county-wide coronavirus lockdown order, a county spokesman said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting.
""We are moving ahead in the full understanding that they will have to comply with minimum basic requirements,"" Ray Kelly, Alameda County s public information officer, said.
Alameda County, where the factory is based, is one of six covered by an order from regional officials to ""shelter in place,"" which limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.
The county sheriff s office said on Tuesday afternoon Tesla was not considered an essential business and cannot continue to operate its factory normally.
Minimum basic operations under the county s order include maintaining the value of inventory, ensuring security and processing payroll and employee benefits.
The electric carmaker told its employees in an email on Monday that federal guidelines allowed it to keep operating vehicle manufacturing operations.
A spokeswoman for the Fremont police department on Wednesday said attorneys from the city and county were discussing how state and federal exemptions factored into the local lockdown order.
A factory employee requesting anonymity told Reuters vehicle production on Thursday appeared to continue unchanged, with workers at the assembly lines working in close proximity.
Tesla s sole U.S. auto factory employs more than 10,000 workers, with annualized production of slightly more than 415,000 units by the fourth quarter.
The coronavirus outbreak comes as Tesla ramps up production of its Model Y sport utility vehicle at the factory, which Musk has said will see higher demand than all of Tesla s other models combined.
Alameda County officials on Wednesday said Tesla had agreed to reduce the number of active workers at its factory to around 2,500.
But Kelly, the county spokesman, said discussions were ongoing about halting vehicle production.
""It sounds to me like they very well could still be making cars. We are continuing to stress to them that they must move to minimum basic operations, if they are still making cars,"" he said.
Separately on Thursday, hundreds of Twitter users welcomed an offer by Musk to make ventilators for coronavirus sufferers, after the United States appealed for donations of respirator masks to combat a shortage.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it was in talks with China and others to help ramp up supplies of health equipment, while General Motors  and Ford Motor  said they were in talks with White House officials.
""We will make ventilators if there is a shortage,"" Musk wrote on Twitter, responding to a fan s suggestion the billionaire re-purpose a factory for the task.

The Trump administration on Tuesday urged U.S. construction companies to donate respirator masks to hospitals and healthcare providers fighting the virus, amid a nationwide shortage."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co  and medical equipment maker Ventec are speeding up efforts under a partnership code-named ""Project V"" to build ventilators at a GM plant in Kokomo, Indiana, to help combat the coronavirus outbreak.
GM said on Monday that work at its Indiana plant, which makes small electronic components for cars, is part of the effort to expand ventilator production. Sources said the GM-Ventec project is known internally as ""Project V."" 
As part of the effort to boost ventilator output from Ventec, GM has arranged for the supply of 95% of the parts needed to build the ventilator and is seeking to source the remaining 37 necessary parts, according to an email to suppliers from Shilpan Amin, GM s vice president of global purchasing.
The goal of the venture is to build up to 200,000 ventilators, said people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that U.S. automakers GM,  Ford Motor Co  , and Tesla Inc  had been given the green light to produce ventilators and other items needed during the coronavirus outbreak. It was not clear what Trump meant by the companies ""being given the go ahead.""

NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto retailers have been slow to embrace e-commerce, but the coronavirus pandemic is changing that.
Online traffic has risen even as in-person showroom traffic has disappeared. Auto dealers are embracing digital tools to close deals without a handshake and arranging for vehicles to be picked up or delivered without requiring customers to come to their stores. 
U.S. new vehicle sales will be hit hard by the pandemic. Demand dropped 13% in the first 19 days of March, according to research firm J.D. Power. In especially hard-hit markets like Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago, where the virus has spread quickly, demand slumped as much as 22%. 
Moody s Analytics said on Friday the new and used vehicle markets could slump by as much as 20% from 2019 levels and stay depressed into 2021. 
Based on a survey of some 40 dealers, analysts at Evercore ISI on Monday estimated the March U.S. seasonally adjusted annual selling rate could be 11 million to 12 million vehicles, on par with levels seen during the 2008/2009 financial crisis.
However, online traffic for the 1,000 U.S. and Canadian dealers served by Roadster, which provides a digital sales platform for everything from financing paperwork to vehicle delivery, was up about 6%.
""Many dealerships are going to get caught with their pants down,"" said Brian Benstock, a dealer in the New York City borough of Queens. ""This will be a watershed moment for the dealership industry.""
Dealers have been doing business online for years, but it has never been a major focus. Only 15% of all transactions are online, according to a November survey of 540 dealers commissioned by the National Automobile Dealers Association. However, they expect online car sales to double by 2025.
Benstock, who began moving most of his sales online in 2015, said companies like Tesla  Inc and retailer Carvana Co, which does all its business online, have begun to change consumer expectations. 
Tesla has always relied on internet orders for its vehicles. It is implementing ""touchless deliveries"" in many locations, allowing consumers to unlock cars using the Tesla App, sign any relevant paperwork and return it to a drop-off location. 
Carvana, which sells used vehicles, expanded the number of cars it sold to retail customers by 89% in 2019 from 2018. 
Despite a sharp decline in its shares, Carvana has a market capitalization twice that of AutoNation Inc , the largest bricks and mortar U.S. retail vehicle chain. AutoNation started boosting investment in its online selling capability well before the virus shock.
David Smith, chief executive of dealership chain Sonic Automotive Inc, said most customers still want to visit a showroom to see the cars they are buying.
“There’s only a small percentage of the market who want to buy their car entirely online and have it delivered,” he said.
Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs said the outbreak will accelerate the wider adoption of services that allow customers to stay away from showrooms.
""It s what people wanted going into this,"" she said, citing a Cox January survey that found consumers cited vehicle pick-up and delivery as their top desire. 
Matthew Zappone, general manager of a Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram dealer outside of Albany, New York, is encouraging his sales staff to use FaceTime to show customers the vehicle features they want to see without visiting the store.

""If you haven t been doing it to this point, you re under-prepared,"" Zappone said. "

Tesla s purchase comes as governments across the globe appeal to automakers and aerospace companies help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment.
""China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &  Medtronic   ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA,"" Musk said on Twitter.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday said the state would receive 1,000 ventilators from Tesla as the United States braces to deal with an influx of patients infected by the coronavirus.
Authorities are hoping large-scale manufacturers can use their low-cost supply chains and digital design expertise, including 3D printing, and repurpose some factories in order to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware.
Carmakers have cautioned that assembling delicate medical equipment to standards adequate for use in hospital intensive care units remains a challenge.

NEW YORK/ LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - New York state suffered another quick and brutal rise in the number of COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, staggering hospitals at the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, as California said it could be facing the next major wave of the disease.
In New York City, the densely packed home of more than 8 million people, healthcare officials tried to find hospital beds for the surging number of coronavirus patients as the statewide death toll rose to 210, with more than 25,600 confirmed cases.
The White House advised anyone who has visited or left New York to isolate themselves.
""Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn t spread to others, no matter where they have gone, whether it s Florida, North Carolina or out to far reaches of Long Island,"" Deborah Birx, who is helping lead the White House coronavirus tax force, said at a late-afternoon press conference. 
The expected need for hospital beds in New York state at the peak of the outbreak has spiraled to 140,000, nearly three times what are available. Infections were now doubling every three days in New York and the worst could still be two to three weeks away, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. 
Nationwide, COVID-19, which broke out late last year in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 53,000 people and killed at least 720.
President Donald Trump declared major disasters for New York and Washington state, the nation s first hot spot and accounting for at least 117 deaths, and said he would soon do the same for California.
 A GREAT NATIONAL TRIAL 
""We are enduring a great national trial,"" Trump said. The president softened a vow to reopen the nation s economy by Easter, saying he ll listen to experts first, including Birx and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
In California, where 51 people have died and 2,200 tested positive, Governor Gavin Newsom said fully half the confirmed cases were between the ages of 18 and 49, figures he said are ""a reminder for everybody to take this seriously.""
Newsom cited the death of a teenage boy in Los Angeles County, although health officials there said the case was complex and an ""alternate explanation"" is possible.
Newsom, who warned that half of Californians - or about 25 million people - could potentially be infected in the coming two months, said the next six to eight weeks would be pivotal in determining whether a clampdown on residents has slowed the spread of coronavirus.
California also desperately lacks the hospital beds it needs to care for so many critically ill patients, Newsom has said, although Tesla  co-founder Elon Musk “came through on his promise” to deliver over 1,000 badly needed hospital ventilators, and the state brought another 3,000 online.
The U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy was expected to arrive at in Los Angeles on Friday with 1,000 hospital beds to ease the burden on the state s healthcare system.
Despite the crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933 after U.S. lawmakers said they were close to a deal for a massive economic rescue package in response to the outbreak.
NERVES FRAY ACROSS AMERICA
The World Health Organization said on Tuesday the United States had the potential to become the global epicenter of the pandemic, citing a ""very large acceleration"" in coronavirus infections.
Democrats, including Governor Cuomo, have criticized Trump, a Republican, for suggesting he would reopen the nation s economy by mid-April. 
""If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it s no contest. No American is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,"" Cuomo said earlier in the day.
Newsom did not criticize Trump but said April would be ""sooner than any of the experts that I’ve talked to would believe is possible” for California to lift its restrictions.
The governors of at least 18 states in recent days have issued stay-at-home directives. The sweeping orders, unprecedented in their breadth and depth, encompass about half the nation s population.
The rules are based on social distancing principles designed to put more space between individuals in order to slow the spread of the highly contagious and potentially lethal virus.
Even before the first statewide controls went into effect last week in California, the coronavirus pandemic had virtually paralyzed sectors of the U.S. economy and upended daily lives of Americans as school districts and colleges canceled classes. 
Americans reported frayed nerves after days of working from home, unable to take part in many activities and looking after children with no schools to attend.
Terri Gilbert Thompson, 44, and her husband Scott, both teachers in Hilltown, Pennsylvania juggled teaching remotely with homeschooling their own three children. 

""It has been a challenge, but we are willing to make it work to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread,"" Thompson said. “We’re doing our best to keep our students engaged in learning, monitor and enrich our own kids’ learning, while maintaining our own sanity during this challenging time.”"

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co  and  Ford Motor Co   have widely touted their commitment to emission-free electric cars, but their production plans show a growing reliance on ever-larger gas-powered vehicles. 
The two biggest U.S. automakers will make more than 5 million SUVs and pickup trucks in 2026, but only about 320,000 electric vehicles, according to detailed production plans for North America seen by Reuters. 
That will be about 5% of their combined vehicle production in North America, but less than Tesla Inc , the world leader in electric vehicles, produced last year.
The plans show that Detroit s Big Two are betting their short-term future on satisfying America’s demand for bigger, petroleum-fueled vehicles which they can sell at a higher profit margin than mostly smaller, expensive-to-develop electric vehicles.
Large SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than midsize cars, meaning the plans will most likely wipe out any gains in overall fuel efficiency or reduction in auto emissions that were targeted over the next six years, according to industry experts. 
The recent collapse of oil prices - pointing toward cheap gas for the foreseeable future - and a dip in demand caused by the coronavirus may only serve to strengthen automakers  commitment to the strategy.
Detroit has tried to latch onto the consumer and investor excitement over electric vehicles made by Tesla, whose market value is double that of GM and Ford combined, even though its sales are much smaller.
GM executives have been repeating a ""zero emissions"" mantra since 2017, and the company s website features a prominent commitment to its ""all-electric future."" Ford s Executive Chairman Bill Ford told the Detroit auto show two years ago: ""We’re all in on this. We’re taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we’re electrifying them.""
But it is hard to detect a major change of direction from the companies  production plans.
According to data from AutoForecast Solutions seen by Reuters, North American production of SUV models by GM and Ford will outpace production of traditional cars by more than eight to one in 2026, and 93% of those SUVs are expected to be gas-fueled. The data has not previously been reported.
GRAPHIC: Greener vehicles: how soon? https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-EMISSIONS-SUVS/0100B5LX477/index.html 
AutoForecast s data is based on planning information provided to suppliers by the automakers, and is widely used across the industry. GM and Ford executives interviewed by Reuters did not dispute the accuracy of the data. 
""GM and Ford understand that buyers want more SUVs and trucks, but they’re also trying to play to Wall Street, which thinks the future is all about electric vehicles,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president, global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast. ""The Detroit automakers would love to get a little of that Tesla magic and money.""

 DON T VIOLATE THE LAWS OF ECONOMICS 
Internal production plans from other industry sources seen by Reuters support AutoForecast s numbers, which show GM and Ford expect to produce about 320,000 pure electric vehicles - powered solely by a battery - in North America in 2026. That is nearly 10 times the 35,000 they have planned to build in 2020, but fewer than the 367,500 Tesla delivered last year. 
It is only a fraction of the 5.2 million SUVs and pickups that GM and Ford expect to make in North America in 2026, according to the AutoForecast data, up 14% from 4.6 million SUVs and pickups in 2019. SUVs and pickups will account for about 87% of vehicles made by GM and Ford in the region in 2026, compared with about 82% last year.
Executives at GM and Ford told Reuters in interviews they are serious about launching more electric vehicles in the United States in the coming years, but they are concerned about getting too far ahead of mass-market demand.
""We’re trying to time this with the natural demand of consumers (so) we’re not forced to do artificial things and we don’t violate the laws of economics,” Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product development and purchasing officer, told Reuters.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in early March the company planned to spend $20 billion to bring a million electric vehicles a year to market by the middle of the 2020s. A majority of those are expected to be built and sold in China, where a government mandate calls for increasing numbers of electric vehicles. 
""We want to meet customer demand with the best possible (carbon) footprint on the planet to help improve the CO2 (carbon dioxide) situation,"" said Doug Parks, GM s executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, regarding GM s production plans for SUVs and electric vehicles in North America.

CHEAP GAS, BIGGER TRUCKS
The long-term battle between electrons and petroleum to be the primary energy source for future transportation took an unexpected turn with a crash in oil this month that sent fuel-pump prices to 20-year lows, with no signs of rising, making the cost of running internal combustion vehicles even more attractive to buyers. 
The spread of the coronavirus will put more financial pressure on automakers, according to analysts, limiting their capacity to develop and build money-losing vehicles. A global recession triggered by the epidemic ""could add strain to balance sheets and ability to fund aggressive technology shifts,"" said  Morgan Stanley   auto analyst Adam Jonas. 
In such an environment, automakers are not looking to depart from their winning formula. 
They make more profit on each luxury SUV - such as GM s $80,000 Cadillac Escalade or Ford s $76,000 Lincoln Navigator - than they do on a dozen compact cars, according to analysts. 
Because of that, automakers are replacing compact sedans with small SUVs that share many of the car s mechanical parts, but sell for more. Ford discontinued the Focus compact sedan in the United States, which gets 31 miles per gallon of gas. Ford customers who want a similar-sized vehicle now can buy a 26 miles-per-gallon Ford Escape compact SUV, whose starting price is $6,000 higher.
That may be good for automakers  finances, but probably not for the environment.
SUVs and pickups burn more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than comparable sedans, and those with larger ""footprints,"" - the area between the points where the wheels touch the ground - are subject to looser emissions standards.
Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to roll back tougher fuel economy and emissions standards proposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, removing an incentive for automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles.
That all indicates that any overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions enabled by new electric vehicles will be largely, or entirely, offset by the continued substitution of gasoline-fueled SUVs for cars, experts say.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of this outcome in October, in a report that showed growing demand for SUVs across the world was the second-largest contributor to the increase in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2010 to 2018.
""If consumers  appetite for SUVs continues to grow at a similar pace seen in the last decade, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars,"" said the IEA report. The IEA declined to comment on this story.
The Obama White House predicted that doubling average car and truck fuel efficiency from 2011 to 2025 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion tons. That does not look likely to happen. 
Trump s White House is planning to follow through on its plan to roll back the Obama rules by the end of March, administration officials have told Reuters. 

The Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates U.S. auto emissions, did not respond to a request for comment."

BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc  plans to slash on-site staff at its Nevada battery plant by around 75% due to the coronavirus pandemic, the local county manager said on Thursday. 
The move comes after its Japanese battery partner Panasonic Corp (T:6752) said it would scale down operations at the Nevada factory this week before closing it for 14 days. 
The factory produces electric motors and battery packs for Tesla s popular Model 3 sedans. 
""Tesla has informed us that the Gigafactory in Storey County is reducing on-site staff by roughly 75% in the coming days,"" Austin Osborne said in a post on the county s website. 
No further details were available and it was not clear how many employees work in the factory. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The Reno Gazette Journal, which earlier reported the planned suspension, said Panasonic has about 3,500 employees at the Nevada plant. 
Tesla said last week it would temporarily suspend production at its vehicle factory in San Francisco Bay Area from end of March 23, as well as at its New York solar roof tile factory.
However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will reopen the New York plant ""as soon as humanly possible"" to manufacture ventilators for coronavirus patients.

Two employees of Tesla have tested positive for coronavirus but have been working from home for the past two weeks and had not been symptomatic at work, Tesla said in an email to employees on Thursday. It did not disclose which unit or at what location the employees work."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China s auto industry has gone from zero to sixty in its post-pandemic campaign drive, with manufacturers and dealers quick to woo back lockdown-weary consumers through campaigns as unusual as a makeup-promoting personality touting car leasing.
Social media celebrity Lipstick King urged millions of fans on a live-streamed shopping show to sign up to a lease deal for General Motors Co s  Cadillac CT4 compact sedan.
""This color has the sense of  I m in charge  independence,"" he said, displaying a scale model of a chocolate-colored car.
The plug is just one part of an eruption of promotional campaigns featuring steep discounts, cold-calling and gimmicks, from an industry obliterated by government restrictions on movement imposed in January to curb the spread of a virus which in China has infected 81,000 people and caused 3,300 deaths.
The economy shrank 21% in January-February with sales in the world s biggest vehicle market last month plunging 79%. Retail sales of passenger cars dropped 45% in the first three weeks of March, and the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers does not expect demand to normalize until the third quarter.
With authorities gradually easing restrictions, automakers and dealers have started the engines on their promotional machinery to undo what consulting firm IHS Markit described as an ""unprecedented and almost instant stalling of demand"".
U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc  has launched test-drive and delivery services involving no staff contact, while Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd is delivering disinfected cars and dropping off keys with drones.
The EV unit of Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (SS:601238) is even testing a system to perfume its Aion LX SUV with the aroma of traditional Chinese medicine.

FREE MASKS
SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW) - a venture between SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104), U.S. maker GM and a local partner - on Feb. 25 started offering up to 11,000 yuan off purchases of its Wuling and Baojun brand vehicles, until the total discounts given reach 1 billion yuan ($141.69 million). Buyers also get medical masks.
Seeing the promotion, restaurateur Wang Zhiyuan, 37, visited an SGMW dealership in Beijing earlier this month and received a 2,000 yuan discount on a Wuling Hongguang commercial minivan.
Family sauna equipment supplier Mo Xiufeng, 40, was at the same dealership viewing the same vehicle to make a purchase he had been chewing over since before the lockdown.
""I haven t been able to come in the meantime because, fearing the virus, I didn t want to leave my home,"" he said.
The dealership sold just 20 vehicles in February. It targets March sales of 100, versus an average of 500 before the virus.
Due to the campaign, SGMW s nationwide is a picture of even quicker recovery. A spokeswoman said March registered at least five days of sales surpassing 5,000 vehicles, with one day reaching 6,000, exceeding last year s daily average. At the beginning of February, sales were around 200.
NO INVENTORY
Still, industry bodies have called for government help including purchase tax cuts on small vehicles, support for sales in rural areas and eased emission rules. The China Automobile Dealers Association has lobbied for loans to dealerships and temporary liquidity support such as credit lines.
Local authorities in cities that rely heavily on vehicle manufacturing, such as Guangzhou in the south and Ningbo in the east, have also started to offer purchase incentives.
Visits to showrooms by a Reuters reporter and telephone interviews with 50 dealerships across China indicate the campaigns are indeed bringing shoppers back.
A Beijing dealership for a joint venture between  Dongfeng Motor Group  Co Ltd (HK:0489) and Japan s Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267), however, has a problem beyond footfall that is likely to leave March sales in ""single digits"" versus the usual 100.
""The problem now is we don t have enough cars in inventory,"" the sales manager told Reuters.
Dongfeng Honda is based in the city of Wuhan where the virus was first reported at the end of last year, and where business activity has been restricted for two months. A Honda spokesman said production at the venture was gradually increasing.
""The manufacturer said new cars would not arrive until mid-April,"" the sales manager said, standing in a deserted showroom.

WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday invoked emergency powers to require General Motors Co  to build much-needed ventilators for coronavirus patients after he accused the largest U.S. automaker of ""wasting time"" during negotiations.
Trump, who has been on the defensive for not moving faster to compel the production of medical equipment, for the first time invoked the Defense Production Act, saying GM was not moving quickly enough even though earlier on Friday the largest U.S. automaker announced it would begin building ventilators in the coming weeks.
Asked about negotiations with GM over ventilators, Trump expressed anger with the company s decision to close an assembly plant in politically important Ohio. He also criticized GM s prior decisions to build plants outside the United States.
""I didn t go into it with a favorable view,"" Trump told a news conference of the GM talks. White House adviser Peter Navarro said the administration ran into ""roadblocks"" with GM this week. 
GM said in a statement in response to Trump that it has been working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems and GM suppliers ""around the clock for over a week to meet this urgent need"" and said its commitment to Ventec s ventilators ""has never wavered."" 
The act grants the president power to expand industrial production of any key materials or products for national security and other reasons. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other Democrats have urged him to invoke the act, but the president had been reluctant to do so until now.
Democratic U.S. Senator Ed Markey said, ""About time. Now, tell us every day: which companies will be making more of this equipment, how much is being made, and where the equipment is going.""
On Friday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States topped 100,000, the highest in the world according to a Reuters tally. The U.S. death toll topped 1,550. [L1N2BK21G]
Trump also said countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy need ventilators and that if the excess volume is not needed, the United States can export them.
Earlier, Trump lashed out at GM and  Ford Motor Co   for moving too slowly just hours before GM said it would build medical equipment at an Indiana plant.
Trump criticized the U.S. automakers and said he expected the United States would make or obtain 100,000 additional ventilators within the next 100 days.
The attack on the automakers coincided with rising tension between Trump and the Democratic governors of New York and Michigan, who have criticized the administration s response to the COVID-19 epidemic. On Thursday evening, Trump questioned in an interview on the Fox News network whether New York state needed 30,000 ventilators to cope with rising numbers of coronavirus patients, as Cuomo had said.
GM and Ford separately announced earlier this week they were working with medical equipment companies to help boost ventilator production.
GM and its partner Ventec confirmed after Trump s tweets that the No. 1 U.S. automaker would deploy 1,000 workers to build ventilators at its Kokomo, Indiana, parts plant and ship as soon as next month. It was aiming to build more than 10,000 per month with the ability to go higher. Suppliers in the effort were told the target was 200,000 ventilators. 
But early Friday, before GM issued its release, Trump attacked the automaker and Chief Executive Mary Barra on Twitter, reviving his grievance with Barra for closing and selling a car factory in Ohio, a state critical to the president s re-election campaign. 
""General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday. 
""They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed ventilators,  very quickly ,"" Trump said on Twitter of GM and Ventec s effort. ""Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar.""
Trump s comments about GM and Ford came after a New York Times story Thursday suggested the White House had backed away from announcing a major ventilator deal with GM and Ventec because the price tag was too high. That drew criticism from Democrats. 
Following Trump s tweets, Ford said it was moving as fast as it could to gear up its ventilator manufacturing efforts and was in ""active conversations"" with the Trump administration seeking approvals. Ford said it has ""teams working flat-out with GE Healthcare  to boost production of simplified ventilators."" 
Other automakers have said they are working to produce ventilators, masks and other medical equipment. 
On Friday, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said it was ""finalizing agreements to begin working with at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity.""
New York City Mayor Bill be Blasio on Friday said on Twitter that Tesla Inc  had agreed to donate hundreds of ventilators to hospital intensive care units in New York City and the state of New York.
    Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk in response said the electric carmaker was helping locate and deliver existing ventilators. 
    Tesla on Friday did not respond to a request for comment on where it got the ventilators and whether the company was producing any ventilators of its own, something Musk has said the company will do.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) and  Ferrari   previously said they were exploring making ventilators in Italy."

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - China reported a drop in new coronavirus infections for a fourth day as drastic curbs on international travellers reined in the number of imported cases, while policymakers turned their efforts to healing the world s second-largest economy.
The city of Wuhan, at the centre of the outbreak, reported no new cases for a sixth day, as businesses reopened and residents set about reclaiming a more normal life after a lockdown for almost two months.
Smartly turned out staff waited in masks and gloves to greet customers at entrances to the newly-reopened Wuhan International Plaza, home to boutiques of luxury brands such as Cartier and Louis Vuitton.
""The Wuhan International Plaza is very representative (of the city),"" said Zhang Yu, 29. ""So its reopening really makes me feel this city is coming back to life."" 
Sunday s figure of 31 new cases, including one locally transmitted infection, was down from 45 the previous day, the National Health Commission said. 
As infections fall, policymakers are scrambling to revitalise an economy nearly paralysed by months-long curbs to control the spread of the flu-like disease. 
On Monday, the central bank unexpectedly cut the interest rate on reverse repurchase agreements by 20 basis points, the largest in nearly five years.
The government is pushing businesses and factories to reopen, as it rolls out fiscal and monetary stimulus to spur recovery from what is feared to be an outright economic contraction in the quarter to March. 
China s exports and imports could worsen as the pandemic spreads, depressing demand both at home and abroad, Xin Guobin, the vice minister of industry and information technology, said on Monday. 
The country has extended loans of 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) to 5,000 businesses, from 300 billion allocated to help companies as they resume work, Xin said. 
Authorities in Ningbo said they would encourage national banks to offer preferential credit of up to 100 billion yuan to the eastern port city’s larger export firms. The city government will subsidize such loans, it said in a notice.
VIRUS CONCERNS
While new infections have fallen sharply from February s peak, authorities worry about a second wave triggered by returning Chinese, many of them students. 
China cut international flights massively from Sunday for an indefinite period, after it began denying entry to almost all foreigners a day earlier.
Average daily arrivals at airports this week are expected to be about 4,000, down from 25,000 last week, an official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China told a news conference in Beijing on Monday.
The return to work has also prompted concern about potential domestic infections, especially over carriers who exhibit no, or very mild, symptoms of the highly contagious virus.
Northwestern Gansu province reported a new case of a traveller from the central province of Hubei, who drove back with a virus-free health code, national health authorities said. 
Hubei authorities say 4.6 million people in the province returned to work by Saturday, with 2.8 million of them heading for other parts of China.
Most of the departing migrant workers went to the southern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, the eastern provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, and northeast China.
In Hubei s capital of Wuhan, more retail complexes and shopping streets reopened.
Electric carmaker Tesla  Inc has also reopened a showroom in Wuhan, a company executive said on Weibo.
Shoppers queued 1-1/2 metres (5 ft) apart for temperature checks at Wuhan International Plaza, while flashing ""green"" mobile telephone codes attesting to a clean bill of health.
To be cleared to resume work, Wuhan residents have been asked to take nucleic acid tests twice. 
""Being able to be healthy and leave the house, and meet other colleagues who are also healthy is a very happy thing,"" said Wang Xueman, a cosmetics sales representative.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. new vehicle sales likely drove off a cliff in March as the coronavirus pandemic pounded consumer confidence and shuttered dealerships across much of the country, and sales are likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place. 
""When you look at March, we basically lost half the month,"" said Eric Lyman, chief industry analyst at car-shopping website TrueCar.com . 
TrueCar has forecast a sales drop for March of 37 percent and Lyman said sales in April could also be off between 50 percent to 60 percent.
A rebound for the sector will likely depend on how long the crisis lasts and what level of support the U.S. government provides for consumers in the meantime.
Most major automakers, including General Motors Co  and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), are due to report quarterly U.S. sales on April 1.  Ford Motor Co   and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV  will report sales on April 2.
Tesla Inc  also typically reports first quarter deliveries during the week after the quarter ends. Analysts had expected the company to deliver about 93,000 vehicles during the quarter, according to Refinitiv. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on March 19 suspended production at the company s Fremont, California, assembly plant under pressure from local authorities.
Just how bad March was is an open question. Cox Automotive did not release a monthly forecast, but said its data showed that on March 27, new vehicle sales to consumers fell 55 percent versus the same day in 2019. 
In U.S. states under ""stay-at-home"" orders, sales fell as much as 80 percent to 90 percent, Cox estimated. Those include states like California and New York, home to a large portion of the American car-buying population.
""April will be just as dismal,"" said Cox analyst Michelle Krebs. 
IHS Markit estimates the coronavirus pandemic will cut full-year 2020 sales by 15.3 percent and globally sales will fall 12 percent - ""considerably worse"" than the fall in sales during the Great Recession in 2008-2009. 
More dealers are embracing online sales, which could help mitigate falling sales.
But U.S. consumer confidence plunged in March to the lowest level since October 2016 as the coronavirus epidemic upended life for Americans. 
George Augustaitis, director of automotive industry analytics at  CarGurus  Inc , an online marketplace for new and used cars, said a rebound in new vehicle sales will depend on government support for workers laid off during the crisis.
""If these consumers are taken care of, we should see the market rebound fairly quickly,"" Augustaitis said.

""Device & shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla know,"" Musk said in a tweet https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1245009716935188481.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how many ventilators it has to offer, or how the company will prioritize requests.
Governments across the globe have appealed to automakers and aerospace companies help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment amid a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 777,000 people globally and killed over 37,500.
In United States, states hard hit by the pandemic have pleaded with the Trump administration and manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients.
Earlier this week,  Ford Motor Co   said it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with  General Electric   s healthcare unit, and can then build 30,000 per month as needed to treat patients afflicted with the coronavirus.

Farasis, which said last year that it planned a share market listing, is expected to be valued at around 30 billion yuan after the IPO, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Farasis, whose main products are nickel-cobalt-manganese batteries for electric vehicles, aimed to list in the second quarter this year, they added, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media.
Farasis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The battery maker is raising the most funds of any company that has received approval so far this year to proceed with a STAR board listing.
The planned listing comes as electric vehicle battery makers in China, the world s biggest auto market, are expanding manufacturing capacities, with automakers from Tesla  to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) planning to roll out more electric models.
China s booming electric vehicle sales were cut short last year by a roll-back in government subsidies. However, China on Tuesday reversed the move and will extend subsidies for new energy vehicle (NEV) purchases and extend an NEV purchase tax exemption for two years.
Eleven-year-old Farasis Energy counts China s BAIC BluePark and Great Wall as major customers. It is also building a factory in Germany to help Daimler s Mercedes-Benz ramp up electric vehicle production.
The company has plants in China s eastern cities of Ganzhou and Zhenjiang.
Other major battery makers in China include Fujian-based CATL and Buffett-backed BYD. South Korean LG Chem and SK Innovation are also expanding their capacity as restrictions on the use of foreign battery makers  products have eased.
In a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange, auditor Ernst&Young said Farasis Energy s business operations in the first quarter might be affected by the coronavirus epidemic.
Overall car sales in the country plunged about 79% in February, as customers stayed away from auto showrooms amid social-distancing restrictions."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering temporarily easing quotas designed to boost production of electric cars to help automakers badly bruised by the coronavirus pandemic to revive slumping sales, people familiar with the matter said.
Policymakers in the world s biggest auto market may also delay the implementation of a new emission particle restriction by six months to help the car industry, which has suffered a 79% drop in sales in February and expects a fall of around 10% in the first half of this year.
The United States had already planned to relax vehicle emissions rules. President Donald Trump s administration on Tuesday completed a rollback of vehicle emissions standards adopted under predecessor Barack Obama. This will require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - much weaker than the 5% increases under the previous regime.
""Policymakers acknowledged that automakers are strained to promote electric models when overall demand is slowing. They want the auto industry to recover steadily this year,"" one of the four people familiar with the matter said. 
Authorities are still reviewing the details of the plan, which has yet to be finalised, sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The review is being discussed with officials at industry and environment ministries as well as automakers and industry bodies.
The policy shift comes as Xin Guobin, vice industry minister, said on Monday that China would ""make adjustments on new energy vehicles and related policies to further promote the coordinated and healthy development of the automotive industry.""
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment could not immediately be reached for comment.
China requires automakers doing business in the country to follow strict rules covering the production of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) as part of a quota system. 
China hopes NEVs, such as battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, will account for around a quarter of all cars sold in the country in 2025, up sharply from 5% in 2019.
As a result carmakers, including Tesla , Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors , Toyota (T:7203) and Geely [GEELY.UL], have increased EV production. But the system has also been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve gasoline cars  efficiency.
The change in policy is largely aimed at helping automakers focus on selling more profitable gasoline cars to improve their cash flow. But a small group of companies -- mostly Chinese automakers such as BYD (SZ:002594) -- are already making money from electric vehicle sales.
The temporary easing of NEV quotas is likely to allow companies to delay new model launches, which have more costly technology than conventional vehicles, and also discourage them from aggressive marketing.
China s vice industry minister Xin said the auto industry still faced great difficulties and challenges.
""Even though production has resumed to a relatively high level, it is possible that some enterprises would cut production in the subsequent period due to insufficient market demand and increased inventories,"" he said.

To spur demand, China said late on Tuesday that it will extend subsidies for NEV purchases and extend their purchase tax exemption for two years."

(Reuters) - With auto showrooms shut during the coronavirus pandemic,  Fiat  Chrysler and General Motors Co  moved to reboot demand with seven-year, no-interest loans and programs allowing customers to buy vehicles online.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV s   new ""Drive Forward"" marketing program includes online shopping tools that will for the first time allow U.S. customers to complete the purchase of a vehicle through an FCA dealer without setting foot in a dealership, a company spokesman said.
The move toward online sales and home delivery breaks with a long U.S. auto sector tradition of manufacturers giving franchised dealers control of sales to consumers. Dealers have fought Tesla Inc s  efforts to sell vehicles directly to consumers through its website.
GM and Fiat Chrysler s promotions of extended, no-interest loans - made less costly by the Federal Reserve s recent interest rate cuts - echo the ""Keep America Rolling"" sales push GM launched to jump start a paralyzed consumer market after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
But the pandemic has been pulling auto retailing into the digital age, with dealerships shuttered across the country and sales likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place. [nL1N2BN18I]
FCA shares were down 4.9% to $6.84 in afternoon trading in New York after the company posted a 10% drop in first-quarter U.S. auto sales, as the pandemic hurt demand and halted production from mid-March. The company, however, did not break out sales by month.
General Motors reported its first-quarter sales fell 7% because of significant declines in March, and said customers can use its existing ""Shop.Click.Drive."" program to find, purchase and arrange for home delivery of a vehicle.
A GM spokeswoman said across the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands the automaker has seen two to four times greater online site visits and sales leads than before the pandemic.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said earlier that its U.S. sales fell 43% in March due to the pandemic. 
""It goes without saying that the entire world is facing a tremendous challenge that is having a significant impact on business and our normal way of life,"" Randy Parker, vice president for sales at Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement.
ONLINE PURCHASES
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said its sales were down nearly 37% in March and 8.8% for the quarter. Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) reported a 27% drop in first-quarter sales.
FCA said its ""Drive Forward program"" allows customers to complete the entire vehicle purchase process online.
The system allows consumers to buy vehicles off dealer lots, trade in their old vehicle and apply for a car loan, FCA said.
The company also said that as of April 1 customers can take advantage of 0% interest loans for 84 months and make no payments for 90 days on select 2019 and 2020 model vehicles.

Fiat said momentum in the first two months of the year was offset as the virus hit the economy in March. Its Ram pickup trucks were a bright spot as their sales rose 7% versus the first quarter of 2019."

Invesing.com – Tesla faces a bittersweet near-term future as its deliveries will likely fall short of the target, but the electric automaker s cash pile will help it ride out the Covid-19 pandemic, Bernstein said.
""The company’s pain is likely to extend through the second and third quarters as the economic weakness wrought by the coronavirus pandemic could dwarf anything seen during the Great Recession,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note.
Tesla  fell 6%.  
Bernstein forecasts that Tesla will miss its unit sales goal this year, pressuring revenue to fall by fifth.
Others on Wall Street agree. 
""To this point, we now believe (Tesla) hitting the 500,000 unit delivery threshold for 2020 is a virtual impossibility,"" Wedbush said, estimating deliveries to within a 400,000 to 425,000 range.
But while many companies are desperate to build up their cash concerns on an expected slowdown in activity amid coronavirus-led recession, Tesla is not one of them as its recent equity raise gives it plenty of room to weather the storm. 
""On the brighter side, Tesla s cash balance is likely to hit its lowest point of around $6.6 billion in the second quarter, and Tesla only has about $100 million of debt due this year, and is facing a $1.4 billion convertible bonds in March 2021,"" Bernstein added.
Tesla is expected to release the first-quarter delivery and production numbers later this week, which will provide investors with an insight into the impact from the coronavirus pandemic, especially in ""the all-important China region with Giga 3 front and center,"" Wedbush said.
""We believe Tesla, like every other auto manufacturer, is seeing demand softness globally over the last month as consumers remain in a virtual lockdown,"" it added."

(Reuters) - Elon Musk s rocket company SpaceX has banned its employees from using video conferencing app Zoom, citing ""significant privacy and security concerns,"" according to a memo seen by Reuters, days after U.S. law enforcement warned users about the security of the popular app.
Use of Zoom and other digital communications has soared as many Americans have been ordered to stay home to slow the spread of coronavirus. 
SpaceX s ban on Zoom Video Communications Inc illustrates the mounting challenges facing aerospace manufacturers as they develop technology deemed vital to national security while also trying to keep employees safe from the fast-spreading respiratory illness.
In an email dated March 28, SpaceX told employees that all access to Zoom had been disabled with immediate effect. 
""We understand that many of us were using this tool for conferences and meeting support,"" SpaceX said in the message. ""Please use email, text or phone as alternate means of communication.""
Two people familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the mail. 
A representative for SpaceX, which has more than 6,000 employees, did not respond to a request for comment. Chief Executive Musk also heads electric car maker Tesla  Inc.
NASA, one of SpaceX s biggest customers, also prohibits its employees from using Zoom, said Stephanie Schierholz, a spokeswoman for the U.S. space agency.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation s Boston office on Monday issued a warning about Zoom, telling users not to make meetings on the site public or share links widely after it received two reports of unidentified individuals invading school sessions, a phenomenon known as ""zoombombing.""
Investigative news site The Intercept on Tuesday reported that Zoom video is not end-to-end encrypted between meeting participants, and that the company could view sessions.
""We want to start by apologizing for the confusion we have caused by incorrectly suggesting that Zoom meetings were capable of using end-to-end encryption,"" the company said in a blog post. ""Zoom has always strived to use encryption to protect content in as many scenarios as possible, and in that spirit, we used the term end-to-end encryption.""  
The company added that it encrypts all content from Zoom meetings where everyone is using the Zoom app and the sessions are not being recorded. It said it was unable to currently encrypt content when users log in using other devices.
Zoom did not immediately respond to requests for comment on SpaceX s decision.

As a defence contractor, California-based SpaceX has been classified as an essential business, allowing it to stay open through shutdowns in California and Texas, the development and testing hub for its Starship rocket that could be used to get to the moon and Mars and send national security satellites to space."

""Dear Elon, Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe with population nearly 40 mln citizens,"" Kiev s embassy in Washington wrote on Twitter late on Wednesday. 
""The pandemic situation in Ukraine is approaching its peak, April is going to be the hardest. People in hospitals need ventilators. We are ready to cooperate! Dyakuyemo! (Thank you!)"" 
Former health minister Ulana Suprun tweeted a separate appeal to the entrepreneur. ""Ukraine is in dire need of ventilators,"" he wrote. There was no immediate response from Musk or Tesla.
Governments across the world, including in Tesla s home the United States, are scrambling to get enough ventilators as patients with respiratory conditions linked to the coronavirus pandemic overwhelm hospitals.
Ukraine had reported 804 coronavirus cases and 20 related deaths as of Thursday morning. It is one of Europe s poorest countries and its healthcare spending is a fraction of its Western peers. 
Some of the country s wealthiest men have chipped in to buy ventilators from abroad, in response to an urgent appeal by hospitals to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
And representatives of state defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom are leading an initiative to boost domestic production of the machines based on technology developed during the Soviet era.
Musk tweeted on Tuesday that he was ready to ""ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device & shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse.""

A week earlier he said Tesla had bought ventilators from China for U.S. hospitals and that a Tesla factory in New York would also start manufacturing them."

Investing.com - Tesla surged in after-hours trading on Thursday after its first-quarter deliveries topped analysts estimates, with the electric automaker hailing its ""best ever"" first quarter of production, despite coronavirus-led disruptions.
Tesla  was up 10% after the report.
Tesla said it had delivered about 88,400 in the first quarter of 2020, markedly up from 63,000 vehicles delivered a year earlier, and above analysts  expectations for 79,908.
The beat on deliveries arrived as the company said it had a record first quarter, producing 102,672 vehicles as the Shanghai factory continued to achieve record levels of production, even as the Covid-19 outbreak hurt output. 
"" In the first quarter, we produced almost 103,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 88,400 vehicles. This is our best ever first quarter performance,"" Tesla said.
Model Y production got underway in January and deliveries started in March, ahead of schedule, the company said. 
Ahead of the report, analysts had expressed little optimism that Tesla would deliver impressive first-quarter numbers, and were doubtful about the company hitting its target 500,000 delivery target for this year.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics had said earlier that nonfarm employment in the U.S. fell by 701,000 in the month to mid-March, far more than the 100,000 drop expected.
Even those data have been largely rendered meaningless by the record spike in jobless claims in the two weeks since the cut-off date for the BLS’s report. In those two weeks, some 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits.
Later this morning, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York deaths from Covid-19 rose to 2935 from 2373.
Among individual stocks, the standout outperformer was Tesla , which said after the bell on Thursday that it had delivered 88,400 cars in the first quarter. The company noted that it deliveries of its Model Y crossover SUV had begun in January and continued  well ahead of schedule.  Tesla stock rose 7%.

The design for the ventilators relies heavily on Tesla car parts, one of the engineers said, enabling the company to redeploy existing stock and produce the devices quickly. 
The video comes two weeks after Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla planned to reopen its New York factory to produce ventilators.
The timeline for production was not specified in the video.
""There s still a lot of work to do,"" said one of the engineers, ""but we re giving it our best effort.""
Governments globally have appealed to automakers and aerospace companies to help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment amid the increasing number of coronavirus infections. 
More than a million people have been infected worldwide by the coronavirus, while over 65,000 have been killed. The United States has the most number of cases at above 300,000.
On March 30,  Ford Motor Co   said it would produce 50,000 ventilators in the following 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with  General Electric  s  healthcare unit, and could then build 30,000 per month as needed.
Musk said on March 31 that Tesla planned to supply FDA-approved ventilators free of cost to hospitals within regions where the electric carmaker delivers.
The Financial Times has reported that the devices donated by Musk to some New York City hospitals were not the type of ventilators that have been in demand for use in intensive-care units. Rather, they were Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure machines, typically used to treat sleep apnea but recently approved by the FDA as an alternative in the event of a ventilator shortage.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Investing.com - Tesla accelerated higher on Monday as Wall Street talked up the electric automaker s potential to grow sales by more than a quarter despite expressing concerns the coronavirus pandemic will hurt its output at its factories in both the U.S. and China and delay its Berlin factory launch.
Tesla  rallied 6%.
Jefferies upgraded Tesla to buy from hold, but cut its target price on the stock to $650 from $800, estimating that the company would likely grow sales by 27% this year, despite its U.S. car factory grinding to a halt amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Jefferies said it expected production to be almost zero for four to six weeks and run 50% below normal levels for three months. The brokerage firm also sees a virus-led impact over the longer term, forecasting that Tesla s plans to open its Berlin factory could be delayed by up to six months.
The note comes just days after Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries that not only topped analysts estimates, but also represented the ""best ever"" first quarter of production."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  told employees on Tuesday it would furlough all non-essential workers and implement salary cuts during a shut down of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Tesla said it planned to resume normal operations on May 4, barring any significant changes, according to an email sent to U.S. employees by in-house counsel Valerie Capers Workman, which was viewed by Reuters. 
The company, which suspended production at its San Francisco Bay Area vehicle and New York solar roof tile factories on March 24, said in the email the decisions were part of a broader effort to manage costs and achieve long-term plans. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The coronavirus pandemic has slashed U.S. demand for cars and forced several other automakers to furlough U.S. workers.
Pay for salaried Tesla employees will be reduced beginning on April 13 and cuts will remain in place until the end of the second quarter, the email said. 
In the United States, workers  pay will be cut by 10%, directors  salaries by 20% and vice presidents  salaries by 30%. Comparable reductions will be implemented abroad.
Employees who cannot work from home and have not been assigned to critical work onsite factories will be furloughed, with workers maintaining their healthcare benefits until production resumes, the email said.
Tesla suspended production at both factories last month after it ended a standoff with authorities concerned about the spread of the coronavirus.
Tesla s sole U.S. auto factory employs more than 10,000 workers, with annualized production of slightly more than 415,000 units by the end of December 2019.
The suspension interrupts a planned ramp-up in production of its Model Y sport utility vehicle at the factory. Demand for the Model Y is expected to be higher than for all of Tesla s other models combined, Chief Executive Elon Musk has said in the past. The Model Y taps into strong demand for SUVs and is much less expensive than the high-end Model X.
Tesla on March 20 said it believed it had enough liquidity to successfully navigate the extended period of uncertainty, with some $6.3 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, ahead of a recent $2.3 billion capital raise.
The company on Thursday surprised investors with strong first quarter delivery numbers despite the coronavirus outbreak hammering nationwide car sales and said Model Y production was ahead of schedule.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mostly higher Wednesday, with markets still searching for direction after Tuesday’s volatile session as investors struggle to gauge the spread of coronavirus across the country.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 21 points, or 0.8%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 82 points, or 1.0%. The Dow futures contract rose 191 points, or 0.8%.
A wave of late selling hit stocks Tuesday as an early rally ran out of steam. The Dow fell 0.1%, or 26 points, but had been up about 937 points at the highs of the day. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.3% lower.
The number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. has reached 400,000, doubling over the last week, with over 12,000 deaths.
There are signs the measures, including social distancing, in hot spots like New York and New Jersey are helping to curb the outbreak, but fears exist that other states, like Florida and Louisiana, could see a wave of infections.
Helping the tone are comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that the Trump administration is in talks with Congress to secure an additional $250 billion to fund loans for small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
 
In corporate news, Tesla   said it was cutting wages and putting staff on temporary leave until it decides to reopen its main faciity in Fremont.

The Public Investment Fund amassed shares in Norway’s largest producer mostly through the open market last week, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified, adding that it’s unclear exactly when the fund bought the holding or if it’s still buying. It also bought stakes in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc,  Total  SA  and  ENI   SpA, according to another person with knowledge of the matter.
Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund, run by Yasir Al-Rumayyan and controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is taking advantage of a slump in stock market valuations as it steps up deal-making to become the world’s biggest manager of sovereign capital, the people said. The fund last month built an 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival  Corp. after its shares slumped due to the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
The PIF is a key part of the crown prince’s efforts to diversify the Saudi economy away from its dependence on oil and has made a series of high-profile investments in recent years. Its amassed holdings in Uber Technologies  Inc. and Tesla  Inc., as well as committing giant sums to Softbank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund.
Oil Policy
Still, building stakes in some of the largest international oil companies is unusual, especially as Al-Rumayyan also heads up state-owned crude producer  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222). He’s also a close adviser to the crown prince, who sets the kingdom’s oil production policy and influences prices globally.
Representatives for the PIF and all of the oil companies declined to comment.
On top of the slump of oil prices and a meltdown in global markets, Gulf sovereign wealth funds are channeling some of their billions back home to counter slowing economic growth triggered by the coronavirus. The decline in assets from funds in countries such as Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia could exceed $300 billion this year, according to the Institute of International Finance, the industry’s global association.
In contrast to 2015, the last time crude prices collapsed, Saudi Arabia will likely focus on borrowing rather than drawing down PIF funds, according to the IIF. Last month, Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan said the kingdom would fund an expected larger deficit through borrowing more rather than drawing down reserves.
Equinor shares slumped just over 30% this year before rising 18% last week, amid a broad recovery for European energy majors, giving the company a current market value of about $44 billion.
The Wall Street Journal was first to report that the PIF has acquired stakes in Shell, Total and Eni, worth about $1 billion along with the Equinor holding, citing people familiar."

The development comes at the tail end of a Sino-U.S. trade war characterised by tit-for-tat tariffs on goods and services as varied as metals and cars, which bumped up prices of U.S. made goods in China.
It also comes after Tesla suspended production at its San Francisco Bay Area plant due to the broader impact of the coronavirus, with plans to resume normal operation on May 4.
Tesla said it aims to start delivering Shanghai-made Long Range Model 3 cars from June this year, priced 339,050 yuan after subsidies.
The rear-wheel drive variant, with a driving range of over 600 kilometres before needing to be recharged, differs from the imported version which was all-wheel drive and priced 439,900 yuan.
The locally made Performance Model 3, for which deliveries are slated for the first quarter next year, will be priced 419,800 yuan, the California-based automaker said without specifying the price after subsidies. Imported Performance Model 3 vehicles were priced 509,900 yuan.
The move contrasts with a previous plan from Tesla s billionaire chief executive, Elon Musk, under which the automaker would only make more affordable versions of the Model 3 sedan at its $2 billion Shanghai factory.
Tesla sold 10,160 vehicles in China in March, versus 3,900 in February, marking its highest-ever monthly sales in the world s largest auto market, industry data showed.

Tesla also said it will cut the pay of global vice presidents in China by 30% and that of China-based director-level executives by 20%, to be consistent with operations in the United States. Salaries of other China-based staff are unchanged, it said."

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc  surged 12% on Tuesday after  Credit Suisse   upgraded its rating on the electric carmaker and as Wall Street rallied on optimism the coronavirus outbreak was reaching a plateau.
The stock has jumped 28% in the past two days as investors look beyond disruptions caused by the pandemic, which has forced Tesla to close its California factory, furlough workers and cut salaries.
Credit Suisse raised its rating on Tesla to ""neutral"" from ""underperform,"" saying short-term changes in demand related to the outbreak will distract traditional automakers like General Motors  and Ford Motor  in their gradual transition toward electric vehicles.
""Coronavirus disruption will make it more difficult for legacy automakers to balance the long-term shift (to electric vehicles) in the face of near-term cycle disruption,"" Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy wrote in a research note.
Levy raised his target price by $165 to $580, compared to Tesla s price of $733 on Tuesday.
Tesla s stock has doubled from its March low and remains down 20% from its record high close in February, before fears about the coronavirus  impact on the global economy triggered a deep stock market sell-off.

Investing.com – Wall Street traded near session highs on Tuesday as investors seemingly upped bets on large-cap tech stocks that are well equipped to benefit from an eventual economic restart, even as the first wave of quarterly earnings indicated there is plenty of coronavirus-led uncertainty ahead.
The Dow jumped 2.23%, or 521 points, theS&P 500 gained 3.01% and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.94%.
The recent wave of optimism on the economy reopening sooner rather than later appears to have drummed up investor appetite for technology stocks that had led the previous bull market, with FAANG names, in particular, up sharply.
Facebook , Apple , Amazon , Netflix  and Google parent Alphabet  rallied more than 4%, with investors appearing to favor companies with strong liquidity at a time when the current pandemic has many firms scrambling to save cash.
""A weak balance sheet means going out of business,"" Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures told The Telegraph in March. ""The FAANG companies are all huge cash producers.""
Consumer discretionaries also contributed to the wave of green across Wall Street, led by Tesla.
Tesla  surged 12% after  Credit Suisse   upgraded its rating on the stock to outperform from neutral and hiked its price target on the stock to $580 from $415.
Financials, however, lagged the broader market rally, as quarterly results from banking stocks flagged further economic pain ahead.
JPMorgan Chase  and  Wells Fargo  NYSE:WFC) reported a widely-expected slump in first-quarter profits as they put aside billions of dollars for a potential flurry of loan defaults from customers. Johnson & Johnson , meanwhile, surged 4.6% after reported a jump in profit, led by increased demand for over-the-counter medicine.
Earnings aside, investor optimism on an economic restart sooner rather later has also supported sentiment, with governors across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island expressing a willingness to work together on reopening plans.
Calls for the economy to restart have been underpinned by signs of slowing infections in hotspots like New York, which is the epicenter of the global pandemic, with gross new daily hospitalizations in the state slowing to 1,649 from 1,958 a day earlier, the lowest since March 24.
Against the backdrop of recent optimism, however, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday that a May 1 target date for reopening the economy was ""a bit overly optimistic,"" Reuters reported."

Zoox said the settlement required it to pay Tesla an undisclosed amount and undergo an audit to ensure that none of its employees had retained or are using Tesla s confidential information.

But the experience many of them have had in China illustrates just how long a slog it’s going to be before plants are producing at anywhere near pre-shutdown levels. It took almost two months for most of China’s industry to return to some semblance of normalcy -- and that was with the benefit of mobile apps the government installed on citizens’ cell phones to track their movements and potential exposure to Covid-19 infected people.
North American factories may have the benefit of Apple Inc . and Google  trying to start a similar contract-tracing effort, but participation will be voluntary. And the tensions brewing already between President Donald Trump and state governors indicate U.S. government efforts won’t be nearly as centralized as China’s was, suggesting that already cash-strapped suppliers may also have to deal with a patchwork of state-by-state orders dictating when businesses can reopen.
“Discipline is the key to success,” Jim Tobin, the president of Asia operations at auto-parts maker Magna International Inc., said last week. “In China, there’s mandates that come out. Here, there are requests.”
Magna and other companies implemented dozens of protocols -- including worker-temperature screenings and physical distance barriers -- to open factories on single shifts, Tobin said during a webinar hosted by the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many vehicle and parts plants in North America had been running multiple shifts to meet demand that’s held steady near all-time highs for years. Now, sales have cratered and are unlikely to recover quickly.
Tesla  Inc. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  both are planning to begin reopening U.S. plants on May 4 after idling them in mid-March. General Motors Co . and Ford Motor  Co. have refrained from scheduling restart dates for their facilities, while  Toyota  Motor Corp.  and  Honda  Motor Co   have said theirs will be down through at least May 1.
While setting dates to reopen sends a signal to suppliers to start getting their parts inventories ready, doing so won’t be simple, with new layers of precautions and complications that didn’t exist before shelter-in-place orders came into effect nearly a month ago.
Here’s a rundown of what the industry is grappling with as it prepares for a restart:
Patchwork of Orders
A typical vehicle has thousands of parts, and as automakers survey their supply chains, they now have to look not just at inventories, but at health orders across the country. What the virus curve looks like in Illinois compared with Michigan or Ohio could determine whether or not a vehicle will have all the components needed to resume production.
“What the manufacturers need to do is be able to map out state by state, county by county, where manufacturers are with regards to local lockdown stay-at-home orders,” said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group’s U.S. automotive practice.
Even in states where people are allowed back to work, auto companies will likely use staggered shifts to increase social distancing and allow for more frequent deep cleaning. They’ll also likely deal with high rates of absenteeism, especially among older workers who fear getting infected, Collie said.
Supply Chain
Suppliers typically need a week or two of advance work to support an automaker’s ability to start running their assembly lines again, said Anne Marie Uetz, a Detroit-based partner at the law firm Foley and Lardner LLP, which represents parts manufacturers. And there are at least two major impediments the supply chain will be dealing with: kids and cash.
With many school systems closed until the end of the year, parents within the workforce will have to find some form of child care before reporting back to plants. Many will be wary of bringing the virus home to their families.
The other problem is cash flow. With production already having been shut down for roughly a month, suppliers’ coffers are starting to run dry and many need help with the expenditures necessary to restart, Uetz said. Some are getting assistance from the federal government, but automakers also are negotiating ways to help.
The dire financial straits many suppliers are in doesn’t leave much room for error in deciding on when to resume output, Magna’s Tobin said.
“Start-stop does not help liquidity, because we start buying material, employing people, then they say, ‘We’re going to push it out another two weeks,’” Tobin said, referring to supplier-carmaker relationships.
PPE Needs
Much of the auto industry has pivoted to supporting the health-care industry by making ventilators, masks, face shields and medical gowns. Some of those efforts to make personal protection equipment -- or PPE -- will come in handy for their own workforce, which pushed back against keeping factories open last month.
Social distancing and barriers will be go-to tools, but for workers who can’t avoid close interaction, they’ll need face shields, said Aaron McCarthy, Magna’s chief of human resources. Companies may be unable to provide them until front-line health care workers have enough.
Ford is already tallying up the equipment needs for its workplaces, Jim Farley, the automaker’s chief operating officer, said in a podcast interview with Automotive News last week.
“We’re identifying all the PPE requirements, which is millions and millions and millions of equipment we’re going to need to bring people back,” Farley said. “We’re not going to bring anyone back or even think about it before we have the sufficient supplies.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks extended their losses midday Wednesday as grim economic data and earnings finally overshadowed Federal Reserve dollars and underscored how much repair the global economy will need when it restarts.
By 11:45 AM ET (1545 GMT), all three major indices were extending earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 660 points, or 2.75%. The S&P 500 was down 2.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2%. They had posted rises of between 2.4% and 4.0% on Tuesday, all hitting their highest levels in over a month.
The market was brought down to earth by the biggest-ever monthly drop in retail sales in March, a set of data that didn t even include the full impact of the lockdowns that have been imposed across the country in stages. Retail sales fell by 8.7%, with autos and discretionary items hit particularly hard. Core sales, which exclude autos, fell by a slightly better-than-expected 4.5%. 
There was equally bad news from the nation s factories. Industrial output fell 5.4% in March, another number that far exceeded even the worst monthly falls during the 2008/9 recession. Manufacturing output fell even more acutely, by 6.3%. The Empire State Manufacturing index, which tracks factory activity in New York state, likewise plummeted to a record low of -78.2.
Those numbers were also reported in a raft of sharp falls in earnings at the country s biggest banks, which all reported spikes in provisions against bad loans. Bank of America  stock fell 6.3% and  Citigroup   stock fell 4%.
There was positive news from the airline sector, where stocks rose across the board early on in response to the bailout agreement secured late on Tuesday with the federal government. But even in this sector, stocks reversed early gains to trade broadly mixed. 
United Airlines  stock fell 2.8%, while Delta Air Lines  stock was down 4.5% and American Airlines  stock was down 2.8%. 
Among the outperformers was UnitedHealth  stock, which rose 2.1% after the health insurer said it had seen no substantial impact to profitability from the pandemic so far. It thus was able to stick to its guidance for the year, in contrast to many companies that have had to pull theirs due to the acute degree of uncertainty.
Tesla  was also among the gainers after a report showing its factory in China returned to life in March as lockdowns eased. Tesla stock rose 1% to its highest in five weeks."

(Reuters) - Tesla s  stock extended its recent rally on Wednesday following a surge in China car registrations and after Goldman Sachs  initiated coverage of the electric car maker with a ""buy"" recommendation.
Shares of the Silicon Valley automaker rose nearly 2%, bringing their gain this week to 26% as traders look beyond the short-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced Tesla to close its California factory, furlough workers and cut salaries.
Tesla s China car registrations jumped 450% in March, month on month, data from auto consultancy LMC Automotive showed. Overall auto sales in China plunged 43.4% in March, as a coronavirus pandemic continued to depress demand.
In a note late on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney started coverage of Tesla with a $864 price target, compared to its latest price of $723.
""We believe that the combination of Tesla s product leadership (including its over-the-air updates to continue to improve vehicle performance), brand/early-mover advantage, vertical integration, and the long development cycles in autos (new cars can take 2-4 years to develop) will help Tesla to maintain a strong market position,"" Delaney wrote.
Wall Street has long been divided over Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk. Supporters expect Tesla to become a dominant global car maker, with a fleet of driverless taxis, while many skeptics doubt Tesla can become sustainably profitable.
Goldman Sachs  previous Tesla analyst, David Tamberrino, had a ""sell"" rating and a $158 price target as of last June, the lowest on the street at that time.
Previously, in 2016, Goldman Sachs attracted attention when it upgraded Tesla to ""buy"" just hours before the car maker announced a $2 billion stock offer with Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley   acting as joint lead bookrunners. 

Tesla s stock has doubled from its March low and remains down 20% from its record high close in February, before fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy triggered a deep stock market sell-off."

The ruling means Tesla will have to provide documents and other evidence to the plaintiffs as the case moves forward. Musk will probably have to submit to a deposition. The judge’s ruling also increases the plaintiffs’ leverage in settlement talks, as investors seek billions of dollars in damages to cover their losses.
The company claimed that Musk’s Twitter post on Aug. 7, 2018 -- “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured” -- was “aspirational,” not fraudulent. But a San Francisco federal judge ruled Wednesday that shareholders’ lawsuit claiming the tweet was an intentional deception that jolted Tesla’s stock price can go forward.
“Nothing in the statement suggested it was merely aspirational,” U.S. District Judge Edward Chen wrote. “It appears factual,” and according to the complaint, “was not true,” he added.
Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission suit over the tweet, without admitting guilt. But as Musk continued to tweet about the company, the settlement was amended a year ago to add specific topics he can’t tweet about without advance approval from a Tesla lawyer.
Chen ruled on Wednesday that shareholders made a strong enough case that Musk made false statements “in the scope of his role as CEO of Tesla, with knowledge of the inaccuracies of his statements -- or was, at minimum, deliberately reckless when making such public disclosures” for the lawsuit to move forward.
Tesla didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the ruling.
In his defense, Musk has pointed to conversations he had with the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund a week before the tweet. Investors argued the potential deal was thin on details and might have required Tesla to build a Middle Eastern production facility.Tesla’s stock surged as much as 13% after the tweet, hammering short sellers who hadn’t covered their positions. Other investors who read Musk’s message as a buy sign sustained losses when doubts mounted about his ability to follow through and the company’s share price plummeted. Weeks later, Musk abandoned the idea of going private.
The case is In re Tesla Inc. Securities Litigation, 18-cv-04865, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

(Reuters) - A federal judge said Tesla  Inc and Chief Executive Elon Musk must face a lawsuit claiming they misled shareholders when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take his electric car company private in a $72 billion transaction.
U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled on Wednesday that shareholders could try to prove Musk intended to defraud them with his Aug. 7, 2018 tweet and follow-up messages about plans for his Palo Alto, California-based company.
The judge said shareholders could also try to prove Musk s tweet was the ""proximate cause"" of volatility in Tesla s stock price that caused billions of dollars of losses.
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit arose after Musk stunned investors on Aug. 7, 2018 by announcing on Twitter: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""
Musk’s tweet helped push Tesla s stock price more than 13% above the prior day s close. But it soon gave those gains back, and by Aug. 17, 2018 had fallen 11% below where it was before the original tweet.
Some investors called the tweet a ploy to squeeze short-sellers, long an irritant for Musk, who were betting Tesla s stock would fall.
Musk tweeted on Aug. 24, 2018 that Tesla would remain public.
A month later, he agreed to pay a $20 million civil fine to settle fraud charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC also required Musk to step down as chairman, and Tesla lawyers to vet some of his tweets in advance. Tesla reached a separate $20 million settlement with the regulator.
Tesla s stock price has since roughly doubled, and Musk is worth $37.6 billion according to Forbes magazine.
In letting the shareholder case, which combined nine lawsuits, go forward, Chen said reasonable investors could have viewed Musk s Aug. 7 tweet as signaling he had unconditionally obtained enough financing to take Tesla private.
""So read, the statement is not true,"" Chen wrote.
The judge rejected Tesla s and Musk s argument that the tweet was not false or misleading because Tesla s directors would have still had to approve the transaction.
The proposed class action covers shareholders who bought and sold Tesla stock from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17, 2018. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tesla shares closed up $19.94 at $729.83 on Wednesday.

Investing.com - Wall Street s first-quarter earnings season kicked off this week, with banks taking center stage, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to hammer the economy.
 
JPMorgan , Bank of America ,  Citigroup  ,  Wells Fargo   and Goldman Sachs  all reported alarming plunges in their respective Q1 profit. The nation’s largest banks also increased their loan-loss reserves by billions of dollars amid expectations for a jump in defaults from customers in the coming months.
 
Looking ahead, next week marks the first busy week of the first-quarter earnings season, with many of the big-name U.S. technology stocks, such as Netflix ,  IBM   and Intel  set to report.
 
The week after that then sees high-profile companies such as Apple , Microsoft , Facebook , Advanced Micro Devices , Tesla , Boeing ,  Caterpillar  , and McDonalds release their quarterly results.
 
We re bracing for one of the worst earnings seasons in recent history. Analysts expect Q1 S&P 500 earnings to have fallen 12.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as the pandemic brought much of the global economy to a screeching halt.
 
U.S. stocks have recovered from their March lows, boosted by a raft of U.S. monetary and fiscal stimulus.
 
The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions to support the economy during the coronavirus crisis in recent weeks.
 
There have been rate cuts and a slew of credit and lending programs that could inject more than $6 trillion into the economy.
 
Congress has passed $2 trillion in rescue efforts but continues to squabble over how much more should be allocated and how it should be distributed.
 
The S&P 500 is still down about 18% from its Feb. 19 record closing high, as the path to an economic re-start and the effectiveness of gigantic stimulus packages around the world remain unclear.
 
In the United States, the hardest-hit nation, the coronavirus death toll topped 30,000 on Wednesday and set a record single-day increase for the second day running.
 
President Donald Trump said he would announce guidelines for reopening the economy on Thursday, however, state governors - especially on the East Coast - seem to be pushing for a cautious approach.

(Reuters) - Global vehicle production is now expected to fall more than 20% to around 71 million in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing recession, a top automotive forecaster said Monday.
That steep decline, far greater than anticipated earlier this year, likely will cost global automakers 19 million units in lost production in 2020, according to LMC Automotive, which warned those projections could slip further, depending on how quickly major regions recover.
In North America, where most vehicle production remains shut down in April, automakers have been forced to delay introductions or planned ramp-ups of several new vehicles, including the Tesla  Model Y, the Ford  Mustang Mach E, and redesigned versions of  Fiat  Chrysler s  Jeep Grand Cherokee and General Motors   full-size SUVs, LMC said.
The analyst said it expects vehicle sales will bottom out in April in North America and Europe, with post-pandemic recovery ""unlikely to be rapid"" in the coming months.
China, which was among the first countries hit by the novel coronavirus, already has restarted most of its auto plants and now expects to see a sales decline of just 12% this year, LMC said.
Expectations for a swift economic recovery have plummeted as the virus has swept most of the globe, plunging all major regions into recession, according to researcher IHS Markit.

While the company expects to see the beginnings of an upturn by the end of the year, current projections ""are likely to be revised down"" as the pandemic plays out."

 Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) AB,  NXP Semiconductors  NV  and Bank of America Corp . are among a wave of companies forbidding or warning employees against using Zoom because of concerns about its security, according to people familiar with their operations. They join corporations like Tesla  Inc. and government agencies from Taiwan to Singapore that have banned the app’s use, though the city-state has since backtracked. India has deemed Zoom an unsafe platform and initiated a public contest to develop a secure homegrown video-chat alternative.
Zoom emerged during the global coronavirus lockdown as a home for everything from virtual cocktail hours to cabinet meetings and classroom learning. It passed the milestone of 300 million daily meeting participants this week, having never crossed 10 million before the start of this year. Its share price remains close to a record high achieved in March. However, cybersecurity researchers warn hackers can exploit flaws in the software to eavesdrop on meetings. Weak protection has given rise to the phenomenon of “Zoombombing,” where uninvited trolls gain access to a video conference to harass participants.
Daimler wrote “the software has various security gaps and data protection problems” in a memo to employees reviewed by Bloomberg News. The automaker, employer to close to 300,000 people globally, wasn’t a Zoom corporate customer before but is now explicitly prohibiting the video-calling app, pointing workers to Microsoft Teams as a more trustworthy alternative.
“Daimler prohibits the use of Zoom for corporate content until further notice,” company spokesman Christoph Sedlmayr said in an emailed statement.
Zoom CEO Eric Yuan has focused on bolstering the security of his videoconferencing application with the goal of winning back customers who abandoned the company. Zoom is working on improving its encryption and argues that many of its problems stem from the fact the app was initially geared toward enterprise clients with their own IT security teams instead of the broad consumer app it’s become. Singapore’s government banned Zoom’s usage by schools but later lifted that moratorium after putting in place security safeguards.
NXP, a provider of wireless communications technology, uses  Microsoft Corp  .’s Teams internally and recently banned the use of Zoom with external parties, one person said, asking not to be identified discussing internal matters. Networking giant Ericsson also relies on Teams, previously Skype for Business, for remote meetings and now asks staff not to use Zoom. If clients or partners want to use the app, Ericsson staff will need to make sure the outside parties understand and are willing to accept the risks of using Zoom before proceeding with a meeting, said another person familiar with the measures.
An NXP spokesman declined to comment, while Ericsson said in an emailed statement it has internally approved apps and guidelines for meetings, without elaborating.
“A large number of global institutions ranging from the world’s largest financial services companies, to leading telecommunications providers, government agencies, universities and others have done exhaustive security reviews of our user, network and data center layers and confidently selected Zoom for complete deployment,” said a Zoom spokeswoman via email. “We are proud to be helping these customers maintain business continuity in this challenging and unprecedented time.”
Bank of America doesn’t typically use Zoom internally because it has other video conferencing tools, and in cases where clients seek to communicate via Zoom, bankers need to go through an approval process to use it, a person familiar with the situation said. Of the bank’s 208,000 employees, more than 175,000 are working from home, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.
A Bank of America spokesperson declined to comment."

China has set an ambitious goal for NEVs to account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025 compared with the current 5%, as it seeks to reduce pollution and cultivate home-grown champions.
Under the plan, China would extend subsidies for NEV purchases to 2022, rather than ending them by the end of this year and extend their purchase tax exemption for two years. The government had announced plans in 2015 to end the subsidies this year, but earlier this year said it would extend them.
China will in principle cut subsidies by 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022, the finance ministry said in a statement. But it will not cut subsidies on qualified new energy commercial vehicles earmarked for public purposes this year.
China is the world s biggest car marker where more than 25 million vehicles, including 1.2 million NEVs, were sold last year.
China will raise the requirements for the driving range and power efficiency of cars that qualify for the subsidies, the statement said. It also said the authorities would support the sales of cars with swappable batteries, a technology that has been pursued by Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio Inc and BAIC BluePark. 
Subsidies will apply only to passenger cars cheaper than 300,000 yuan ($42,376.47), it said. This price is lower than starting price of Tesla  Inc s China-made Model 3 sedans before they receive subsidies. 
China also said authorities would give priority to the purchase of new energy vehicles for government use but did not give further details.
The new policy is effective from April 23. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. 
""This extending of subsidies will give the industry long term support but is unlikely to impact short term sales much,"" Cui Dongshu, secretary general at China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). 
Global automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors  and Toyota are ramping up electric vehicle production in China to meet stricter government regulations.
Sales of NEVs contracted for a ninth month in a row in March and were down over 50% from a year earlier, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). "

The wealth surge of America s richest men happened during a period that saw as many as 22 million Americans file for unemployment.
Even as the broader economy faced a recession, tech and stay-at-home stocks like Zoom  have rallied in recent weeks, due to a surge in usage of video conferencing and remote work technology, thus boosting the net worth of billionaire founders with holdings in those companies.
""This is the tale of two pandemics, with very unequal sacrifice,"" said Chuck Collins, a co-author of the report.
During the period between January 1 to April 10 this year, 34 of the nation s wealthiest billionaires have seen their net worth increase by tens of millions of dollars, the report said.
According to the IPS report, eight of these billionaires including Bezos,  Zoom Video Communications  Inc founder Eric Yuan and Musk saw a $1-billion jump in their total net worth.
Musk holds an 18.5% stake in Tesla shares, which has soared over 73% since the beginning of the year as traders looked beyond the short-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Bezos owns about 15.1% in Amazon stock, which has gained nearly 31% this year as online orders on its platform have surged due to people staying indoors. 

In the last decade, wealth of U.S. billionaires jumped over 80.6% adjusted for inflation, the report added."

Toyota Motor Corp., Tesla  Inc., Hyundai Motor Co. and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG are among the major automakers that have said they intend to resume production in the first week of May. Even if they stick to that schedule, many won’t restart all their factories at once, and the facilities that do restore output will run assembly lines at slower rates than they did pre-shutdown.
The non-unionized carmakers’ intentions add to the urgency of talks General Motors Co ., Ford Motor  Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are having with the United Auto Workers that weigh the need to get back to business against the possibility that reopening will sicken employees. Of the three, only Fiat Chrysler is confirming plans to progressively restart beginning May 4, pending approval from governments and unions.
“A lot of automakers are looking at some point in May starting production for at least half or a majority” of their plants, prioritizing those making lucrative pickups and SUVs, said Jeff Aznavorian, president of Clips & Clamps Industries, a supplier to Fiat Chrysler and other manufacturers. “All of them are planning on staggering those openings to make sure their processes are in place so they can go back to work safely.”

Less-Dire Sales
Weeks ago, analysts assumed there would be little reason for the industry to rush its restart. Sales in China plummeted almost 80% in the wake of the country’s coronavirus outbreak early this year, and some were expecting a decline of similar magnitude for the U.S. Yet demand has held up better than expected, with researchers LMC Automotive and J.D. Power predicting a roughly 50% decline this month.

While the UAW likely won’t want to put its companies at a competitive disadvantage or keep its members from earning bigger paychecks again, the union also is leery of reopening plants too soon after two dozen union workers at Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler have died of Covid-19 complications.
“The one thing that is a priority of all parties is the health and safety of UAW Ford, General Motors and FCA employees, their families and their communities,” Rory Gamble, the union’s president, said in a late Wednesday statement.
Slow Ramp-Up
Because many factories were running at full speed prior to the shutdown, automakers were carrying plenty of inventory. The process of restarting production will unfold in stages and it could take months for certain products to return to full capacity.
“We do expect to see a slow ramp-up of volumes over the coming weeks” starting the first week of May, said Julie Fream, chief executive officer of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, an auto parts industry trade group. “That doesn’t mean that all plants will be back online and certainly not that all shifts will be working.”
Not all companies in the supply chain will resume output at the same time, nor are all states in alignment on policy. Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday cautioned automakers in her state to “slowly engage in a safe manner,” while southern governors are pushing hard to become the first to lift shelter-in-place orders.
“Even if the stay-at-home gets extended, there may be some exceptions,” said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for researcher LMC Automotive. “I have no doubt that the industry is lobbying hard for that.”
Schuster expects the industry to produce at 50% of normal production levels or lower at least through May, if not through the remainder of the second quarter. “Following the model they used in China, it’s probably one shift initially, heavy-duty disinfecting and cleaning, slower line rates because of social distancing, staggered entrance and exits, temperature monitoring and, if they can get them, those quick self-administered test kits,” he said.
Pre-Paying for Parts
Cash-strapped smaller suppliers need detailed timelines -- and sometimes pre-paid orders -- before bringing workers back, sourcing new materials and investing in equipment to promote social distancing on their shop floors, said Alan Baum, an independent auto analyst based near Detroit.
It’s typical for suppliers to take in receivable payments on a 45-day delay, so they’re still getting paid for work they were doing before production was halted. By late May and early June, that money will dry up and cause a cash crunch for some companies.
To help bridge the gap, some automakers are considering front-loaded payments to avoid any cash-flow issues. The approach, referred to in the industry as “factoring programs,” generally involves suppliers surrendering a few percentage points of profit in exchange for early payment, OESA’s Fream said.
“Most of the first tier is ramping up in a very organized way, but my clients are often frustrated they’re not getting enough guidance to make specific plans for restarting,” Baum said."

China cut subsidies on electric vehicles by 10% this year, effective April 23, but there will be a three-month transition period.
After the adjustment, the starting price for the Shanghai-made Standard Range Model 3 sedans will rise to 303,550 yuan ($42,900) from 299,050 yuan, while Long Range Model 3 cars, which Tesla plans to roll out from June this year, will be priced at 344,050 yuan versus 339,050 yuan, a company website showed.
Prices for those models before subsidies remain unchanged.
Tesla, which started delivering cars from its $2 billion Shanghai factory last year, saw its China registrations rose to 12,709 units in March from 2,314 in February.
The subsidies will apply only to passenger cars costing less than 300,000 yuan ($42,376) after the transition period. China will also in principle cut subsidies by 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022.
Hit by the coronavirus epidemic, China s overall car sales fell 42% in the first three months compared with a year earlier. But the auto industry expects sales to recover as the government promises more supportive policies to boost consumption.

(Reuters) - It’s pitch black in El Paso, Texas, when the minivans and pickups start lining up at 4 a.m., snaking for more than a mile down the desert roadway leading to the city’s largest food bank.
When rations are finally distributed five hours later, many boxes are filled with too many castoff beefsteak tomatoes but no pasta. Nor is there any rice, beans or other dry or canned goods.
“We really have no dry goods,” said Bonnie Escobar, chief development officer of El Pasoans Fighting Hunger.
Food banks nationwide are squeezed between short supplies and surging demand from needy families as the coronavirus pandemic has put more than 26 million Americans out of work. In New York City, the mayor appointed a food czar as lines of masked people form outside overstretched charities. More than a third of the city’s food banks have closed for lack of supplies, donations or volunteers, who are harder to recruit because of infection fears, according to the New York Mission Society. In San Diego, a local food bank waits on a $1 million order it placed weeks ago. Chicago and Houston food banks say they are nearly out of staples.
Before the pandemic, 1 in 7 Americans relied on food banks, according to Feeding America, a national network of the charities. Now, demand has doubled or tripled at many organizations, U.S. food bank operators told Reuters.
And yet farmers are destroying produce, dumping milk and culling livestock because the pandemic has upended supply chains, making it impossible for many to get crops to market. Grocery stores struggle to stock shelves because suppliers can’t adjust to the sudden shift of demand away from shuttered restaurants to retailers, which requires different packaging and distribution networks.
“The U.S. likely has a surplus of food right now,” said Keith Dailey, group vice president of corporate affairs at Kroger  Co, the No. 1 U.S. supermarket operator. “It’s just hard to recover and redistribute.”
Before the pandemic, Feeding America member organizations received about a third of their food from grocery store programs that “rescue” fresh food and dry goods that are imperfect or close to expiration. Almost a quarter came from government programs that provide meat, cheese and other products. The rest came through donations from farmers and grocers and purchases by the food banks.
Now those supply lines are disrupted. Panic-buying of groceries stripped store inventories of often-donated surplus items, causing grocers to shift to cash donations for food banks. Surging demand from needy families, along with higher prices on some products, is busting food banks’ cash budgets - one Nebraska food bank, for instance, will spend up to $1 million on food in April compared to about $70,000 in a normal month.
“This is not an anomaly” across the region, said Angie Grote, a spokeswoman for Omaha’s Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves communities in 93 counties in Nebraska and Western Iowa.
Many farmers would rather donate food than destroy it, but overwhelmed charities do not have the labor or storage to handle such bulk donations. Neither can the government act fast enough to fill the gap left by disruptions of other sources and the sudden spike in hunger.
The Trump administration faces mounting pressure from trade groups such as the National Pork Producers Council and the National Potato Council to buy more surplus foods and redirect them to charities or schools that continue to provide meals to low-income families after halting classes. That could include, for instance, between $750 million and $1.3 billion worth of potatoes and derivative products that are trapped in the pipeline, the potato council said.
But U.S. Agriculture Department regulations can pose problems in redirecting food from restaurants to charities. The USDA has strict specifications on products that can be purchased for food banks, allowing only certain cuts of meat that are packaged in certain size boxes, said Dallas Hockman, vice president of industry relations for the National Pork Producers Council.
The pork trade group requested that the USDA ease such rules to speed the flow of food to needy families, Hockman said. It normally takes one to three months for the USDA to receive food after a company wins a government contract to provide it for distribution to charities.
Meanwhile, bulk packages of ham and bacon that would normally go to restaurants are sitting in cold storage.
""What we re saying is, for right now, go buy this stuff, get it out of the pipeline and get it to these food banks,"" Hockman said.
The agency did not directly answer questions from Reuters about the concerns that it moved too slowly to address the food bank crisis or suggestions that it relax regulations. The agency repeated a pledge it made in a news conference on April 17 to spend $3 billion in food purchases for its newly announced Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, with monthly $300 million purchases through February 2021. In a call with food distributors Thursday, USDA representatives said the new program could deliver food more quickly than usual and that it expected to begin deliveries to charities by mid-May.
FEAST, THEN FAMINE
Less than a year ago, food banks were overwhelmed by a glut of food from the USDA. The administration’s Trade Mitigation program bought billions of dollars in food from U.S. growers who saw their export markets - especially China - cut off in the tariff war started by President Donald Trump in 2018.
The excess prompted the Greater Chicago Food Depository to build extra cold storage for milk and meat. Today, that storage has been emptied, and food banks are scrambling to buy increasingly scarce and expensive staples, such as canned fruit or peanut butter.
Some items are no longer available or require two-month waits for delivery, said Greg Trotter, a spokesman for the Chicago food bank. “Food manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand” from grocery consumers, he said, “and are therefore selling less food directly to food banks.”
As supplies tighten, demand soars. The Jacobs & Cushman San Diego Food Bank saw the number of people it fed jump from 350,000 to 600,000 in a month, said CEO James A. Floros. A similar demand spike hit Fresno s Central California Food Bank, in the heart of the state s Central Valley - which supplies a quarter of the nation s food, including tomatoes, vegetables, nuts, tree fruits and table grapes.
Restaurant closures were a double hit - putting furloughed workers in the food line and reducing donations from grocers whose shelves were picked clean.
The state’s food-service distributors have scrambled to empty warehouses of bulk products like 50-lb bags of carrots or 21-lb grape bunches that had been destined for restaurants, airlines or cruise ships. Many would donate them, but food banks can’t handle the packages.
""We don t have the ability to unpack it and repack it in family size,"" said Kym Dildine, the Central California Food Bank’s chief administrative officer.
Neither do the charities have the storage, trucks, labor or processing facilities needed to accept and distribute large donations of produce from farmers. When one local farmer recently offered a million heads of lettuce, Dildine could only take a small portion.
Monica White, CEO of Food Share of Ventura County, said the organization has had similar difficulties accepting bulk produce.
“It’s like asking Tesla  to start building gas cars,” she said.
About 300 miles away, in Holtville, California, farmer Jack Vessey had to destroy a crop of fresh-cut romaine lettuce after failing to find a charity to take it.
TAKING ACTION
Jon Samson, an executive director at the American Trucking Association, has been frustrated with the juxtaposition of news images of long food-bank lines with those of farmers destroying food. Over Easter weekend he started pulling together a list of food-industry representatives he believed could get perishable foods to the needy.
The working group of about 80 members includes representatives of trade groups such as the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Restaurant Association, charities including Feeding America and distribution experts such as the American Logistics Aid Network, or ALAN.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, as negative news surrounding Apple  and General Motors  tempered hopes fanned by the partial easing of lockdown measures in New York and Europe.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 173 points or 0.7% at 23,948 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2%.
Apple  stock lagged the market, rising only 0.1%, after it was reported by the Wall Street Journal to be planning a delay of around one month in bringing this year s flagship iPhone models to market. The WSJ said supply chain disruption and the likelihood of subdued customer demand in the near term were responsible.
Elsewhere, General Motors  stock fell 0.7% after the company suspended its buyback program and quarterly dividend in an effort to preserve liquidity. GM, which like other carmakers is suffering from a steep decline in sales with many dealerships across the country closed, also said it had extended a $3.6 billion revolving credit facility.
Rival Tesla  was up 8.1% at a two-month high after Bloomberg reported that it wants to restart its Fremont factory as early as this week. The facility has been shut for the last few weeks due to California s lockdown measures, and its failure to convince the authorities that it is an ""essential"" operation.
Global stocks were also supported by the Bank of Japan s announcement earlier in the day that it would increase its stimulus efforts, while there is also speculation that the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will both announce fresh support measures at their policy meetings later in the week.
Conditions in the oil market continued to be a drag on stocks in general, however. as the front-month U.S. crude futures contract was crushed by more repositioning from the U.S. Oil ETF .

Investing.com – The Dow made a strong start to the week on Monday as the reopening of certain parts of the global economy lifted investor sentiment and triggered a rally in financials as U.S. bond yields surged.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.51%, or 359 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.47%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.11%.
Some states lifted lockdown restrictions over the weekend, with several others expected to follow suit over the coming days and weeks amid signs the Covid-19 outbreak, which has killed more than 50,000 nationwide, is flattening.
The move prompted investors to ditch safe havens in hope that the reopening will boost activity, triggering a jump in U.S. bond yields, which underpinned a rally in financials, mostly banking stocks.
JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America  and  Citigroup   ended up more than 4%.
Energy also caught a bid, shrugging off a more-than-20% plunge in oil prices on rising fears over storage capacity at a time when the coronavirus pandemic continues to hurt demand.
But technology stocks lagged the broader move higher, even as several FAANG names are set to report earnings this week, with Google-parent Alphabet  reporting tomorrow,  Facebook  reporting on Wednesday, Amazon.com  and Apple  on Thursday.
Apple ended the day roughly flat after the tech giant said it was delaying a ramp-up of production by about a month amid the Covid-19 hit to consumer demand and supply chain operations.
Twitter , meanwhile, closed nearly 5% higher ahead of its quarterly numbers due Thursday after Mizuho upgraded the social media company to neutral from underperform on expectations that most of the coronavirus impact was priced in.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Tesla  Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk is on the cusp of a roughly $750 million payday as the electric carmaker s stock recovers from a slump caused by the coronavirus, which led the company to close its factories and furlough workers.
Shares of Tesla surged 10% on Monday ahead of the company s quarterly report this week, and in anticipation it could soon reopen its Fremont, California, plant after it was shuttered because of the pandemic. 
Monday s rally put Tesla s market capitalization at $145 billion. Importantly for Musk, its stock market value reached a six-month average of $96 billion. Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion would trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his two-year-old pay package.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. Taking Monday s Tesla closing stock price of $798.75 as an example, Musk could sell those shares for a profit of $758 million.
Graphic - Elon Musk s options payout: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpweexwpw/Musk%20payout.gif
Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla s market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth. Musk has already hit a growth target necessary for the first options to vest. 
A full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives. 
When Tesla unveiled Musk’s package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds.
The potential payout for Musk comes after Tesla said this month it would furlough all non-essential workers and implement salary cuts during a shutdown of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has slashed U.S. demand for cars and forced several other automakers to also furlough U.S. workers.
Tesla s quarterly report after the bell on Wednesday will show the damage done to global demand by the pandemic and the extent to which a recovery from the coronavirus in China, and a return to production at its Shanghai plant, are helping the U.S. carmaker. 
Investors will also focus on Tesla s cash burn related to its interrupted manufacturing and sales, and on Musk s expectations for consumer demand in a potential long-term global recession, Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a client note last week. The closure of the Fremont plant came just as Tesla was increasing production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle.
Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. That consensus revenue estimate is down from $6.7 billion at the start of February. Analysts on average expect a non-GAAP loss of 36 cents per share. 
When shareholders approved Musk s pay package, Tesla was valued at about $53 billion and it faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals. The pay deal was viewed as massively ambitious because it implied the company s value could grow as much as ten-fold in 10 years, and its potentially huge size led some shareholders to oppose it. 
Tesla s market capitalization since then has expanded to nearly three times the combined values of General Motors  and Ford Motor . 

Musk s subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets pared early gains Tuesday as a barrage of downbeat earnings reports and gloomy economic data curbed the enthusiasm of those betting on a sharp rebound for the U.S. economy next month.  
By 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 130 points, or 1.5% at 24,264, having earlier hit a seven-week high of 24,512 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%, as the froth came out of stocks such as Amazon.com  and Tesla .
The market had earlier appeared to give U.S. Inc a pass on a quarter where results largely reflected business before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, and where visibility regarding the rest of the year has dwindled to near zero. 
Stocks weakened after the sharpest drop in the Conference Board s consumer confidence index in years, down to its lowest level since 2014.  
On a heavy morning for corporate earnings, 3M Company  stock rose 4.2% after the company said a surge in demand for its health-care products (including face-masks) offset a decline in sales at its other divisions, which were all negatively affected by the pandemic. The company said it would cut its capital spending by over 20% this year to preserve cash. 
At the other end of the scale,  United Parcel  Service   stock fell 4.3% after the company was unable to translate a surge in demand for delivery services into higher margins due to an even sharper rise in costs.
Likewise, Merck  stock fell 3.5% after the pharma giant warned that the pandemic could take over $2 billion off full-year sales as health care systems around the world de-prioritize some of the ailments that its best-selling drugs treat - notably its blockbuster Keytruda. The company also suspended its buyback program. 
 Caterpillar   stock rose 1.2% after a quarterly update that added little to existing knowledge, while PepsiCo   stock rose 1.3% after its first quarter was rescued by locked-down consumers  demand for snacks - an element that was missing from rival Coca-Cola  s disappointing update last week.
Elsewhere,  Exxon Mobil   stock rose 2.2% to its highest in seven weeks after the volatility in the U.S. crude futures strip receded. Sentiment towards oil major was helped by the sight of BP  maintaining its quarterly dividend, even at the expense of a sharp rise in debt."

Investing.com - Stocks found direction hard to come by and ended the day in the red after a volatile session today.
Major earnings were mixed after the bell, much like ahead of trading.
Tomorrow morning trading could be subdued until the Federal Reserve decision and subsequent press conference.
But before the bell there will be first-quarter GDP numbers for investors to digest. And the earnings assembly line keeps going.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Outlook in the Spotlight
The Federal Open Market Committee will release its April statement tomorrow at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
No change in rates is expected, so attention will be focused on any guidance the Fed has about the trajectory of the economy.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM ET will also be closely watched.
“As Chair Powell has stated several times, the economic outlook and the policy path will be determined by the virus,” John Velis, FX and Macro Strategist for the Americas at BNY Mellon , wrote in a research note. “Nevertheless we will be expecting some estimates of the amount of economic damage and possible paths of recovery from the FOMC on Wednesday.”
“In addition to some idea regarding the economic outlook, we don t expect the Fed to announce new policy measures, and that includes the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER),” Velis said. “This key rate represents the opportunity cost to banks  borrowing in the Federal Funds Market, and raising it would tend to pull the Federal Funds Rate higher.”
2. GDP Arrives With Expansion Expected to End
Along with the Fed, investors will get their first look at the number on economic growth for the first three months of the year. The numbers capture the tail end of the lockdown of the U.S. economy.
The Commerce Department will reports the advance measure of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that GDP contracted at an annual rate of 4%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would be the biggest contraction since 2009 during the Financial Crisis, which saw contractions of more than 6%. The big damage is expected to be seen in the second quarter, where all but essential services are halted. The economy could contract as much as 65%, according to the most pessimistic estimate, Bloomberg reported.
3. Tesla, Facebook, Microsoft to Report
Among the raft of earnings reports coming tomorrow will be Tesla , which issues numbers after the close of trading.
Last week Bank of America Merrill Lynch  downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral on valuation. Shares are up more than 80% year to date.
“As the macro backdrop has deteriorated so rapidly/severely with the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines and business shutdowns implemented, along with what we expect to be a tepid U-shaped recovery as economies are reopened ... we are once again cutting our global volume forecast,” analyst John Murphy wrote, according to Briefing.com.
Analysts predict a loss of 25 cents per share on revenue of about $6.2 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com
Facebook  will also report postmarket.
The social media giant is seen posting a profit of $1.75 per share and revenue of about $17.4 billion.
Microsoft  will also be issuing quarterly results.
On average, analysts are looking for earnings of $1.29 per share on revenue of about $34 billion."

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve concludes a two-day policy meeting, and U.S. GDP is expected to have contracted by the most in 11 years.  President Donald Trump ordered meat plants to stay open to guarantee the nation s food supply. Unions argued that the move ignored workers  health. Earnings continue to flood in, with Microsoft , Tesla  and Facebook  all due to report after the bell. And oil prices stabilize after weekly inventory data fail to shock. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 29th April. 
1. Trump orders meat plants to stay open
President Donald Trump signed an executive order forcing meat processing plants to continue operating, so as to guarantee food supply.
The order was criticized by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which noted that 20 meatpacking and processing workers have died from coronavirus, and at least 6,500 have been affected.  At least 22 plants processing various meats have been closed at some stage due to the disease.
The tension between health and economic policy continues to play out unevenly across the world. In the U.S., Tennessee and Wisconsin on Wednesday will become the latest states to allow certain smaller businesses to reopen.
Overnight, China eased border restrictions on its citizens, while Poland became the latest European state to relax its lockdown. On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron had bowed to pressure from businesses to announce his country’s lockdown would be mostly lifted on May 11, despite stern warnings of renewed community spread.
2. Fed meeting ends, Powell press conference, GDP data eyed.
The Federal Reserve will conclude a two-day policy meeting at 2 PM ET. No changes to interest rates are expected, given previous statements largely rejecting the notion of negative rates. However, the further tweaks to the central bank’s liquidity operations and quantitative easing program are not ruled out, and the market will also respond to Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments at his press conference at 2:30 PM.
Powell will be able to comment on the first reading for first-quarter GDP, which is expected to have contracted by an annualized 4%, the steepest drop since 2009. The number is highly likely to be revised in subsequent readings and will in any case be dwarfed by the contraction expected for the second quarter.
3. Stocks set to open higher
U.S. stocks are set to open higher after losing momentum late on Tuesday’s session.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 102 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.9%.
The Nasdaq  contract in particular was supported by a well-received quarterly update from Alphabet  after the closing bell on Tuesday, which showed its Internet advertising business holding up well.
European and Asian markets overnight had struggled with some mixed reports from the likes of Samsung (KS:005930) and Airbus but were still mostly higher. U.S. markets face early tests of strength from Boeing  and  General Electric  , both of which are due to report before the open.  
4. Tech earnings to flood in
It’s another heavy day for tech earnings, with Microsoft, Facebook and Qualcomm all set to report after the bell.
However, the spotlight is likely to be hogged by Tesla, whose stock has whipsawed this week on the back of reports that it is trying to reopen its Fremont factory, even though lockdown restrictions are still being widely applied in California.
Tesla rivals Daimler , Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Nissan  all issued updates of varying doom and gloom overnight, although the two German companies’ stocks both rose on indications that they both expect to stay profitable at an operating level this year.
5. Oil recovers; Inventory data due
Crude oil prices extended their recovery after the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. oil stocks rose fractionally less than expected last week.
The API’s estimate of a 10 million-barrel build in crude stocks was slightly less than the 10.6 million expected from today’s data from the government, which are due at 10:30 AM ET."

(Reuters) - When Tesla  Inc reports first-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, many individual shareholders will not be looking for details on the subject that drives most conversations: the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Their view vastly differs from that of traditional analysts and institutional investors, who want to hear updates on Tesla s 2020 cash flow and potential moves to boost demand during a prolonged recession due to the epidemic.
Submitting questions for Tesla s earnings call on a website https://app.saytechnologies.com/tesla?origin=https://ir.tesla.com/events/event-details/tesla-inc-q1-2020-financial-results-and-qa-webcast, retail investors want to learn about Tesla s steps to expand into the robotaxi market, the company s self-driving technology and even plans to create airless tires to reduce maintenance costs.
Of the top 50 questions, only four refer to the novel coronavirus, with one investor asking what safeguards Tesla would implement to protect employees at U.S. factories. Another probed whether Tesla had plans to expand into the grocery delivery market, where demand has skyrocketed during the pandemic.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk early Wednesday morning tweeted ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" and shared an opinion article arguing that severe lockdown orders have not saved many lives, tweeting ""Give people their freedom back.""
Analysts expect Musk to provide details on Tesla s plans to restart factory operations after its only U.S. vehicle factory near San Francisco was forced to close at the end of March. The company originally said it would resume operations on May 4, but Bay Area health officials on Monday extended shelter-in-place orders to the end of May. 
Investors can vote for a particular question on the website and Tesla management generally answers the most popular ones during an earnings call.
Currently, the No. 1 retail investor question is whether Musk will stick to his target for a 50% compound annual growth rate over the next five to 10 years, or whether a 40% target would be more realistic.
Many analysts expect Tesla to have a compound annual growth rate of around 20%. 
Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv, down from an initial February estimate of $6.7 billion. 
Tesla in early April reported strong vehicle deliveries in the first three months of 2020 - a time when other U.S. carmakers grappled with a slump in sales as virus woes and lockdown restrictions began taking hold.

The company in mid-February raised $2 billion in a stock offering, and investors on Wednesday will probe whether that covers the company s cash burn at a time when Tesla ramps up production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle."

Investing.com - Tesla  reported a strong quarter and a surprise profit in the first quarter Wednesday, despite facing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.
The company reported a profit of $1.24 per share on revenue of $5.99 billion
Analysts were looking for a loss of 25 cents per share and revenue of $6.16 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Shares rose 6.7% in after-hours trading.
Revenue was a little light, but the numbers still indicated resilience at a time when the company had to shut down its factories.
“Although impacted by inefficiencies related to the temporary suspension of production and deliveries in many locations, our gross margin remained strong,” Tesla said in a statement.
“Despite the expiration of various government incentives at the end of last year, Q1 was pacing to be the strongest quarter of deliveries until our operations were interrupted in March,” the company said. “As a result, we remain confident in growing global production capacity as quickly as possible.”"

Investing.com - The stock market demonstrated its ability to turn any hopeful news into solid gains today, rallying sharply following a positive report on Gilead’s virus treatment.
And that enthusiasm could follow through tomorrow as big-name postmarket earnings satisfied the bulls.
Tesla , Facebook  and Microsoft  rose in after-hours trading following their results.
Investors shrugged off a sharp contraction in first-quarter GDP reported today, but tomorrow brings the more timely jobless claims numbers.
More big-name earnings arrive as well and it’s ECB decision day.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Rise in Jobless Claims Seen Tempering Again
Jobless claims will be in the spotlight ahead of trading tomorrow, with forecasts expecting them to show another decline in those filing for benefits but to be still at historically high levels.
The Labor Department reports weekly initial jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have risen by 3.5 million, down from a rise of 4.43 million the week before, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. 
Continuing claims are seen rising to about 19.3 million.
At the same time, March personal income and spending data arrive.
Spending is expected to have fallen 5% last month, with income down 1.5%.
2. Another Big Bout of Tech Earnings on Tap
Major tech earnings have so far justified the bullish bets of investors and two more big names will dominate the postmarket results Thursday.
Amazon , expected to be one of the few companies not struggling during the lockdown, reports its results.
Analysts are predicting a profit of $6.34 per share and revenue of about $72 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last week Goldman Sachs  boosted its price target on the stock to $2,900 from $2,600, the high-water market on Wall Street, and said it should report numbers well above the consensus.
“The increase in demand the company s retail, (cloud) and ads businesses is seeing and Amazon s ability to meet the challenges of this demand, will, we believe, serve to steepen the curve of its long term growth rate, drive incremental profitability, and further deepen the competitive moat around all of its businesses,” Goldman analyst Heath Terry said in a note.
Shareholders will also be looking for any response to President Donald Trump s assertions that package delivery companies should be paying much more to use the U.S. Postal Service.
Apple  will also issue its quarterly numbers.
The company is expected to post a profit of $2.31 per share and revenue of about $55 billion.
Apple is reportedly delaying the ramp-up in production of its flagship 2020 iPhones due to demand concerns and manufacturing disruption due to Covid-19.
Twitter  will report ahead of trading, with the consensus calling for a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of about $791 million.
And McDonald’s  will weigh in ahead of trading as well. Analysts predict earnings of $1.60 per share on sales of about $4.7 billion.
Investors will also be looking for ideas as to when the company will start opening up its restaurants.
3. ECB Decision, Press Conference Ahead
Central banks continue to be at the forefront tomorrow as the European Central Bank has its decision day.
The ECB will issue its policy statement at 7:45 AM ET (11:45 GMT).
ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold her press conference soon afterwards at 8:30 AM ET.
The central bank is not expected to make any moves on interest rates or adjustments to its 750 billion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until it gets better clarity on how the easing of lockdown measures is progressing.
Policymakers are also awaiting details from the EU on a potential proposed recovery fund for the coronavirus."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc s  outspoken CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak ""fascist"" as the electric carmaker posted its third quarterly profit in a row.
His remarks overshadowed an otherwise successful quarter that took many investors by surprise as automaker peers were hit by a slump in consumer demand and forced factory shutdowns.
Shares of the company were up 8.8% at $871 in extended trade.
Tesla s profitable quarter comes just a day after Detroit-based rival  Ford Motor Co   reported a $2 billion first-quarter loss and forecast losing another $5 billion in the current quarter as the coronavirus pandemic hits demand.
General Motors Co  on Monday suspended its dividend and share buybacks and will report earnings May 6.
How Tesla fares in the current quarter and the remainder of the year will be an important test of the company s durability. If Tesla can limit its losses, or even continue its profit streak and outperform legacy automakers, it will be in a stronger position to take sales from rivals weakened by the coronavirus disruption.
Tesla produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals but has a much larger stock market value on expectations of tremendous growth.
On the biggest disruptions to Tesla has been the government-ordered shutdown of its factory in Fremont, California, which sits idle since March 24 with stay-at-home orders running until at least May 31. 
On a conference call on Wednesday, Musk said he did not know when Tesla could resume production in California and called the state stay-at-home order a ""serious risk"" to the business.
""To say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom!""
Late on Wednesday, the Tesla CEO doubled down on his stance, in response to a journalist s tweet that quoted Musk s remarks of calling the stay-at-home orders fascist. ""Hell yeah!!"", Musk said on Twitter.
Musk tweeted on March 6 that ""the coronavirus panic is dumb"" but later offered to supply hospitals with free ventilators.
Tesla said it could not predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and global supply chains will normalize, saying it would revisit full-year guidance for net income and cash flow when it reports current-quarter results in three months. 
Musk said that while other carmakers were cutting back, Telsa was ramping up investment. He said Tesla might announce the location of a new U.S. factory in one to three months. 
Tesla in January said it expected positive quarterly cash flow and positive net income going forward. The company on Wednesday did not update its previous forecast of delivering half a million vehicles by the end of 2020. 
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has disrupted demand for cars, with automakers including Tesla forced to furlough workers and close factories. 
Vehicle demand in the United States has dropped as much as 80% in some hard-hit areas in March, but some analysts said sales appeared to recover slightly in April.
Tesla on Wednesday said it expected production at its vehicle factories in Fremont, California and in Shanghai, China to ramp up gradually through the second quarter.
The company said operations at its Shanghai plant were progressing better than expected, with production rates of its Model 3 sedan expected to hit 4,000 units per week, or 200,000 per year, by mid-2020.
Company-wide automotive gross margins in the first quarter jumped to 25.5%.
But of the $5.1 billion in overall automotive revenue, nearly 7% were due to regulatory credits - money Tesla receives from other automakers that buy the company s carbon emissions credits to meet stricter regulation. Revenue from those credits nearly tripled from the last quarter.
 Hargreaves  Lansdown  analyst Nicholas Hyett also flagged that Tesla s free cash flow was negative last quarter and improved only modestly on a yearly basis.
""The immediate future doesn’t look like the ideal time to be selling premium priced cars, so perhaps it’s no surprise guidance has been paused,"" Hyett said.
Tesla said its free cash flow had been impacted by growing inventory due to coronavirus shutdowns.
Tesla shut down the California factory just as it was ramping up production of its new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y, which it expects to generate record demand and higher profit margins. 
Tesla on Wednesday said the Model Y was already contributing profits, marking the first time in the company s history that a new vehicle is profitable in its first quarter.
Excluding items, Tesla posted a profit of $1.24 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 36 cents per share. 
Tesla shares are up 91% for the year to date as of Wednesday s close, after recovering from a sharp slump in March.
The Tesla CEO in particular appeared critical of the coronavirus-related restrictions in California as he agreed with a tweet suggesting the state s hospitals were laying off staff and going bankrupt. He also referenced data saying hospitals in California ""have been half empty"".
Musk seemed to be supportive of the way the lockdown was being lifted in Germany as the European nation began to gradually and tentatively reopen. 

""Very sensible,"" Musk tweeted late on Wednesday responding to a media report on how Germany was lifting its restrictions."

Gilead drug trial  highly significant 
Preliminary results from a U.S. government trial showing that patients given  Gilead Sciences Inc   s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir recovered 31% faster than those given a placebo, have been hailed by Dr. Anthony Fauci as ""highly significant.""
Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, said it will become the standard of care for COVID-19.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it has been in discussions with Gilead about making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible, but the agency declined to comment on any plans to grant the drug regulatory approval.
The closely watched drug, given by intravenous infusion to hospitalized patients, has moved markets in the past few weeks following the release of data from several studies that painted a mixed picture of its effectiveness, and Fauci cautioned that the latest data still needs to be analyzed. 
Lockdowns are  fascist , says Elon Musk
Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk said it was ""fascist"" to say people cannot leave their homes.
""So the extension of the shelter-in-place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, in my opinion, breaking people s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country,"" he said on Tesla  Inc s earnings call, swearing to underscore his point.
""This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom,"" said the outspoken Musk.
In contrast,  Facebook Inc   CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed concern about easing lockdown measures. 
""I worry that reopening certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse longer-term health and economic outcomes,"" Zuckerberg said. 
Australia s biggest drinkers get a date night
Australia s remote Northern  Territory became its first state or territory to detail plans to restart its local economy on Thursday after recording no new cases of the coronavirus for three weeks.
Social gathering limitations for non-contact sport, weddings and funerals will be halted on Friday, restrictions on restaurants and pubs will be eased mid-May and all remaining restrictions are to be removed on June 5. 
""May 15 date night, June 5 Sunday sesh (pub session),"" Chief Minister Michael Gunner said succinctly to reporters in the capital Darwin. The territory has the highest alcohol consumption per person in Australia.
Will people return to shops?
The eyes of the retail world are on Germany, the first major Western economy to have allowed bigger stores to reopen. Will consumers be too worried to go out shopping or primed to unleash pent-up demand?
Global chains including H&M, Adidas , IKEA and Puma are trialling pandemic procedures likely to be used in other markets. Issues include how best to protect staff and disinfect surfaces, as well as how to keep customers a safe distance apart, with changing rooms a particular headache.
Early signs after bigger stores reopened last week show some cause for optimism. Germany s IfW economic institute said that within days shopper traffic in major cities bounced back to about half of what was usual for this time of year. 
Happy Birthday  Colonel  Tom
British World War Two veteran Captain Tom Moore, who has become a national hero after raising almost 30 million pounds for charities that help front-line National Health Service staff, celebrates his 100th birthday on Thursday with an honorary promotion and two military flypasts.
Moore was appointed the first Honorary Colonel of the Army Foundation College, based near the town where he grew up, a position that came with the approval of Queen Elizabeth, the defence ministry said.

He raised the money by completing laps of his garden with the help of a walking frame, having initially set out to raise just 1,000 pounds. That figure means he now holds the Guinness World Record title for the most money raised by an individual through a walk."

(Reuters) - Silicon Valley billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg offered dueling views on lockdown measures designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus on Wednesday, with Facebook s Zuckerberg endorsing the measures while Tesla s Musk condemned them as anti-democratic.
Musk, who has often made outspoken and even inflammatory comments on conference calls and on Twitter, said in comments to analysts on Tesla Inc s  earnings call that it was ""fascist"" to say people cannot leave their homes.
""This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom,"" Musk said.
Zuckerberg, on the other hand, in comments on Facebook s  own earnings calls, expressed concerns about easing lockdown measure and said the economic fallout from the pandemic would last longer than people are currently anticipating. 
""I worry that reopening certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse longer-term health and economic outcomes,"" he said.
Both companies are based in the San Francisco Bay area, which was out front in trying to slow the virus  spread, with the region s seven counties issuing a joint shelter-in-place order before California issued a statewide order.
Electric carmaker Tesla and social media network Facebook have had different experiences under the lockdown. Tesla had initially resisted efforts by California authorities to shut its plant in the Bay Area under the lockdown, until agreeing on March 19 to suspend production. Even so, Tesla on Wednesday reported its third profitable quarter in a row.
Facebook, the world s largest social network, on Wednesday said usage rose during the first quarter amid the widespread lockdowns, although ad revenue plunged in March.
Musk did not mince words in criticizing the lockdowns.
""So the extension of the shelter-in-place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, in my opinion, breaking people s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country,"" Musk said, swearing to underscore his point.
""It will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to any companies. And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not,"" he said.
Zuckerberg and Musk, who is also chief executive of rocket company SpaceX, have had differences in the past. In 2017, a war of words broke out between the duo over whether robots will become smart enough to kill their human creators. 
""I ve talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited."" Musk tweeted at the time about Zuckerberg, who downplayed Musk s warnings about the danger of artificial intelligence.

In May 2018, Musk made waves on another earnings call when he refused to analysts  questions, saying that ""boring, bonehead questions are not cool."" He later apologized for his remarks."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Thursday, consolidating recent gains amid tech sector strength and more hints of policy easing from the Federal Reserve.
At 7:15 AM ET (11:15 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq  futures up 25 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Jones 30 Futures contract fell 37 points, or 0.2%.
The DJIA cash index is on track for its best month since January 1987, while the S&P 500 is looking at its biggest monthly gains since October 1974.
The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged on Wednesday, but expressed a willingness to do more to support the economy if this was needed.
""It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said.
The need for more support could well be illustrated with the release of the latest weekly jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have risen by 3.5 million, down from a rise of 4.43 million the week before. This follows the hefty 4.8% slump in first-quarter gross domestic product, the first time the U.S. economy has contracted in six years.
The U.S. coronavirus death toll has surpassed 60,000, with more than one million confirmed cases, representing about a third of all cases from around the world.
Yet the move to reopen the economy is getting stronger after President Donald Trump said federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus would be “fading out”, putting the onus firmly on the state officials to allow the reopening of businesses.
Optimism has also been driven by positive partial results from a trial of Gilead  s antiviral drug remdesivir, which suggested it could help speed recovery from Covid-19.
The corporate earnings season continues Thursday, with the likes of McDonald’s reporting early and tech giants Amazon  and Apple  after the close.
Staying with the tech sector, shares in Facebook  traded over 9% higher premarket as the social media giant reported late Wednesday that its ad sales stabilized in recent weeks, part of a strong earnings report.
Microsoft s  shares climbed 2.6% premarket after the company reported fiscal third-quarter sales growth of 15% after Wednesday’s close, fueled by its cloud business.
Tesla s  shares climbed 8% premarket after surprising with a first-quarter profit amid the broad economic destruction wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil futures pushed higher Thursday, helped by stockpiles of U.S. crude rising less than expected last week - in a clear weakening of the recent trend.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 17% higher at $17.62 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 8.3% to $26.24.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1% to $1,729.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0877, largely flat."

(Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages gave a resounding thumbs-up to Tesla Inc s  first-quarter numbers on Thursday, lauding the electric carmaker s improved gross margins and sending its shares 8% higher in trading before the opening bell.
Slipping into profanity on a call with analysts after the results on Wednesday, Musk called current stay-at-home orders ""fascist"" and said it was a serious risk to the business. 
His remarks come around a year after Tesla managed to end a series of legal and regulatory rows over Musk s social media posting by agreeing restrictions with regulators.
A morning round of research notes from major investment banks saw analysts avoid the issue and focus on the fundamentals of Tesla s business.
Analysts with J.P. Morgan said important take-aways, included its ""unexpectedly higher"" regulatory credits of $354 million in the quarter.
Regulatory credits is the money Tesla receives from other automakers that buy the company s carbon emissions credits to meet stricter regulation.
""The highlight of the result was a solid gross margin beat,""  Credit Suisse   analysts wrote, saying gross margins on both the Model Y compact utility vehicle and its China-made Model 3 had come as a positive surprise.
Tesla s market cap currently stands at around $147.38 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The company s third profit beat in a row comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has hammered auto sales and production in the United States. 
Canaccord Genuity said the strong gross margin at 20.6% was proof of ""a meaningful operational improvement that the company has made over the past several quarters"".
Company-wide automotive gross margins in the first quarter jumped to 25.5%.
Tesla said on Wednesday it would revisit its outlook for net income and cash flow in its next quarterly earnings.
Another brokerage, Wedbush, predicted that Tesla would miss its 2020 vehicle delivery target of 500,000, saying it was a ""virtual impossibility"" that the carmaker would hit those numbers, given the worldwide slump in demand. 

""Although the rest of the world is essentially shutdown and in lockdown mode, strong Model 3 demand out of China remains a ray of light for Tesla in a dark global macro,"" the brokerage said. "

McDonald’s  stock was down 2.0% after a quarterly update that fell short of expectations. Most of its restaurants limited their services to delivery, drive-thru and take-away in the quarter to curb the spread of Covid-19.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday, retracing some of Wednesday s gains after another big rise in initial jobless claims dented optimism about a quick recovery for the economy.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said another 3.84 million filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, above expectations of 3.5 million but still a fourth straight weekly drop. Continuing claims at 17.99 million were below expectations but still a record high for recent history.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 220 points or 0.9% at 24,414 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, losing only 0.1%, insulated by stronger-than-expected quarterly updates on Wednesday evening from large caps Microsoft , Facebook  and Tesla . 
Gains were concentrated in the megacaps, with most of the rest of the market running out of steam after a relief rally that many say has baked in too optimistic a recovery scenario.
Facebook stock was up 6.6% after the social media giant reported that advertising revenue stabilized in April, supported by e-commerce and gaming companies aiming to cash in on the inability of the public to get out of the house for either recreation or shopping. 
Microsoft stock rose 1.0% after the software giant reported an across-the-board increase in revenue and a rise in earnings. Demand for its cloud hosting business Azure was a particular beneficiary of businesses  need to do more of their stuff online. Tesla, which reported a surprise profit for the quarter late on Wednesday, was also up 6.1%, despite not being able to name a date for the reopening of its Fremont factory (much to the disgust of its CEO Elon Musk).
On the busiest day of the earnings season, however, there were just as many low points. McDonald’s  stock fell 2.3% after reporting a 6% drop in quarterly sales, while Macy’s  couldn t get a break even after announcing it aims to reopen 68 of its stores from Monday, and the rest of its chain within six weeks. Macy s stock fell 3.0%.
Zoom Video  fell 7.2% as the signs of economic reopening took away what the lockdowns had given, while the biggest decline was in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) ADRs, which tumbled over 11% as the company cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War. The stock got no support from another sharp rise in U.S. crude prices as traders moved to price in an easing of the supply/demand imbalance. "

Investing.com - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn tweeted out Thursday another letter sent to Tesla  CEO Elon Musk questioning the automaker’s financial results.
Greenlight Capital founder Einhorn, who tweeted out a letter in November questioning whether Tesla’s accounts receivable “even exist,” tweeted out another letter today asking for explanations about its auto gross margin reported yesterday.
“This quarter your production was lower and split across two factories, affecting cost absorption, particularly in Fremont,” Einhorn wrote. “Your average selling price was lower. Your mix had fewer high margin models S/X. You ramped up Model Y. Both factories were interrupted driving up costs. And, though you didn’t discuss it, currency should have hit your margin 2-3% compared to last quarter.”
“All of these factors appear to be headwinds to your auto gross margin (excluding Regulatory credit sales) – which barely budged,” he said.
Tesla reported first-quarter auto gross margin of 25.5%, up from 22.5% in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Tesla rose 4.3% in morning trading."

Taking to Twitter on Thursday, Einhorn asked Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk and chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla s accounts receivable, costs, idled factories and the impact of currency market movements on the company. 
""Can you or (Zack) explain,"" Einhorn wrote, misspelling the CFO s first name in the tweet. Without answers, the investor added, he would continue to wonder ""if not only your accounts receivable are suspect, but your income statement as well.""
Einhorn has 48,000 followers on Twitter and his message hit a nerve after Musk on Wednesday overshadowed his company s strong first quarter results with comments about stay-at-home restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. Musk called for an end to California s stay-at-home orders, describing them as ""fascist"" and a ""serious risk"" to his business.
The hedge fund manager s Thursday tweet was retweeted nearly 700 times and liked more than 2,500 times. Representatives for Einhorn and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Einhorn and Musk have a history of taunting each other on social media. 
Greenlight Capital s Einhorn has long bet that Tesla s share price would drop, holding onto a view that has hurt his portfolio. In January, Einhorn told his investors in a letter that his negative view on Tesla is reflected by his purchase of put options. In the first quarter Greenlight Capital lost 21.5%, an investor said. 
Tesla reported a first quarter profit of $1.24 per share, beating analysts  forecasts for a loss of 36 cents per share. Strong demand for its Model 3 vehicle and the sale of regulatory credits helped fuel the gain. Tesla s share price has surged 91% since January, recovering quickly from a sharp slump in March when stocks tumbled amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak.

The reopening of the economy has stoked some investor hopes the downturn in the economy may not be as bad as many fear, but the ongoing surge in jobless claims and signs the consumer is trouble has weighed on sentiment.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by 3.8 million, compared with 4.4 million last week, missing economists  forecasts of 3.5 million.

The grim economic background overshadowed a surge in large-cap tech stocks, led by Facebook, as investors cheered bullish earnings.
Facebook  rose 4.5% after the social media giant reported revenue that topped consensus estimates and said it was seeing signs of stability in ad revenue after a coronavirus-led slowdown in March.

By Joey Rouelette
(Reuters) - NASA on Thursday selected space firms SpaceX, Blue Origin and Dynetics to build lunar landing systems that can carry astronauts to the moon by 2024, the White House s accelerated deadline under the space agency s moon-to-Mars campaign.
The three companies, which include firms of tech billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, will share $967 million from NASA, though specific amounts each company will receive were not immediately known.
 Boeing Co   proposed a lander concept last year but was not selected.
""This is the last piece that we need in order to get to the moon,"" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told reporters on Thursday, calling the agency s first lunar lander procurement since 1972 ""historic"".
Unlike the Apollo program that put astronauts on the moon nearly 50 years ago, NASA is gearing up for a long-term presence on Earth s satellite that the agency says will eventually enable humans to reach Mars, leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration. 
Picking three providers allows NASA to have redundancy in case one company falls behind in development, Lisa Watson-Morgan, NASA s human landing system program manager, told reporters on Thursday. 
""I think we ve got the potential for an incredibly exciting future in space with a base on the moon, and ultimately sending people and having a self-sustaining city on Mars,"" Musk, who also leads electric car firm Tesla , said Thursday. 
Last year, Bezos unveiled Blue Origin s design for the lunar lander, Blue Moon, it intends to build as a prime contractor with  Lockheed Martin  ,  Northrop Grumman   and Draper. Blue Origin plans to launch its landing system using its own heavy-lift rocket, New Glenn. 
Musk s SpaceX, which is on the cusp of launching its first manned mission for NASA next month, will develop its Starship landing system to send crew and up to 100 pounds of cargo to the moon. 
Dynetics, a unit of  Leidos Holdings  Inc , develops human landing system, which the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture, United Launch Alliance, will launch on its Vulcan system.
BOEING NOT PICKED
Cutting Boeing out of a key NASA spaceflight effort deals a blow to the aerospace giant s space wing, which for decades has been a key International Space Station contractor and more recently a secondary provider in NASA s efforts to launch humans to the station under its Commercial Crew Program.
NASA said it removed Boeing and another company as bidders for the lunar lander award early on in the selection process, though a specific reason was not immediately clear.
Last month, Boeing lost to competitor SpaceX in a separate competition for cargo delivery services to a lunar space station, with NASA saying in a memo ""Boeing s proposal was the highest priced and the lowest rated under the Mission Suitability factor.""
NASA in recent months has been quicker to call out Boeing for its fumbles on various agency programs, such as delays in its heavy-lift rocket Space Launch System that remains years behind schedule, billions over budget and has suffered dozens of engineering setbacks.

The Space Launch System, which has not yet flown, is currently NASA s ride for transporting humans off Earth and to the moon by 2024, but the rocket s debut mission has already slipped back a year into 2021."

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc  tumbled 9% on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker s high-flying stock was overly expensive.
""Tesla stock price is too high,"" Musk said on Twitter in one of several unusual messages, including ones quoting parts of the U.S. national anthem and that he would sell almost all his physical possessions. 
The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla s market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk s stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April.
More than two hours after the tweets began, Tesla had not responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had responded to an email asking whether he was joking or whether his tweet was vetted by saying, ""No"".
Musk has a history of sending provocative tweets. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private at a big premium, which led a fraud case by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk settled by agreeing to pay $20 million and have a Tesla lawyer pre-screen tweets with important information about the company.
Last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Musk intended to defraud them.
In April 2019 Musk tweeted, ""My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point.""
""We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek and it’s Elon being Elon. It’s certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and the Street clearly is frustrated,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said by email. 
Tesla s stock has surged in recent weeks, but is down since Wednesday after the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Musk s latest tweets follow others this week. On Tesla s quarterly conference call on Wednesday, he called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak ""fascist"". Those restrictions have forced Tesla to shutter its car plant in Fremont, California.
""Musk has recently expressed some strong and, at times, controversial, views on COVID-19 and some elements of the response to the crisis and we believe is attempting to use his broad following and visibility to bring attention to some economic factors that he believes may be overlooked,""  Morgan Stanley   analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a client note on Friday.
Musk s iconoclastic stance has helped him attract over 33 million followers on Twitter and is seen as a marketing boon for Tesla.

Tesla s recent rally has put Musk on the verge of a payday of over $700 million. The six-month average of Tesla s market capitalization is just short of $100 billion, a target that would trigger the vesting of a tranche of options granted to Musk to buy 1.69 million shares as part of his two-year-old pay package."

Investing.com – The Dow declined on Friday, paced by declines in Amazon and Apple, after their earnings reports failed to live up to investor expectations, and fresh worries over U.S.-China tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.37%, the S&P 500 lost 2.76%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.07%.
With many seeing the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic in the rearview mirror, investors sentiment was dealt a blow as President Donald Trump renewed the prospect of a fresh U.S.-China conflict.  
Trump insisted Beijing would be held accountable for its role in the pandemic after alleging that the virus originated from a lab in China.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told CNBC there was ""no question"" Trump would follow through on his threat.
On the earnings front, Amazon.com  fell 6.6% after the e-commerce giant late Thursday reported lower first-quarter earnings and said it expected an operating loss of $1.5 billion to an operating income of $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to a jump in Covid-19-related expenses.
Apple , meanwhile, fell 1%, after reporting flat revenue growth. It did not offer guidance for the June quarter, citing coronavirus uncertainty.
Newell Brands , meanwhile, slumped 10% after the manufacturer reported a decline in quarterly earnings and revenue.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a climb in oil prices as major oil-producing countries got their agreed output cuts underway in a bid to offset falling demand."

Investing – The Dow ended the week on a sour note, as investor sentiment was rocked by fresh U.S.-China worries as President Donald Trump threatened action against Beijing over the Covid-19 pandemic.
The {{169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} fell 2.55%, the S&P 500 lost 2.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.2%.
Trump suggested that his administration could place tariffs on China or cancel part of its debt obligations to Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus, claiming to have evidence showing the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The threat of new tariffs on China stoked investor jitters about a fresh U.S.-China trade war, overshadowing some of recent optimism over the partial reopening of the U.S.
The lockdown measures to contain the outbreak have wreaked havoc on the economy, wiping out all the jobs created since the financial crisis and pushing the economy to contract by more 4% in the first quarter, with fears running high that a prolonged recession looms.
With a vaccine still at the minimum months away, drugmakers are in a race against time to produce Covid-19 treatments that can support efforts to get the wheels of the economy turning once again, with Gilead s  remdesivir leading the pack.
The Food and Drug Administration granted the drug emergency use authorization, President Donald Trump said Friday, according to CNBC.
The latest data on manufacturing activity, however, was better than feared, though the sector continued to remain in contraction.
The impact of the virus has also been evident across quarterly earnings reports as companies have pulled guidance, citing coronavirus-led uncertainty.
Amazon.com  fell 7.4% after the e-commerce giant late Thursday reported lower first-quarter earnings and said it expected an operating loss of $1.5 billion to an operating income of $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to a jump in Covid-19-related expenses.
Apple , meanwhile, fell 1.6%, after reporting flat revenue growth and ditching its custom of proving guidance for the June.
Newell Brands  slumped 11.4% after the manufacturer reported a decline in quarterly earnings and revenue.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a climb in oil prices as major oil-producing countries got their agreed output cuts underway in a bid to offset falling demand."

""For furloughed employees, unless you are contacted by your manager about a start date, you will remain on furlough until further notice, at least for another week,"" the company s in-house counsel Valerie Capers Workman said in the email, which was sent to employees and seen by Reuters.
Tesla suspended production at its Fremont, California plant on March 24.
The extension comes days after health officials from San Francisco County, along with five other Bay Area counties, said they would revise ""shelter-in-place"" orders that are set to expire on Sunday. 
The new orders will keep the restrictions in place and extend them through May, with limited easing for a small number of low-risk activities.
The company was not immediately available to a Reuter s request for comment.
The electric carmaker last month furloughed all non-essential workers and implemented salary cuts during a shutdown of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak.

The purpose of the licence from the energy regulator may be to introduce the company s Autobidder platform, the report said, citing a company source. The application did not make clear why Tesla has applied for the licence, The Telegraph reported.
Autobidder is a platform for automated energy trading and is currently being operated at Tesla s Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia.
Having built a significant battery business in recent years, the carmaker is now preparing to enter the British market with its technology, the paper said, citing industry sources.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. 
In 2017, the carmaker built world s largest lithium ion battery to help keep the lights on in South Australia.

(Reuters) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared to qualify on Monday for a $700 million payday, just three days after he said the electric car company s stock price was too high.
Shares of Tesla Inc  jumped more than 8% on Monday, putting Tesla s market capitalization at $141.1 billion at the close. More importantly for Musk, Tesla s stock market value reached a six-month average of $100.2 billion, according to an analysis of Refinitiv data.
Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion triggers the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of a pay package agreed in 2018. Musk has already met two other requirements by hitting a growth target and far exceeding a one-month average $100 billion market cap.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla s closing stock price of $761.19, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares for a profit of $694 million.
Musk on Friday said on Twitter, ""Tesla stock price is too high imo,"" using an abbreviation for ""in my opinion"".
That tweet sent Tesla s stock tumbling 10%, shocking shareholders. Tesla, whose California factory is closed as part of the state s coronavirus-related lockdowns, posted its third quarterly profit in a row last week.
Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla s market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth. 
A full payoff of all tranches would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives.
When Tesla unveiled Musk’s package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds.

Musk s subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets."

DETROIT (Reuters) - The union that represents U.S. hourly workers at Detroit automakers gave its tacit approval on Tuesday for the companies to restart production amid the coronavirus pandemic, after  Fiat  Chrysler said it expected to reopen its North American plants on May 18.
The United Auto Workers union has been negotiating with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA)  , General Motors Co  and  Ford Motor Co   over how and when to safely restart U.S. production after widespread lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""We continue to advocate for as much testing (for the disease) as possible at the current time and eventually full-testing when available,"" UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement. ""As for the start date, the companies contractually make that decision and we all knew this day would come.""
FCA said as it reported its first-quarter results that it expected to restart its North American operations on May 18.
GM and Ford have not announced restart dates, but the Detroit companies want to resume production so they can start bringing in much-needed cash. 
U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of cases of the novel coronavirus jumped. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states reopening their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can safely restart.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer previously extended the state s stay-at-home order through May 15, but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday, and Whitmer is facing increasing calls to follow suit. 
Tesla Inc  Chief Executive Elon Musk was highly critical last week of the various states  stay-at-home orders, which have idled the electric carmaker s California plant. He called the policies ""fascist."" 
Ford said on Tuesday it had not determined when to restart North American production. 
""We are continuing to assess public health conditions, government guidelines and supplier readiness to determine when the time is right to resume production,"" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in an email.
Last week, Ford outlined the safety measures it will institute to restart its U.S. plants and said getting clearance from Michigan would be the last step. GM and FCA have instituted similar measures at their plants.
GM officials could not immediately be reached to comment.
Gamble, who had previously said early May was ""too soon and too risky"" to resume production, said his own family would be among those reporting to plants. His previous rule for automakers was asking whether they felt it was safe enough to send their own family members into plants.
Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said last week he would ""absolutely"" be comfortable having his family working at a Ford plant, given the steps taken to ensure employee safety.
""We must implement and follow these guidelines and self-reporting procedures we have worked out,"" Gamble said on Tuesday, referring to guidelines on worker health and safety. 

""And the UAW will fulfill its role to continue to actively monitor and aggressively respond regarding all issues impacting the health and safety of UAW members in whatever manner may be necessary as we return to the worksite.”"

""NASA is excited to work with @TomCruise on a film aboard the @Space_Station!,"" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote on Twitter.
""We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists to make @NASA’s ambitious plans a reality,"" Bridenstine added.
He gave no details but the tweet followed a report in Hollywood trade outlet Deadline that Cruise was working with Tesla  and SpaceX entrepreneur Elon Musk to make what would be the first feature film to be shot in space.
The proposed action adventure is in its early stages, Deadline reported on Monday.
Representatives for Cruise did not immediately return a request for comment.
""Mission: Impossible"" star Tom Cruise, 57, is renowned for his daredevil films and for doing his own stunts. He flew fighter jets for the upcoming ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" hung off the side of a plane as it took off in ""Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation"" in 2015 and climbed the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai - the tallest building in the world - for ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol.""
Filming on ""Mission: Impossible 7"" was put on hold in February as the coronavirus epidemic took off in Italy. The disease later led to a worldwide shutdown of Hollywood movie and TV production and the closure of movie theaters.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Investors want to know what kind of economic hit General Motors Co  expects from the coronavirus pandemic as it moves forward, whether it needs to raise further cash and when North American vehicle production will resume when it reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. 
The Detroit automaker has slashed costs and made other moves during the COVID-19 outbreak, including suspending its dividend and share buybacks, closing its Maven car-sharing unit, delaying work on some product programs, reducing marketing budgets and cutting white-collar workers  salaries. It also added $16 billion to its cash position by drawing down credit lines.
GM also has suspended its 2020 profit outlook given the uncertainty.
Smaller U.S. rival  Ford Motor Co   last month raised another $8 billion from corporate debt investors to further shore up its finances after previously drawing down its credit lines.
GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara warned employees in an internal video on March 26 that ""significant austerity measures"" were necessary to avoid ""serious damage"" to GM s long-term viability. 
One ray of hope has been China, where the pandemic began but where GM has resumed production. While first-quarter sales there fell 43%, they rebounded to grow by double digits in April. That offers hope for the U.S. market, where sales declined 7% in the first quarter. 
U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states reopening their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can safely restart.
GM, Ford and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA)   are aiming to resume production some time in May and are negotiating with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents their U.S. hourly workers, about when and how to safely restart. 
The Detroit automakers are anxious to end the cash burn that has occurred during the shutdown. While FCA said Tuesday it expects most of its North American plants to reopen by May 18, GM and Ford have not announced restart dates. 
The UAW said last month that it was ""too soon and too risky"" to reopen plants in early May. President Rory Gamble said last week the union was asking for ""as much testing as possible"" to protect its workers.
In its restart playbook, GM s strategy relies heavily on social distancing, temperature checks, regular sanitizing, improved plant ventilation and use of personal protective equipment, but does not address assembly line workstations.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer previously extended the state s stay-at-home order through May 15 but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday. 
Once production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand rebounds, with some dealers expecting big discounts to lure consumers back to showroom floors. 
Some industry officials have said some level of government stimulus for the U.S. auto sector will be needed for consumers once the pandemic recedes.
During the Great Recession of 2008-09, the U.S. government rolled out a ""cash for clunkers"" program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers.
Other U.S. automakers already outlined the pain caused by the crisis.
FCA on Tuesday reported a first-quarter loss of $1.8 billion, said it expected a significant loss in the second quarter and scrapped its full-year profit outlook.
Last week, Ford said its second-quarter loss would more than double to over $5 billion from $2 billion in the first quarter. Executives said the current economic environment was too unpredictable to offer a full-year profit outlook.

Also last week, Tesla Inc  reported its third consecutive profitable quarter, but the results were overshadowed by Chief Executive Elon Musk, who described as ""fascist"" the sweeping U.S. stay-at-home orders that have idled the electric carmaker s California plant. "

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW AG  expects the coronavirus pandemic to hit demand and earnings throughout this year, prompting the German automaker to cut its profitability forecast for passenger cars following a drop in first-quarter deliveries. 
The firm forecast a margin on automotive earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 0% to 3% this year, versus the 2-4% seen before demand was crippled by worldwide restrictions on movement to tackle the virus.
""The BMW Group still expects the spread of the coronavirus and the necessary containment measures to seriously dampen demand across all major markets over the entire year,"" the Munich-based company said on Wednesday.
BMW reported a 133% jump in first-quarter profit to 1.38 billion euros ($1.50 billion). But that was against a period last year when earnings were pushed down to 589 million euros by a one-off 1.4 billion euro provision.
The automotive EBIT margin came in at 1.3%.
Jefferies  automotive analyst Philippe Houchois described the margin as disappointing, given solid sales of typically more profitable sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).
BMW expects to make an operating loss in the second quarter as coronavirus lockdowns continue in large markets like the United States and Britain, it said. 
Like rivals, BMW also said it would throttle back investments to preserve cash. A 12 billion euros cost savings and efficiency plan will be extended, it added, without providing further details.
""In light of the current situation, we will be delaying a number of projects, like the plant in Hungary. Other projects will be carefully reconsidered,"" Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said, adding the Hungary plant would be delayed by a year.
Free cashflow at the automotive business was minus 2.2 billion euros in the first quarter and BMW said it no longer expected to achieve positive free cash flow in 2020, despite cutting back investments.
At 0845 GMT, its shares were down 2.9% at 51.99 euros.
CHALLENGES 
BMW s forecasts are the latest sign that profitability at traditional automakers is on the wane, as they spend huge sums to clean up combustion engines in the face of increasingly stringent emissions regulations as well as rising competition from electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc . 
Last week, Tesla said its automotive gross margin rose to 25.5% in the first quarter from 20.2% a year earlier, due to a 40% rise in deliveries, helped by demand for its Model Y crossover utility vehicle.
By contrast, BMW s passenger car deliveries fell 20.6% to 477,111 cars in a quarter blighted by the virus outbreak.
The company also said it had set aside a ""low triple digit million"" euros amount to cover potential defaults from customers buying cars on loans and leasing contracts.
BMW has had to ramp up spending on hybrid petrol-electric and pure electric vehicles to try to meet emissions rules and offset its heavy reliance on petrol-guzzling SUVs.
Sales of BMW s ""X"" series of SUVs jumped 21% last year, making up 44% of the BMW brand s global total. 
Carbon dioxide emissions from new vehicles sold in the European Union must be 40% lower in 2021 compared with 2007, and 37.5% lower in 2030 versus 2021 - with fines for non-compliance.

BMW s 2021 target is an EU fleet average of 102.5 grams of CO2 per kilometre. Last year, its average fell just 1 gram from a year earlier to 127 grams, while research and development spending left its automotive EBIT margin at 4.9%."

Invesco  QQQ Trust Series 1, which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, is poised to hit that closing milestone for the first time since it began trading in 1999. It’s already hit that level in regular market hours. The ETF extended a rally from its March low to over 30% on Thursday as a broader tech-heavy gauge erased its year-to-date drop amid gains in giants such as Apple Inc .,  Microsoft Corp  . and  Facebook Inc  .
Read: Nasdaq Composite Erases 2020 Losses as Big Earnings Drive Gains
Investors are picking technology as a safe corner at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is causing so many uncertainties for global markets. Tech behemoths, known for their strong balance sheets and high growth, have counterbalanced the gloom and doom affecting many other industries. With millions of people around the world stuck in their home offices to help contain the outbreak, companies that specialize in remote-working products are becoming a hot spot.
“It’s a sector now that’s just resilient,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade . “The conditions we’re in right now, companies need to keep operating -- they just need to do it remotely. And that benefits a lot of these tech companies.”
While the Nasdaq Composite Index turned green for 2020 on Thursday, broader gauges such as the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average remained lower for the year by at least 10%. All three major benchmarks have surged from their March lows, but technology is the only S&P 500 group that’s up for 2020.
That preference for tech is visible in the ETF world. After posting its best month of inflows since 2001 in March, QQQ added another $3.2 billion in April and $367 million so far in May. The fund rose 1.6% at 2:17 p.m. in New York -- on track for its highest close since Feb. 21.
“Investors may recognize that the constituents of QQQ’s benchmark, the Nasdaq 100, are well positioned to capitalize on the current shift to digital working and learning, potential advancements in biotech and healthcare along with a number of transformative, long-term themes in the marketplace,” said Ryan McCormack, Invesco QQQ strategist.
Only four other ETFs are currently above $100 billion -- SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY ; iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, or IVV; Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, or VTI; and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or VOO.
Despite QQQ’s rally, traders are increasingly looking to bet against the fund. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on QQQ -- a rough indicator of bearish bets on the fund -- climbed to 5.1% on Wednesday, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s up from about 2.7% on March 23.
“The thing we haven’t seen yet with tech names is how badly advertising is going to be hit,” said Marc Odo, client portfolio manager at Swan Global Investments. “Those companies are going to have to plug the gaps or their earnings are going to take a hit.”
Still, solid first-quarter earnings from Google parent Alphabet  Inc., Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla  Inc. have contributed to momentum -- at least for now."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a podcast interview released on Thursday that the company s planned Roadster sports car would take a backseat to the development of other vehicle models.
Talking with stand-up comic Joe Rogan, the billionaire also doubled down on his critique of stay-at-home orders imposed by U.S. states to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
Musk said states  lockdown orders were ""unconstitutional"" and would not hold up before the U.S. Supreme Court if challenged. He previously made such remarks during Tesla s first-quarter earnings call on April 29, calling restrictions ""fascist.""
The interview marked Musk s second appearance on Rogan s podcast, which is videotaped and published online. Musk became infamous when he smoked a marijuana joint with Rogan during the first interview in September 2018.
When Rogan asked when he could buy a Roadster, Musk responded he could not provide a date, but said other initiatives, including a ramp-up in production of sport utility vehicle Model Y and the construction of a vehicle factory in Berlin, were priorities.
""Roadster is kind of like dessert,"" Musk said. ""We gotta get the meat and potatoes and greens and stuff.""
Musk also said Tesla should produce the Cybertruck, a futuristic-looking light commercial vehicle, before working on the Roadster.
Tesla announced the Roadster, a battery-powered four-seater, at the end of 2017 and at the time said the car would be faster than any street-legal production car. Musk in the past has said Roadster sales would begin after a revised version of its Model S sedan is released, which was widely expected to be at the end of 2020.

Musk told Rogan those devices could be implanted in people within a year, but said he would have a Neuralink implanted in himself only if it actually works."

But Tesla is located in one of the San Francisco Bay Area counties, Alameda, that have a separate lockdown scheduled to last until the end of May. Under that county order, Tesla s only U.S. vehicle factory, in Fremont, California, is not allowed to operate regularly.
The state order announced on Thursday does not supersede the county plan, Alameda Sheriff s Office spokesman Ray Kelly told Reuters by text message.
The state plan outlined by the governor includes several requirements for reopening, such as implementing physical distancing, screening workers and training employees on limiting spread of the virus.
Musk has criticized the lockdown and has been eager to reopen the Tesla factory. Musk is also CEO of rocket and spacecraft company SpaceX.

DETROIT/SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Michigan and California, two U.S. manufacturing powerhouses, acted on Thursday to allow factories to reopen from coronavirus lockdowns over the next few days, as millions more Americans joined the ranks of workers left jobless by the pandemic.
Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan gave the go-ahead to manufacturers in her state to restart on May 11, removing a major obstacle to North American automakers seeking to bring thousands of idled employees back to work this month.
The U.S. auto sector accounts for 6% of U.S. economic output, with more than 835,000 Americans employed in vehicle manufacturing. 
Whitmer, however, extended her stay-at-home order for two more weeks to avoid a new wave of coronavirus infections in an industrial Midwestern state hard hit by the virus and by business closures.
Whitmer had held off easing the state s lockdown, drawing protests and hampering efforts to restart vehicle assembly anywhere in the United States because key parts suppliers are based in and around Michigan s automaking hub of Detroit.
""We re not out of the woods yet, but this is an important step forward,"" the governor, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement.
Mexico is another link in the chain. If it does not allow suppliers to restart, automakers will not be able to resume most U.S. production for more than a few days, auto executives said.
The Mexican government aims to inform the public on Monday of its plans to reopen the auto industry, a senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In California, fellow Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled rules permitting manufacturers in his state - ranging from makers of computers, electronics and textiles to aerospace and chemical plants - to reopen as early as Friday. 
His order also gave the OK for warehouse and logistics facilities to return to work, and for retail businesses to offer curbside service.
Newsom, the first U.S. governor to halt most commercial activity in his state - on March 19 - said sufficient progress had been made in reducing California s infection rate to allow for a safe, gradual economic reopening.
Companies, however, are required to meet criteria such as physical distancing of staff, coronavirus testing for employees and workplace training on hygiene and infection control.
Newsom s move drew an enthusiastic ""Yeah!!"" on Twitter from Tesla Inc  chief executive Elon Musk, though the only assembly plant for his electric car-making business is in Alameda County, one of several San Francisco Bay-area jurisdictions whose more stringent lockdown runs through May.
Musk s rocket company, SpaceX, may benefit more immediately, as its manufacturing facility is based just outside Los Angeles.
Michigan s announcement came three days after neighboring Ohio, also a key player in the auto industry, allowed manufacturers to reopen on Monday, adding to the clamor for Whitmer to follow suit. 
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced further steps on Thursday to permit bars, restaurants, hair salons and other personal care businesses to open this month with social-distancing limits.

DEPRESSION-ERA JOBLESSNESS
Several weeks of widespread business shutdowns meant to curb the contagion have dealt a staggering blow to the U.S. economy, casting Americans out of work in numbers unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s and stoking pressure on politicians to lift restrictions.
The U.S. Labor Department reported on Thursday 33.5 million workers have filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits the past six weeks. Its closely-watched monthly jobs report was due out on Friday, with April s unemployment rate expected to shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% set in November 1982.
""I feel like the government is failing us,"" said Claudia Alejandra, who lost her job at a department store makeup counter in Orlando, Florida, on March 28 and now spends her days trying to secure unemployment benefits that should have arrived weeks ago. 
The bleak jobs figures add to a litany of gloomy reports on consumer spending, business investments, trade, housing and productivity. 
The toll on human lives has likewise been staggering. Nearly 76,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, out of more than 1.26 million known to be infected, according to a Reuters tally.
Michigan, Ohio and California were among dozens of U.S. states moving to ease constraints on social and business life, despite a lack of vastly expanded diagnostic testing and other safeguards called for under White House guidelines issued in April.
GUIDELINES SHELVED
News surfaced on Thursday the White House has shelved a more recent set of guidelines prepared by U.S. health officials to help states determine the safest ways to reopen mass transit, restaurants, daycare centers and other public places.
The 17-page document prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was rejected because it gave ""overly prescriptive"" guidance, a member of the White House coronavirus task force said, confirming a report by the Associated Press.
The CDC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
But Dr. Deborah Brix, a task force coordinator, later told CNN: ""No one has stopped those guidelines. We re still in editing.""
Public health experts warn that reopening prematurely risks unleashing new outbreaks. They have also raised concerns a state-by-state hodgepodge of differing policies confuses the public and undermines social distancing generally. 
In New York and New Jersey, the country s two hardest-hit states, bars and retail businesses deemed non-essential remain closed, and restaurants are limited to takeout and delivery business. In Georgia and Texas, most retail and dine-in restaurants are open, albeit with restrictions on how many people can be served and how close tables may be to one another.
Trump, who had staked his November re-election bid to the strength of the U.S. economy before the pandemic, has continued to press for an escalation of commerce, acknowledging - as predicted by researchers - it may cost lives.
Yet, it remains to be seen how many consumers will venture back into restaurants and shops in the midst of a pandemic.
In one indication of public wariness, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, Raphael Bostic, told reporters on Thursday preliminary cellphone tracking data showed that ""movement has not gone up appreciably"" among consumers.
""Whether having an open economic policy is going to translate into economic activity - we are going to learn this in the next couple of weeks,"" he said.

China s exports rebound has been quickly overshadowed by dire predictions of Trade War II between the world s two biggest economies. 
Markets are hoping Donald Trump s threats to penalise China for COVID-19 are pandering to Americans  fear of China during an election year. After all, neither side can afford to further knock business confidence at a time when the world faces the worst economic contraction on record. 
In response to U.S. talk of slapping on more tarriffs, stopping U.S. pension money from investing in China and even stripping it of sovereign immunity, China has only offered verbal rejoinders so far. But could it decide to renege on its trade deal commitments to purchase U.S. agricultural products? 
Beijing has been courting American companies such as Tesla  and Starbucks , but it s also looking more inwards for growth. While there were some signs the two countries  trade negotiators were making progress, should Trump s threats continue, trade war might take over from coronavirus as the main worry for markets.

2/SPEED BUMP FOR STOCKS
Having defied reams of poor economic data, U.S. stock markets must contend over the coming week with more evidence of how the pandemic is devastating the economy. 
With swathes of the economy locked down, economists polled by Reuters expect retail sales tumbled 10% in April, surpassing the record 8.4% drop in March. And with factories shuttered, industrial production is forecast to have dropped 11.6% after slipping 5.4% in March. We also get a peek at numbers related to consumer sentiment and inflation.
Will these numbers finally derail the rally in the S&P 500, which has lifted it more than 30% off March lows? Perhaps not; after all, data showing the loss of more than 30 million jobs during the past six weeks has not managed to do that.

3/REHEATED TURKEY
The plummeting lira and Turkish accusations that foreign banks mounted a ""manipulative attack"" on the currency revived memories of the country s 2018 crisis. The lira has slumped to record lows, the coronavirus is bringing deep recession and recent months have seen the central bank burn through a quarter of available forex reserves.
Will its troubles ensnare other emerging markets, many of which are only just resurfacing from under the rubble left by the COVID-19 rout? A degree of such contagion was seen in 2018 when lira weakness dragged on currencies in South Africa, Mexico and Russia.
This time Brazil s real may be the weak link. It has tumbled to a record low through 5.80 per dollar after a large interest rate cut from the central bank. 
South Africa s rand and Mexico s peso are also worth watching. Both have performed poorly this year, having lost 26% and 22% respectively.

4/EURO BASHING
Having racked up the biggest weekly loss in more than a month, the euro looks headed for more weakness. 
A German constitutional court told the European Central Bank to justify its bond-buying programme or risk losing the Bundesbank s participation in the scheme. That handed what is considered the only game in town for rescuing the euro zone - the ECB - a setback that jeopardises future bond buying. 
Several banks swiftly downgraded their forecasts on the single currency after the May 5 ruling.
It s unlikely economic data can offer respite -- an advance reading of the euro zone s first-quarter gross domestic product on Friday is expected to show a contraction of almost 4% quarter-on-quarter, according to a Reuters poll. Perhaps European politicians might draw solace from Britain s plight -- the Bank of England reckons the UK economy may be headed for the biggest slump in more than 300 years.

5/HALF LIFE
For the third time in its short life, bitcoin is about to undergo a ""halving"" -- when the number of new coins awarded to miners of the digital currency is slashed by half. Given previous halvings propelled huge bitcoin rallies, many are wondering what the effect might be this time as the COVID-19 crisis rages.
The first halving occurred in November 2012, from 50 bitcoins to 25 and bitcoin rallied 10,000% between late-2012 and 2014. It was then cut in July 2016 to 12.5 bitcoins and prices rose roughly 2,500% from mid-2016 to record highs in December 2017 of just below $20,000. 
Year-to-date, bitcoin has risen nearly 40%. It stands around $10,000 ahead of the upcoming halving that will take the reward to 6.25. Some doubt the scintillating rallies of the past two halvings can be repeated. Others reckon however that bitcoin, representing a hedge of sorts against the chaos, is well positioned to outperform. They note that during this pandemic its returns have beaten gold, stocks and U.S. Treasuries.

(Reuters) - Tesla  Inc ""must not reopen"" its vehicle factory in the San Francisco Bay area as local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect, the local county health department said on Friday.
The comments came after Tesla s chief executive, Elon Musk, told employees Thursday evening that limited production would restart at the factory in Fremont, Tesla s only U.S. vehicle factory, on Friday afternoon. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday afternoon said that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen. But Alameda County, where the factory is located, is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May.
A spokeswoman for the Alameda County Public Health Department in a statement referred to the county s coronavirus lockdown order that only permits essential businesses to reopen.
""Tesla has been informed that they do not meet those criteria and must not reopen,"" the spokeswoman said.
Earlier on Friday, Erica Pan, a health officer for the county, said the department has had many discussions with the company and recommended that Tesla wait at least another week to monitor infection rates and discuss safe ways to resume production.
Pan, speaking during a virtual townhall with the mayor of the city of Alameda, called Tesla a ""very hot topic.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vehicle manufacturing operations are not allowed to operate regularly, according to the Alameda County order.
Musk has been bluntly criticizing the lockdown and stay-at-home orders, calling them a ""serious risk"" to U.S. business and tagging them ""unconstitutional,"" saying they would not hold up before the U.S. Supreme Court if challenged.
Tesla, in an internal mail seen by Reuters, had said that starting Friday, limited operation would resume at the Fremont factory with 30% of normal headcount per shift.
""Our Gigafactories in Nevada and New York have also begun limited operations as approved by their respective states,"" the mail said.
However, Musk said employees who feel uncomfortable coming back to work were not obligated to do so. 
Tesla had sparred with officials in California in March Tesla over whether it had to halt production at the Fremont factory under lockdown orders that allowed only essential businesses to continue to operate. It ended the stand-off in mid-March and said it would suspend production.
The lockdown order was imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, which has infected over 3.8 million people globally.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic triggered the steepest monthly loss of U.S. jobs since the Great Depression, data showed on Friday, as a second White House aide was diagnosed with the respiratory infection, raising doubt that the highest levels of government are well protected.
A day after the White House confirmed that the personal valet of President Donald Trump had tested positive, Trump told reporters the virus had also infected Katie Miller, press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence. She is married to senior Trump aide and immigration policy hard-liner Stephen Miller and travels frequently with Pence.
""We ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,"" White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters.
Concern over infection control in the White House heightened as the Labor Department reported U.S. unemployment rose 14.7% last month, up from 3.5% in February and demonstrating the speed with which the economy collapsed after stay-at-home orders meant to curb the outbreak were imposed across most of the country.
Even worse economic news may be yet to come. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the unemployment rate was likely to climb to around 20% this month. The jobless rate for April already shattered the post-World War Two record of 10.8% set in November 1982.
The economic devastation has heightened the urgency behind efforts by governors to get their states  economies moving again, even though infection rates and deaths are still rising in some parts of the country. 
More than 77,000 Americans have perished from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, out of more than 1.28 million confirmed cases, according to a Reuters tally.
Elderly individuals and people with underlying chronic health conditions have been the most vulnerable.
But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday reported the death of a 5-year old boy from a rare inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to the coronavirus, highlighting a potential new pandemic risk for children.
The condition, first reported in Britain, Italy and Spain, can attack multiple organs, impair heart function and weaken heart arteries.
Just as the pathogen itself has hit black and Hispanic Americans especially hard - they are overrepresented in the U.S. death toll relative to their population size - minorities also have suffered greater job losses during the crisis.
The April unemployment rate was 14.2% for white Americans, but the rate reached 16.7% among African Americans and 18.9% among Hispanic Americans, the data showed. There also was a gender disparity, with the jobless rate at 13% for men and 15.5% for women.
Overall, the Labor Department reported a loss of 20.5 million jobs in April, a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. On Thursday, the government said that 33.5 million workers had filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits during the past seven weeks. 
Adding to the pain, the sheer crush of Americans seeking to file jobless claims all at once has caused bureaucratic hurdles delaying access to benefits for millions of idled workers.
Trump, seeking re-election in November, initially played down the threat posed by the coronavirus. He has given inconsistent messages about the expected length of the economic shutdown and the conditions under which states should reopen businesses.
""Those jobs will all be back, and they ll be back very soon,"" Trump told Fox News on Friday.
 JUST SO TENSE 
Rita Trivedi, 63, of Hudson , Florida, was furloughed as an analyst at Nielsen Media Research on April 23 and has struggled to secure benefits from the state s troubled unemployment system. She fears she will lack the money to cover her husband s medical bills and other expenses.
""I m more than anxious, I m more than worried - it s  can t sleep  kind of anxious,"" Trivedi said. ""I m just so tense thinking about these things and how to manage.""
California, where the first statewide stay-at-home orders were issued on March 19, moved forward with a partial reopening plan on Friday, allowing manufacturing facilities that meet certain infection-control criteria to resume operations and permitting some retail workplaces, such as bookstores, jewelry stores, clothing stores, sporting goods stores and florists, to offer curbside pick-up and delivery services.
In Los Angeles, few of those stores were open in the downtown area. In-store shopping is not permitted.
Tesla  Inc was aiming to restart production in its U.S. car plant in Fremont, California, on Friday, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk wrote in an email to staff. 
But a health official in Alameda County, where the assembly plant is located, said local lockdown measures remained in effect there and supersede Governor Gavin Newsom s relaxation of statewide restrictions.
""We ve been working with them, but we have not given the green light,"" county health officer Erica Pan said of Tesla.
At least 40 of the 50 U.S. states - including states where cases and deaths are on the upswing - are taking steps to lift restrictions that had affected all but essential businesses. For example, Arizona, Mississippi and South Dakota on Friday all reported record numbers of cases. 

Public health experts said reopening prematurely risks fueling fresh outbreaks. They also have raised concerns that a state-by-state hodgepodge of differing policies confuses the public and undermines social distancing efforts."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  sued local authorities in California on Saturday as the electric carmaker pushed to re-open its factory there and Chief Executive Elon Musk threatened to move Tesla s headquarters and future programs from the state to Texas or Nevada.
Musk has been pushing to re-open Tesla s Fremont, California, factory after Alameda County s health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.
In a blog post on Saturday, Tesla said the county s position left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure Tesla and its employees can go back to work.
The company said it had worked out a thorough return-to-work plan that includes online video training for personnel, work zone partition areas, temperature screening, requirements to wear protective equipment and rigorous cleaning and disinfecting protocols.
The company said it had informed health authorities in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is located, about its restart plans, but claimed the acting official did not return calls or emails.
Alameda County s Public Health Department, which earlier on Saturday said it had been ""communicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team,"" did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla filed a lawsuit against the county in San Francisco federal court on Saturday, calling the continued restrictions a ""power-grab"" by the county since California s governor had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen. 
The company said Alameda was going against the federal and California constitutions, as well as defying the governor s order, the lawsuit said. 
Alameda County is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May, with only essential businesses allowed to reopen. The county said it does not consider Tesla an essential business. County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. 
The outspoken Musk also took to Twitter on Saturday to complain and threatened to leave the state. 
""If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future,"" he tweeted, referring to the San Francisco Bay area facility that is Tesla s only U.S. vehicle factory.
Alameda County said on Saturday that it has been working with Tesla to develop a safety plan that ""allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees"" that work at the factory and that it looks forward to coming to an agreement on a safety plan very soon. 
Fremont Mayor Lily Mei expressed concern about the potential economic implications of continuing the shelter-in-place order without provisions for manufacturers such as Tesla to resume. Mei on Saturday urged the county to work with businesses on ""acceptable guidelines for re-opening.""
Musk had told employees on Thursday that limited production would restart at Fremont on Friday afternoon.
Tesla last year built nearly half a million vehicles at the Fremont plant and moving the entire production facility would be a massive undertaking. 
Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, on Saturday estimated it could take the company 12 to 18 months to relocate production.
The threat to relocate the facility comes as Tesla aims to ramp up production at Fremont of its Model Y sport utility vehicle, which it expects to generate record demand and profit margins.
Musk, who sparred with California officials in March over whether Tesla had to halt production at Fremont, had criticized the lockdown and stay-at-home orders, calling them a ""serious risk"" to U.S. business and ""unconstitutional.""

Tesla shares have risen 127% since March 18, their recent closing low, including a 16.8% gain in the last trading week to close at $819.42 on Friday. "

China s exports rebound has been quickly overshadowed by dire predictions of Trade War II between the world s two biggest economies.
Markets are hoping Donald Trump s threats to penalise China for COVID-19 are pandering to Americans  fear of China during an election year. After all, neither side can afford to further knock business confidence at a time when the world faces the worst economic contraction on record.
In response to U.S. talk of slapping on more tarriffs, stopping U.S. pension money from investing in China and even stripping it of sovereign immunity, China has only offered verbal rejoinders so far. But could it decide to renege on its trade deal commitments to purchase U.S. agricultural products?
Beijing has been courting American companies such as Tesla  and Starbucks , but it s also looking more inwards for growth. While there were some signs the two countries  trade negotiators were making progress, should Trump s threats continue, trade war might take over from coronavirus as the main worry for markets.

2/SPEED BUMP FOR STOCKS
Having defied reams of poor economic data, U.S. stock markets must contend over the coming week with more evidence of how the pandemic is devastating the economy.
With swathes of the economy locked down, economists polled by Reuters expect retail sales tumbled 10% in April, surpassing the record 8.4% drop in March. And with factories shuttered, industrial production is forecast to have dropped 11.6% after slipping 5.4% in March. We also get a peek at numbers related to consumer sentiment and inflation.
Will these numbers finally derail the rally in the S&P 500, which has lifted it more than 30% off March lows? Perhaps not; after all, data showing the loss of more than 30 million jobs during the past six weeks has not managed to do that.

3/REHEATED TURKEY
The plummeting lira and Turkish accusations that foreign banks mounted a ""manipulative attack"" on the currency revived memories of the country s 2018 crisis. The lira has slumped to record lows, the coronavirus is bringing deep recession and recent months have seen the central bank burn through a quarter of available forex reserves.
Will its troubles ensnare other emerging markets, many of which are only just resurfacing from under the rubble left by the COVID-19 rout? A degree of such contagion was seen in 2018 when lira weakness dragged on currencies in South Africa, Mexico and Russia.
This time Brazil s real may be the weak link. It has tumbled to a record low through 5.80 per dollar after a large interest rate cut from the central bank.
South Africa s rand and Mexico s peso are also worth watching. Both have performed poorly this year, having lost 26% and 22% respectively.

4/EURO BASHING
Having racked up the biggest weekly loss in more than a month, the euro looks headed for more weakness.
A German constitutional court told the European Central Bank to justify its bond-buying programme or risk losing the Bundesbank s participation in the scheme. That handed what is considered the only game in town for rescuing the euro zone - the ECB - a setback that jeopardises future bond buying.
Several banks swiftly downgraded their forecasts on the single currency after the May 5 ruling.
It s unlikely economic data can offer respite -- an advance reading of the euro zone s first-quarter gross domestic product on Friday is expected to show a contraction of almost 4% quarter-on-quarter, according to a Reuters poll. Perhaps European politicians might draw solace from Britain s plight -- the Bank of England reckons the UK economy may be headed for the biggest slump in more than 300 years.

5/HALF LIFE
For the third time in its short life, bitcoin is about to undergo a ""halving"" -- when the number of new coins awarded to miners of the digital currency is slashed by half. Given previous halvings propelled huge bitcoin rallies, many are wondering what the effect might be this time as the COVID-19 crisis rages.
The first halving occurred in November 2012, from 50 bitcoins to 25 and bitcoin rallied 10,000% between late-2012 and 2014. It was then cut in July 2016 to 12.5 bitcoins and prices rose roughly 2,500% from mid-2016 to record highs in December 2017 of just below $20,000.
Year-to-date, bitcoin has risen nearly 40%. It stands around $10,000 ahead of the upcoming halving that will take the reward to 6.25. Some doubt the scintillating rallies of the past two halvings can be repeated. Others reckon however that bitcoin, representing a hedge of sorts against the chaos, is well positioned to outperform. They note that during this pandemic its returns have beaten gold, stocks and U.S. Treasuries.

Investing.com -- The White House is suffering a mini-outbreak of Covid-19, which is putting a dampener on the U.S. stock market opening. Central banks from China to Europe talk up the prospect of more stimulus measures, while two Fed speeches will be scanned for hints of support to the idea that interest rates could turn negative next year. Earnings season is winding down, but there are upates from Marriott and Coty , among others. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, May 11th.
1. Covid-19 in the White House
U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence missed a meeting with President Donald Trump at the weekend but is not in quarantine and will return to the White House on Monday, Bloomberg quoted a spokesman for Pence as saying.
Pence has tested negatively for the virus every day since his press secretary Katie Miller tested positive for the virus last week.
Two other members of the White House task force on Covid-19, headed by Pence, are self-isolating, while Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is in a “modified” quarantine, according to reports.
The news comes after a valet for President Trump also tested positive for the virus last week.  It comes against a mixed global backdrop: the U.K. said its lockdown measures will be relaxed slightly from Wednesday, while Disney s Shanghai theme park opened its gates again, but infection curves in countries from India to Russia and Brazil continued to rise steeply.
2. China promises more stimulus; car sales rebound
The Chinese central bank promised “more powerful” policies to counter the economic effect of the pandemic, indicating that the pressures on the world’s second-largest economy aren’t easing significantly, despite the anecdotal evidence that points to a gradual return to normal. However, the PBoC didn’t provide much detail of what those policies would be in a quarterly report published on Sunday.
There were strong signs of the authorities pushing liquidity out into the economy via the banking system in April. New loans rose by 1,700 billion yuan, compared to estimates of 1,300 billion, while M2 money supply and total social financing, the broadest measure of credit, also rose faster than expected.
China also posted its first year-on-year increase in auto sales in two years in April, with overall sales rising 5.5%.
3. U.S. stocks set to open lower; Tesla s lawsuit, sales in focus
U.S. stocks are set to open mostly lower on Monday amid unease at the mini-outbreak of the coronavirus in the West Wing, an uncomfortable reminder of the persistent risk of infection as the U.S.  economy reopens.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was down 144 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 contract was down 0.3%.
One stock likely to be in focus on Monday is Tesla , which is suing Alameda County in California for permission to reopen its only U.S. production plant in Fremont. Founder and CEO Elon Musk threatened over the weekend to relocate the plant to Texas, a move that would likely involve a costly if temporary disruption to production. Separately, Tesla also saw its Model 3 sales fall 64% in China in April.
4. Earnings season rolls on.
Earnings season is winding down but there are still a number of notable reports due in the course of the day.
Payments company Worldpay  and cell carrier Sprint Corp  all report before the opening, along with hotel group Marriott, generic drug specialist Mylan, sports gear maker Under Armour and Coty.
IFF reports after the closing bell, along with mall owner Simon Property  and Tencent Music Entertainment.   
5. Fed speakers in focus amid negative rate speculation
With speculation on U.S. interest rates turning negative next year, there’ll perhaps be more attention than usual to two appearances from senior Federal Reserve policy-makers in the course of the day.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic is due to speak at 12 PM ET, while his Chicago counterpart Charles Evans will speak half an hour later. Their interventions come ahead of an eagerly-anticipated appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday.
In addition to the PBoC, two members of the European Central Bank’s governing council – German board member Isabel Schnabel and Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau – both talked up the possibility of further monetary stimulus over the weekend."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower Monday, consolidating after recent gains as investors consider the risk of a resurgence in the coronavirus as lockdowns are lifted.
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 1.6%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures down 22 points, or 0.3%. The Dow futures contract fell 144 points, or 0.6%.
Wall Street posted its first winning week in three last week, overlooking Friday’s 20.5 million job losses which sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7 per cent, by far the worst number seen since the Great Depression. 
Leading the gains have been the country’s tech giants. The Nasdaq 100 index is now just over 5% off its all time high, despite the grim economic news.
Boosting the general optimism of late has been the idea that the American economy is reopening - California, Michigan, and Ohio, three of the important states for U.S. manufacturing, have taken steps to allow factories and some businesses to resume work.
However, the news out of South Korea, earlier Friday, of a new spike in cases has prompted concerns as the East Asian nation has been praised globally for its efforts in curbing the virus.
The United States has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths in the pandemic, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, although aggregate numbers for Europe are still higher.
In the corporate sector, AMC Entertainment  stock was up over 9% premarket following a report that linked Amazon  to the world’s largest cinema chain, which has faced difficulties given the economic shutdown.
Tesla  stock fell 3.4% premarket after the electric carmaker’s boss Elon Musk said it had filed a lawsuit against Alameda County in California, after the county’s health department had refused to let the Tesla factory reopen Friday. Musk added he may move the electric carmaker s headquarters out of California.
Walt  Disney   will also be in focus after its Shanghai Disneyland park reopened at 30% of capacity Monday, a first small step to restoring one of the group s biggest profit machines. 
Oil futures slipped back Monday, consolidating after recent gains had pushed the sector from the all-time lows seen recently. Last week the oil market also posted its first winning week in three.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 1.7% lower at $24.32 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.5% to $30.20.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,701.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0817, down 0.2%."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week in negative mood, as concerns about the persistent risk of renewed outbreaks of the coronavirus prompted fears that the rally in recent weeks may have gone too far, too fast.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 207 points, or 0.9% at 24,124 points. The S&P 500was down 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%. 
The mood was overshadowed by reports suggesting multiple White House staff had either contracted or been exposed to the Coronavirus, including vice-president Mike Pence. Negative earnings reports from hotel operator Marriott and concern about Tesla s falling sales in China also weighed. Tesla   stock opened 3.4% lower.
The catastrophic labor market report for April, which showed that over 20 million American jobs were shed last month, may have been shrugged off initially, but a weekend of reflection appears to have made investors more skeptical of the narrative that an early reopening of the economy will bring a swift rebound.
Goldman Sachs  analysts are now predicting the S&P 500 could fall by some 18% over the next three months.
""A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a weekly note to clients. 
The AAII investor sentiment survey at the end of last week had showed only 23.7% of investors were still bullish about stocks at their current levels, a decline of nearly seven percentage points from the previous week. That compared to nearly 53% of respondents who were bearish. 
Against that backdrop, bank stocks weakened as investors gave more credence to speculation that U.S. interest rates could dip below zero next year.  Citigroup   stock fell 4.8% and JPMorgan  stock fell 3.0%.
Airline stocks also fell sharply against a backdrop of United Airlines Holdings   canceling a proposed sale of new debt at the end of last week (the stock was down 6.8%), while Boeing   stock fell 3.5% after Qantas pushed back the timeline for taking delivery of the new aircraft it had ordered.
Marriott International  stock fell 5.8% after the hotel operator warned that room occupancy had not meaningfully rebounded in Greater China since lockdowns were lifted there. First-quarter earnings and revenue fell short of expectations that had already been sharply revised down."

(Reuters) - Tesla  Inc sued local authorities in California on Saturday as the electric carmaker pushed to re-open its factory there and Chief Executive Elon Musk threatened to move Tesla s headquarters and future programs from the state to Texas or Nevada.
Musk has been pushing to re-open Tesla s Fremont, California, factory after Alameda County s health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.
In a blog post on Saturday, Tesla said the county s position left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure Tesla and its employees can go back to work.
The company said it had worked out a thorough return-to-work plan that includes online video training for personnel, work zone partition areas, temperature screening, requirements to wear protective equipment and rigorous cleaning and disinfecting protocols.
The company said it had informed health authorities in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is located, about its restart plans, but claimed the acting official did not return calls or emails.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday said production was resuming at the automaker s sole U.S. vehicle factory, in California, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested it should be him.
The move comes as states and cities around the United States experiment with ways to safely reopen their economies after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work.
Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from U.S. President Donald Trump.
In an email on Monday, Tesla referred to an order on Thursday by California s governor allowing manufacturers to resume operations and said that as of Sunday, previously furloughed employees were back to their regular employment status.
""We re happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,"" according to the email seen by Reuters and titled ""Furlough Has Ended And We Are Back To Work in Production!""
Musk in a tweet said production was resuming on Monday, adding that he would join workers on the assembly line. ""If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,"" he wrote.
Health officials in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is based, late on Monday said they were aware that Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.
In a statement, officials said they expected a proposal from Tesla later on Monday and ""hope Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures."" The statement did not specify consequences and said officials would not comment further.
The county s lockdown order says violations are punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. 
A spokeswoman for the Fremont Police Department on Monday said her office was enforcing the lockdown order at the direction of the health department and had been advised that the county is working with Tesla directly.
Separately on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said California should do whatever is necessary to help the electric carmaker reopen its only U.S. vehicle factory if it wants to keep the company in its state.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he spoke to Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week. 
“I have not only known that company but I have known its founder for many, many years,” Newsom said in his daily coronavirus press briefing. “I have great reverence for their technology, for their innovative spirit, for their leadership.”
Tesla, which also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin, on Saturday sued the county, alleging it had violated California s constitution by defying Newsom s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.
Musk has discussed opening a second U.S. factory outside California in the past. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.
Since his threat to leave California on Saturday, officials from Texas, Georgia, Utah, Oklahoma and Nevada have reached out to Musk on Twitter, encouraging him to relocate to their state.
A Texas official said his county was available immediately to accommodate Tesla and invited the billionaire CEO for a visit.
""We have a motivated, pro-business governor,"" Richard Cortez, county judge of Texas  Hidalgo County, said on Monday. ""What we no longer have is a shelter at home mandate.""
Musk in response tweeted: ""Note is much appreciated.""

Investing.com -- The Senate will hold a hearing on the health implications of reopening the economy, with Anthony Fauci heading the cast of testimony-givers. Elon Musk is daring the authorities in Alameda County to arrest him as he reopens Tesla  s plant in the Bay Area, while global markets remain twitchy amid signs of renewed outbreaks of Covid-19. The dollar strengthened as Fed officials batted away the prospect of negative rates. The price of oil resumed its recovery on the back of nearly 1.2 million barrels a day in additional production cuts by Gulf producers, mostly Saudi Arabia. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, May 12th. 
1. Senate to hold hearing on reopening
The Senate will hear testimony from senior health officials – including Anthony Fauci, the country’s top expert on infectious diseases - on the implications of reopening the U.S. economy.
The hearing will take place via teleconference because both witnesses and senators are, in part, self-isolating after coming into contact with infected people.
The number of U.S. deaths fell for a fourth straight day on Monday to only 837, while the number of confirmed new cases also fell for a third straight day.
On Monday, President Donald Trump had said at a news conference that “we have prevailed” with regard to ramping up testing.  
2. Global markets remain twitchy as mini-outbreaks flare
Global markets are still in cautious mode, afraid of the possibility of a second wave of infections after the discover of five new cases in Wuhan, China, and a new cluster of cases in South Korea linked to the nightclub district of the capital, Seoul.
In addition, Germany’s Robert-Koch-Institute said on Sunday that the reproduction rate of the virus had rebounded above 1 in the wake of lockdown restrictions being eased earlier in the month. The so-called r0 rate had fallen as low as 0.65 only last week but rebounded on an uptick of cases in slaughterhouses and care homes.
Elsewhere, Russian President Vladimir Putin has abandoned his nationwide lockdown even though the rate of new infections stayed above 10,000 for a 10th straight day. The lockdown has caused Putin’s approval ratings to plummet to their worst in over a decade, after exposing weaknesses in the country’s health system and social safety net.
3. Stocks set to open slightly higher; CPI, Fed speakers eyed
U.S. stocks are set to open modestly higher, amid a growing chorus from analysts and investors that the April relief rally had gotten ahead of itself.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was down 57 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract and the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract were up in parallel. The three indices had been mixed on Monday.
The dollar, meanwhile, is strengthening after three top Federal Reserve officials each downplayed the likelihood of the Fed cutting the target fed funds range to below zero. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said negative rates were “one of the weaker tools in the toolkit”, while Charles Evans said he saw no use for them. CPI data for April at 8:30 will likely not change their view.
There will be a further barrage of Fed speeches starting with the St. Louis and Minnesota Fed Presidents James Bullard and Neel Kashkari at 9 AM ET, followed by Philadelphia’s Patrick Harker and top banking supervisor Randall Quarles at 10 AM. 
Separately, the Fed will also start its flagged purchases of bond ETFs today.
4. Musk reopens Tesla plant
Elon Musk reopened Tesla’s plant in Fremont, daring Bay Area officials to arrest him.
The Tesla founder has expressed his frustration at the closure of the Fremont facility in increasingly forceful fashion in recent days, as Alameda County keeps the factory shut despite a broader relaxation of restrictions on manufacturing at the state level. Governor Gavin Newsom said he would defer to county officials.  
The news comes after Tesla  stock hit its highest in over two months last week, supported by hopes of a revival in sales as the U.S. and European economies reopen.
5. Oil gains momentum after Saudi leads more output cuts
Oil prices resumed their recovery on the back of additional output cuts announced on Monday by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
The additional cuts will remove another 1.18 million barrels of oil a day from the global market from June 1, hastening the process of rebalancing a market still suffering from an unprecedented drop in demand. Saudi Arabia is cutting 1 million b/d, the UAE 100,000 b/d and Kuwait 80,000 b/d.
Elsewhere, BP  CEO Bernard Looney said the pandemic could bring forward the date when global oil demand peaks. Looney said he expected the impact on fuel demand to be long-lasting and, in some regards, permanent."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher Tuesday, continuing the recent tech-led gains, amid optimism as the country heads back to work.
At 06:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.2%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 18 points, or 0.2%. The Dow futures contract rose 53 points, also a gain of 0.2%.
It’s the Nasdaq index, the home of the country’s tech giants, which has been dominant. It is currently on a winning streak of six days, the longest since December, and is actually up 2.5% since the start of the year, benefiting from a preference for Internet-focused companies that have escaped the worst of restrictions on Main Street business.
Investors are likely to receive a stark warning about the dangers of reopening businesses too early when Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies before a Senate committee later Tuesday.
Fauci told the  New York Times   that the U.S. risks ""needless suffering and death"" if the economy reopens too soon.
In the corporate sector, Tesla  is likely to remain in the spotlight after CEO Elon Musk said the electric carmaker would restart production in California in defiance of a county lockdown order.
The airline sector will also be in focus after Boeing  Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told NBC that he doesn’t expect traffic levels to rebound significantly by September, and a major U.S. carrier is likely to go out of business this year.
The market will get the latest numbers on retail inflation, with the April consumer price index due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists expect that the CPI fell 0.8% in April to an annual rate of 0.4%.
Oil futures pushed higher Tuesday, helped by Saudi Arabia’s decision Monday to voluntarily increase the extent of its production cuts by an additional million barrels a day. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates also followed the Saudi lead.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell. A report from private consultancy Seevol on Monday suggested that stocks at the U.S. national hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, had fallen by 2.17 million barrels last week.
At 6:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.3% higher at $25.43 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.9% to $30.50.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,708.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0833, up 0.3%."

HONG KONG/BEIJING(Reuters) - Challenged by the arrival of Tesla  in China last year, domestic electric vehicle (EV) start-ups were struggling even before the economic shock wrought by the coronavirus, but now for some it has become a battle for survival.
New energy vehicle (NEVs) sales fell for a tenth straight month in April, plummeting 43% from a year earlier in a market that has now got 50-or-so established start-ups competing with domestic giants like Geely, state-owned FAW Group, and foreign marques like Tesla Inc and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
""The difficulties that EV start-ups have encountered, such as the auto sales decline, harsh fundraising environment and subsidies reduction, all started last year,"" said Brian Gu, president of Alibaba-backed Xpeng Motors.
""The outbreak will aggravate these issues that already had existed,"" said Gu, whose firm delivered 16,000 vehicles in 2019.
Despite subsidies to EV makers and tax breaks for buyers, industry watchers fear electric vehicles could become an even harder sell after the plunge in global oil prices, which has made the technology a less attractive bet for consumers and investors alike.
Even Buffett-backed long-established EV maker BYD reported 85% profit drop in the first quarter due to the slide in sales caused by coronavirus.
Still, Cui Dongshu, secretary general at China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), noted some of the leading EV startups managed ""okay"" sales in the first quarter, listing Nio  Inc, Xpeng Motors and Li Auto as examples. 
But the downswing does not bode well for China s chances of hitting a target for NEVs - a category that includes plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells - to account for 25% of all automobile sales by 2025 compared with the current 5%.
CUTTING COSTS, SEARCHING FOR FUNDING
An investor in WM Motor, which sold nearly 17,000 vehicles last year, expected EV makers still producing on a smaller scale to fall by the wayside during this contraction in the market.
""Those who had not launched mass production of their car models by 2019 would probably die. The outbreak is going to accelerate their death,"" the investor, who requested anonymity, said.
WM Motor, backed by Baidu Inc , said it had cancelled performance bonuses due to failure to meet 2019 targets and delayed payments of annual bonuses and employee subsidies due to the economic challenges arising from the coronavirus epidemic.
Some smaller EV makers have resorted to salary cuts and lay-offs, according to employees. 
Volatile financial markets have made it harder for firms to drum up funding from share issues. During the first quarter, China s EV makers only secured $200 million of new funding, according to PitchBook data.
Gu declined to comment on plans for an IPO by Xpeng, which launched P7 sedan models on April 27 and plans to export G3 sport-utility vehicles to Norway. 
""Only the top-tier EV makers will be able to attract attention from investors in this environment,"" said Gu, adding that Xpeng kept an open mind for diversified sources of capital.
Li Auto, also known as CHJ Automotive, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering, aiming to raise at least $500 million, sources told Reuters in January. And its founder has since said the firm has sufficient cash reserves to weather the impact from virus.
Other firms have turned to the state for funding. 
Nio, a trailblazer among these start-ups, set up a new entity, Nio China, which secured a 7 billion yuan ($986.78 million) investment from state-controlled investors.
Luchi Motor, one of China s earliest EV startups, sold a controlling stake to the investment company of Henan province in March, after it failed to deliver cars as scheduled.

Investing.com - President Donald Trump on Tuesday backed Tesla  CEO Elon Musk’s plan to open his California auto plant today in defiance of Alameda County rules.
Trump also called again for negative interest rates for U.S. debt.
“California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!” Trump tweeted.
 
Musk tweeted his intentions to open late Monday and said he would be “on the line with everyone else.”
""If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,"" he said.
Shares of Tesla rose 2.3% in morning trading.
Shortly afterwards, Trump tweeted support for negative rates, something the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to entertain, although fed fund futures do predict rates will turn negative next year.
“As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the ‘GIFT’. Big numbers!” Trump tweeted.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned negative on Tuesday as President Donald Trump renewed his pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, hitting financial stocks in particular.  
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 97 points, or 0.4%, at 24,319 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both slightly down.
""As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the “GIFT”. Big numbers!"" Trump tweeted. 
JPMorgan  stock fell 1.0% while Bank of America  stock fell 0.9% and  Citigroup   stock fell 0.8%, reversing early gains, amid fear that even lower official interest rates will squeeze their profit margins as has been the case in other countries where the strategy has been tried, such as the euro zone and Japan.
Bank stocks had opened marginally higher, reassured by comments from three Federal Reserve officials in the last 24 hours downplaying the benefits of negative rates. Speculation that the Fed may cut the fed funds target range to below zero has increased in recent days as markets have moved to price in a slower, flatter recovery that charts more like a Nike-style swoosh than a V. There were fresh signs of the near-term deflationary impact on the economy from the pandemic earlier, as consumer prices fell by 0.8% in April, their biggest drop in over a decade.
The mood was in any case cautious, amid lingering concerns that the rushed reopening of the U.S. economy may lead to a second wave of infections and lockdowns later in the year.
“Some U.S. states that are relaxing restrictions are not always those that should, being earlier on the recovery curve, either having peaked later or still increasing,” analysts at Sanford C Bernstein wrote in a note to clients. “We believe multiple U.S. states will struggle with further relaxing requirements as disease trends will start heading the wrong way. Modelling the pandemic forward suggests even moderately elevated Rt =1.05 will lead to unacceptable disease rates come the fall.”
The U.S. Senate is due to hear testimony from top scientists later Tuesday on the risks of reopening the economy. One of the scientists testifying will be Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases. The  New York Times   cited an email from Fauci on Tuesday saying that a premature opening ""risks needless suffering and death.""
Against that backdrop, Tesla  stock rose 2.1% after CEO Elon Musk reopened the company s production facility in Fremont before getting the approval of local authorities, who still have an extensive lockdown order in place.
Elsewhere, BlackRock  stock fell 5.3% while PNC Financial   fell 2.0% after the latter said it intends to offload its 22% stake in the asset manager. "

FREMONT, California (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged that Tesla Inc  be allowed to reopen its electric vehicle assembly plant in California, joining CEO Elon Musk s bid to defy county officials who have ordered it to remain closed.
""California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. 
On Monday, Musk said production was resuming at the automaker’s sole U.S. vehicle factory, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested, it should be he.
Musk tweeted ""Thank you!"" in response to Trump on Tuesday.
Tesla shares were up 1.1% at $820.44 in late trading.
At Tesla s factory in Fremont, California, employee parking lots that were deserted on Friday were packed with cars on Tuesday. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.
About a dozen workers, some masked, some not, were seen standing by a red food truck on the factory grounds.
At the factory s outbound logistics parking lot, where only a dozen Tesla cars stood on Friday, hundreds of Tesla vehicles were seen on Tuesday.
The company, which on Saturday sued Alameda County, where the plant is located, over its decision that the plant should stay closed, did not comment on Trump s tweet.
Late on Monday, county health officials said they were aware Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.
A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.
Scott Haggerty, the Alameda County supervisor for the district where Tesla s factory is located, told the  New York Times   on Saturday that the county had been working to permit Tesla to resume operations on May 18 - the same day other U.S. automakers have been permitted to resume production in other states.
Haggerty on Tuesday accused Musk on Twitter of misrepresenting what he had told the newspaper.
Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.
The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors , Ford  and  Fiat  Chrysler  .
Trump is eager for the U.S. economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.
He has sparred with California for years over a series of issues, including immigration, vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, funding for high-speed rail and numerous environmental issues. Trump has met with Musk on several occasions during his presidency.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he had spoken with Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week.
States and cities around the United States are experimenting with ways to reopen their economies safely after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work. 
Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.
Tesla also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin. Its lawsuit on Saturday alleged that Alameda County had violated California s constitution by defying Newsom s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.
Newsom s office did not immediately comment on Tuesday. 

In the past, Musk has discussed opening a second U.S. factory outside California. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas."

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Tuesday that he spoke with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc , in recent days about a potential move of the company s electric vehicle assembly plant to the Lone Star state.
Abbott s remarks came just came three days after Musk threatened to move Tesla s headquarters and future operations to either Texas or Nevada, after officials in the California county where Tesla s only U.S. vehicle factory is located said the plant could not reopen because coronavirus lockdown measures remained in place.
Abbott said during an interview with the Wichita Falls CBS affiliate that he thinks Texas is a perfect fit for Tesla . A spokesman for Abbott confirmed to Reuters the governor spoke with Musk over the weekend. 
""I ve had the opportunity to talk to Elon Musk and he s genuinely interested in Texas and genuinely frustrated with California,"" Abbott said. ""We ve just got to wait and see how things play out."" 
Abbott did not provide details of the conversation. John Wittman, the governor s communications director, said there was not yet any discussion of incentives to entice Tesla away from California.
Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Musk last Thursday had told employees that limited production would restart at the Tesla factory in Fremont, after California Governor Gavin Newsom said that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen under an easing of coronavirus containment measures. But officials in Alameda County, where Fremont is located, said its own lockdown measures had not been lifted and the factory could not yet reopen.
Musk on Saturday tweeted: ""If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future."" 
President Donald Trump weighed in on Tuesday, tweeting that California should let Tesla get back to work.
On Monday, Musk said production was resuming at the factory in defiance of the county order and that if anyone had to be arrested, it should be him. On Tuesday, employee parking lots that were deserted on Friday were packed with cars. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.
Musk is no stranger to Texas. His SpaceX spacecraft manufacturer has a launch site in the southern tip of the state near the village of Boca Chica. 
Richard Cortez, the top executive in Hidalgo County just to the west of the SpaceX launch site, urged Musk in a letter to consider the area for Tesla, saying the region s heavy presence of automotive plants straddling the U.S.-Mexico border could quickly meet the electric car maker s needs. 
Cortez, in an interview with Reuters, underscored that manufacturing plants in his county have never been under any orders to close because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

In addition to its vehicle plant in California, Tesla has a battery plant in Sparks, Nevada, and a factory in Buffalo, New York, that produces solar panels and other energy generation and storage products."

Health officers for Alameda County said on Twitter late Tuesday that a reopening can happen if Tesla adopts extra recommendations to battle the coronavirus in its safety plans. Tesla had sent Alameda a new plan for meeting criteria to reopen on Monday.
The health department said it held “productive discussions” with Tesla and reviewed its safety and prevention plans, and will allow additional approved activities for local businesses including Tesla on May 18, provided data shows progress with containing the virus.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had said Monday that Tesla would restart production at the plant in Fremont and flout county officials who had ordered the company to keep the factory closed. Earlier on Tuesday, he thanked President Donald Trump for endorsing his reopening of the factory.
“California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,” Trump wrote in a tweet Tuesday. “It can be done Fast & Safely!”
The county and six other San Francisco Bay area municipalities had decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May to battle the spread of the coronavirus. While California Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities could keep stricter measures in place.
Overnight, Musk sent an email to employees: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.
When asked on Twitter how Monday went at the factory, Musk replied Tuesday: “Great.” Tesla’s shares fell 0.2% in New York trading Tuesday. The stock has almost doubled this year.
Two workers who have returned to work at the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.
Musk’s emailed words of encouragement to staff followed tweets in which he claimed Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas and may even cease manufacturing in California. To follow through on those threats, the CEO would have to uproot many of the roughly 20,000 employees the carmaker has in the San Francisco Bay area. About half of the company’s headcount is at the factory.
He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.
After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk is waging another legal battle. This time, he’s tangling with health officials over measures to contain a virus that he downplayed starting in January.
Musk has claimed Covid-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.
What Bloomberg Opinion Says
Reopening a for-profit plant — and potentially endangering workers — for the sole purpose of making money isn’t a situation where morality should trump the law. And it should go without saying that it would create a truly terrible precedent if corporations could just ignore laws that they consider to be in violation of their corporate interests.

Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen. The nation’s top infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, warned against reopening the economy too soon during a Senate hearing Tuesday, saying that doing so risks new coronavirus outbreaks throughout the U.S.
Trump’s supportive Twitter post followed words of encouragement that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin offered to Musk on Monday.
“He’s one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in California,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “California should prioritize doing whatever they need to do to solve those health issues so that he can open quickly and safely.”
Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director and Elon’s brother, shared a story on Mnuchin’s remarks with his more than 107,000 followers. “Only California and @GavinNewsom⁩ could make me a Trump fan,” he wrote.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla  Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk s fight with local authorities over the reopening of its California plant has gotten the attention of those who scout sites for new factories and corporate offices, as well as economic development officials hungry for more jobs.
The different speeds at which states are reopening their economies amid the coronavirus pandemic are becoming a factor as company executives consider where to locate operations, site selection and state economic development officials said. 
Since the disagreement between Tesla and Alameda County gained national attention, officials from such states as Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Utah and Oklahoma have pitched Musk about considering their state. Analysts estimate it would take Tesla 12 to 18 months to move production.
The Fremont factory employs more than 10,000 people, according to the automaker.
""All you have to do is look at Elon Musk s tweets to see that at least at the highest level of some businesses, people are definitely paying attention to how states have handled this situation,"" said Pat Wilson, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development, in a telephone interview.
New site selection projects have slowed amid the COVID-19 outbreak. But deals are still being closed and work has largely moved to the virtual world thanks to drones, laptops and Zoom meetings - dubbed ""armchair site selection"" by Darin Buelow, principal with Deloitte Consulting and leader of the firm s global location strategy. 
""That county has created an opening for others to come in and recruit,"" said Mark Williams , president of South Carolina site selection firm Strategic Development Group. ""We need to get an idea of, if we have a problem do they have our back?  Our back  could mean helping when a tornado comes through or dealing with some kind of labor issue."" 
Williams  firm has helped Nissan  Motor Co Ltd, BMW and auto suppliers choose plant sites.
Industry officials said one outcome of the crisis could be a push by both domestic and international firms to bring more production closer to the U.S. market to reduce supply chain risks, said Greg Burkart, practice leader for site selection at consulting firm Duff & Phelps. 
In late April, Georgia announced deals for a $727 million battery plant by South Korea s SK Innovation Co Ltd and an Amazon.com  warehouse. 
States are taking advantage of Tesla s troubles in California to promote themselves.
Officials in Tennessee, which is home to auto plants for Nissan, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors Co , cited the state s long track record in the sector.
""Would Tennessee be interested in another automaker coming to our state? Absolutely,"" Bob Rolfe, the state commissioner in charge of economic development, said in a telephone interview.
Richard Cortez, the county judge of Texas  Hidalgo County, on the border of Mexico, on Monday reached out to Musk on Twitter, saying his county was available immediately to accommodate Tesla and invited the billionaire CEO for a visit. 
In February, Musk teased the idea of a plant in Texas when he tweeted ""Giga Texas?"" in reference to the gigafactory terminology the company uses. 
Mike Kazmierski, CEO of the Economic Development Authority in Western Nevada, said he wondered about the ultimate fallout in California. Kazmierski helped land Tesla s battery plant near Reno.
""You don t know how much of what s going on between Elon Musk and the officials in California is posturing and how much of it is real,"" he said.

Beyond tension over reopening, site selection experts said the damage done to state budgets could be a factor as businesses choose where to locate operations."

(Reuters) - Tesla  Inc and officials in California have resolved their acrimonious clash over safety procedures at the automaker’s sole U.S. assembly plant with a deal that allows production to resume as early as Monday, county officials said.
The county said the automaker could take additional steps ahead of next week after Chief Executive Elon Musk had vowed to defy authorities, saying Monday he was resuming production despite the prohibition. On Tuesday, he also won the backing of President Donald Trump.
In a tweet, Alameda County said that following talks with Tesla it agreed that the electric carmaker can take steps ""in preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week."" 
Tesla did not immediately comment Wednesday but around the same time the county issued its statement, Musk tweeted: ""Life should be lived.""
Tesla s sole U.S. electric vehicle assembly plant is in Fremont, California, which is in Alameda County.
The county said it would work with police in Fremont ""to verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing and that agreed upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production.""
On Monday, Musk said production was resuming in Fremont, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested, it should be him.
On Tuesday, Musk won Trump s backing. ""California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. The White House did not immediately comment on the announcement.
Tesla fell 3.3% in afternoon trading to $782.43.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told CNBC that ""conversation is going on between Tesla and the county. But at the state level, we re ready to enforce if we find that anyone is violating the state orders issued by the governor.""
On Tuesday, employee parking lots at Tesla s factory in Fremont, California, were packed with cars. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.
At the Fremont factory s outbound logistics parking lot, where only a dozen Tesla cars were parked last week, hundreds of Tesla vehicles were seen on Tuesday.
The company had sued Alameda County challenging its decision that the plant should stay closed.
A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.
Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.
The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors , Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Those automakers are set to resume at most U.S. auto plants starting Monday.
Trump is eager for the U.S. economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.
Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.
Last month, Musk was on a call with Trump and other chief executives to discuss the reopening of the U.S. economy in which Musk said he wanted to be able to resume production by May 1 or earlier, a person briefed on the call confirmed. Details of the call were reported earlier by the Washington Post.
Musk s fight with local authorities has gotten the attention of those who scout sites for new factories and corporate offices, as well as economic development officials hungry for more jobs.
Since the disagreement between Tesla and Alameda County gained national attention, officials from such states as Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Utah and Oklahoma have pitched Musk about considering their state. Analysts estimate it would take Tesla 12 to 18 months to move production.

The Fremont factory employs more than 10,000 people, according to the automaker."

MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Los Angeles beaches reopened on Wednesday after weeks of coronavirus closure, drawing Californians out for a glimpse of the sun one day after learning that sweeping stay-at-home orders could remain in place all summer. 
The new rules imposed by county health officials allow residents back to the shore as long as they wear masks when not in the water and stay ""active"" by surfing, swimming or running. Sitting on the sand is still prohibited.
""I found it really good. People are paying attention, nobody s really lounging out there because otherwise (Governor Gavin) Newsom is going to have a cow, because the rule is just to keep moving,"" said Caron Carus at Manhattan Beach, southwest of Los Angeles.
The closure of California s beaches by Newsom or local officials has been a point of contention as U.S. states slowly lift unprecedented clampdowns imposed on residents and businesses in March to control the spread of the virus. 
On Wednesday the National Park Service announced limited access to Grand Canyon and Yellowstone national parks, which were both closed due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Los Angeles County Health Director Barbara Ferrer said on Tuesday that stay-at-home rules for some 10 million residents, including the city of Los Angeles, would likely remain in force through the summer, although some restrictions would be eased.
Many state governors, concerned about the economic fallout from prolonged lockdowns, have said they would lift restrictions carefully and gradually, requiring businesses to maintain physical distance from customers and clean surfaces frequently.
GOVERNORS SEEK HELP
So far 16 California counties have been granted permission by the state to loosen guidelines, allowing the return of sit-down dining in restaurants and destination retail, although with social distancing modifications. 
Tesla Inc  reached a deal with local officials to resume production at its electric vehicle assembly plant in the Northern California city of Fremont as early as Monday. CEO Elon Musk had vowed to open the plant in defiance of the restrictions.
But California s state university system, the largest in the United States, on Tuesday cancelled classes on campus for the fall semester and moved instruction online because of the coronavirus.
Newsom, due to release a dramatically revised state budget on Thursday, said the pandemic could make California s yearly fire season even more challenging, citing the danger of housing evacuees together in shelters.
The National Governors Association on Wednesday urged lawmakers in Washington, D.C., to put aside partisan bickering and deliver urgent relief to cities and states facing potential economic ruin.
""This is not a red state and blue state crisis ... It does not attack Democrats or Republicans. It attacks Americans,"" the association s chair, Maryland s Larry Hogan, a Republican, and its vice chair, New York s Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, wrote in a statement, citing the colors associated with their respective parties. 
WASHINGTON LAWMAKERS DEBATE RELIEF
The plea followed the unveiling on Tuesday of a $3 trillion-plus coronavirus relief package by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposal would provide funding for states, businesses and families hit by a pandemic that has infected nearly 1.4 million people in the United States and killed more than 82,000.
Republicans in Congress want to hold off on new coronavirus relief until an assessment of the impact of nearly $3 trillion in assistance that Congress allocated since early March.
Calling it ""dead on arrival,"" President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Democratic proposal had no chance of becoming law. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. response had been ""particularly swift and forceful,"" but called for additional spending to mitigate the effects of lockdowns that have shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work.
New Jersey and Iowa announced tentative steps to resurrect commerce while Washington, D.C., extended its stay-at-home order through June 8.
Wisconsin s Supreme Court rejected Governor Tony Evers  extension of a stay-at-home order, siding with the Republican state legislature. The decision requires him to work with the legislature on how the state should handle the outbreak.
In Michigan, activists were expected to protest in the state capital of Lansing on Thursday against Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer s stay-at-home orders, prompting fears some might again bring weapons inside the capitol building. 
Whitmer recently extended the order, one of the strictest in the nation, until at least May 28. 

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered on April 30, and some protesters with guns — which are allowed in the Michigan statehouse — went to the Senate gallery."

(Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Inc  plans to introduce a new low-cost, long-life battery in its Model 3 sedan in China later this year or early next that it expects will bring the cost of electric vehicles in line with gasoline models, and allow EV batteries to have second and third lives in the electric power grid.
For months, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has been teasing investors, and rivals, with promises to reveal significant advances in battery technology during a ""Battery Day"" in late May. 
New, low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles of use and enable electric Teslas to sell profitably for the same price or less than a gasoline vehicle are just part of Musk s agenda, people familiar with the plans told Reuters. 
With a global fleet of more than 1 million electric vehicles that are capable of connecting to and sharing power with the grid, Tesla s goal is to achieve the status of a power company, competing with such traditional energy providers as Pacific Gas & Electric (A:PCG_pa) and Tokyo Electric Power (T:9501), those sources said.
The new “million mile” battery at the center of Tesla s strategy was jointly developed with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750) and deploys technology developed by Tesla in collaboration with a team of academic battery experts recruited by Musk, three people familiar with the effort said. 
Eventually, improved versions of the battery, with greater energy density and storage capacity and even lower cost, will be introduced in additional Tesla vehicles in other markets, including North America, the sources said.
Tesla’s plan to launch the new battery first in China and its broader strategy to reposition the company have not previously been reported. Tesla declined to comment.
Tesla s new batteries will rely on innovations such as low-cobalt and cobalt-free battery chemistries, and the use of chemical additives, materials and coatings that will reduce internal stress and enable batteries to store more energy for longer periods, sources said.
Tesla also plans to implement new high-speed, heavily automated battery manufacturing processes designed to reduce labor costs and increase production in massive “terafactories” about 30 times the size of the company’s sprawling Nevada “gigafactory” — a strategy telegraphed in late April to analysts by Musk.
Tesla is working on recycling and recovery of such expensive metals as nickel, cobalt and lithium, through its Redwood  Materials affiliate, as well as new “second life” applications of electric vehicle batteries in grid storage systems, such as the one Tesla built in South Australia in 2017. The automaker also has said it wants to supply electricity to consumers and businesses, but has not provided details.
Reuters reported exclusively in February that Tesla was in advanced talks to use CATL’s lithium iron phosphate batteries, which use no cobalt, the most expensive metal in EV batteries.
CATL also has developed a simpler and less expensive way of packaging battery cells, called cell-to-pack, that eliminates the middle step of bundling cells. Tesla is expected to use the technology to help reduce battery weight and cost. 
The sources said CATL also plans to supply Tesla in China next year with an improved long-life nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery whose cathode is 50% nickel and only 20% cobalt.
Tesla now jointly produces nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) batteries with Panasonic (T:6752) at a “gigafactory” in Nevada, and buys NMC batteries from LG Chem (KS:051910) in China. Panasonic declined to comment. 
Taken together, the advances in battery technology, the strategy of expanding the ways in which EV batteries can be used and the manufacturing automation on a huge scale all aim at the same target: Reworking the financial math that until now has made buying an electric car more expensive for most consumers than sticking with carbon-emitting internal combustion vehicles.
“We ve got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of the batteries — this is very fundamental and extremely difficult,” Musk told investors in January. “We ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today.”
Tesla has reported operating profits for three quarters in a row, driving a near-doubling of its share price this year. Still, Musk s ambitious expansion plans depend on increasing both profit margins and sales volume.
A number of the technical advances made by Tesla and CATL in battery chemistry and design originated at a small research lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The lab has been run since 1996 by Jeff Dahn, a pioneer in the development of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and grid storage.
Dahn and his team began an exclusive five-year research partnership with Tesla in mid-2016, but the relationship dates back at least to 2012.
Among the critical contributions from Dahn’s lab: Chemical additives and nano-engineered materials to make lithium-ion batteries tougher and more resistant to bruising from stress such as rapid charging, thus extending their life.
The cost of CATL s cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate battery packs has fallen below $80 per kilowatt-hour, with the cost of the battery cells dropping below $60/kWh, the sources said. CATL’s low-cobalt NMC battery packs are close to $100/kWh. 
Auto industry executives have said $100/kWh for battery packs is the level at which electric vehicles reach rough parity with internal combustion competitors.
Battery expert Shirley Meng, a professor at the University of California San Diego, said NMC cells could cost as little as $80/kWh once recycling and recovery of key materials such as cobalt and nickel is factored in. Iron phosphate batteries, which are safer than NMC, could find a second life in stationary grid storage systems, reducing the upfront cost of those batteries for electric vehicle buyers. 
In comparison, the new low-cobalt batteries being jointly developed by General Motors Co  and LG Chem are not expected to reach those cost levels until 2025, according to a source familiar with the companies’ work.

GM declined to comment on its cost targets. Earlier this year, it said only that it planned to ""drive battery cell costs below $100/kWh"" without specifying a timetable."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower for a third straight day after data showing initial jobless claims fell more slowly than expected than last week, further stoking fears that the economy will struggle to rebound even as the country moves out of lockdown.
By 10:10 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 378 points or 1.6% at 22,870 points, its lowest in over a month. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.4%. 
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial jobless claims fell to 2.98 million last week - the first week since March that they ve been below 3 million but still considerably above expectations of 2.50 million.  The numbers took the total number of initial claims since the pandemic erupted to over 36 million, or one quarter of the workforce.
Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the numbers showed a disappointingly slow decline in the rate of new claims, and said the number is now unlikely to drop below 1 million before the end of June. 
""That said, the proportion of the previous week’s initial claims then appearing in the continuing claims numbers a week later has fallen for seven straight weeks, so hiring is not completely dead,"" Pantheon s Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients.
The market was also rocked early Thursday by more aggressive rhetoric toward China from President Donald Trump, reviving fears of the trade war that rocked markets last year. Trump told Fox Business News that: ""We could cut off the whole relationship"" with China, something he said would ""save"" the U.S. $500 billion a year. Fox also reported that the administration is looking for ways to punish or seek financial compensation from China for what it sees as withholding information about the coronavirus. 
Already this week, Trump has directed a federal pension program to divest its holdings of Chinese equities and signed an executive order extending a ban on U.S. companies doing business with telecoms company Huawei until the end of May 2021. 
That helped push names such as Apple , which manufactures its smartphones in China, down 1.7%, while Tesla  stock, which relies in large measure on the Chinese market for its growth outlook, fell 2.5%. 
Delta Air Lines  stock fell 8.9% after a Reuters report detailing the likely extent of overstaffing at the end of the third quarter. The company is currently not allowed to lay off staff as part of the conditions for its bailout from the federal government. United Airlines stock fell over 10% after a class action was filed by employees to stop it forcing them to take off 20 days as unpaid leave, something they said violated the bailout conditions.
Elsewhere, Grubhub   stock fell 8.3% and Uber  stock fell 3.6% as enthusiasm for their mooted combination cooled. "

The electric-car maker will construct the plant in or near Austin, Electrek said. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in March that Tesla was scouting for sites where it will build both the in-development Cybertruck and the Model Y crossover for customers on the East Coast.
Musk, 48, last week threatened to move Tesla’s headquarters and future programs to Texas or Nevada after a California county blocked the carmaker from reopening its factory in the San Francisco Bay area. The company restarted production within days in defiance of county health officials.
Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck in November, with Musk pitching it as a radically different option from the highly lucrative pickups produced by established automakers. A botched demonstration during which the company’s design chief cracked what were supposed to be shatter-proof glass generated enormous publicity.

(Reuters) - A California state panel on Friday rejected a request from Elon Musk s SpaceX for $655,500 in state job and training funds, citing the chief executive s recent threats to move Tesla , the electric carmaker that he also runs, out of the state. 
The snub comes as Musk has sparred with officials in Alameda County over his plans to resume production at the Tesla plant there, which was stopped because of the coronavirus. 
Five members of California s Employment Training Panel voted to reject the proposal and two voted for it, with one member absent, after discussing Musk s tweets on Tesla s reopening and media reports of layoffs at SpaceX s Hawthorne, California headquarters in recent years. 
""In my opinion, given the recent threats of the CEO to leave the state of California, and everything else we’ve discussed today, this proposal does not rise to the level for me to feel secure in supporting it,"" said Gretchen Newsom, a panel member and the political director of an IBEW electrical workers union local.
""SpaceX is a different company, but they have the same CEO,"" said Newsom, who is not related to California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Though a small amount of money, the funding was opposed by organized labor groups. Tesla and SpaceX are both nonunion shops. 
The funding from the state employment development fund was supposed to help SpaceX train 900 employees for its Starlink satellite project and hire 300 to work on its Starship program. It was unclear whether SpaceX intends to move forward with its hiring plan after Friday s rejection. 
SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Since the disagreement between Tesla and Alameda County gained national attention, officials from such states as Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Utah and Oklahoma have pitched Musk about considering their state for existing operations or for a new factory the company has promised. "

DUBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund has bought minority stakes in major American companies including Boeing , Facebook  and  Citigroup  , a regulatory filing showed, giving it a portfolio of nearly $10 billion in U.S.-listed stocks.
The $300 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying minority stakes in companies across the world, taking advantage of market weakness in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
The PIF disclosed stakes worth $713.7 million in Boeing, ABOUT $522 million in Citigroup, $522 million in Facebook, $495.8 million in Disney and $487.6 million in Bank of America , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing https:// on Friday showed. 
The PIF has a nearly $514 million stake in Marriott and a small holding in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), according to the filing. The PIF also disclosed an $827.7 million stake in oil company BP , which has American Depository Receipts (ADRs) listed in the United States.
""The Saudi sovereign fund went shopping in Q1,"" tweeted Ali Al-Salim, co-founder of Dubai-based consulting firm Arkan Partners, adding that it now held about $10 billion in U.S.-listed equities, up from $2 billion at the start of the year.
PIF s strategy is two-pronged; building an international portfolio of investments and investing locally in projects that will help reduce Saudi Arabia s reliance on oil.
""PIF is a patient investor with a long-term horizon. As such, we actively seek strategic opportunities both in Saudi Arabia and globally that have strong potential to generate significant long-term returns while further benefiting the people of Saudi Arabia and driving the country s economic growth,"" the sovereign wealth fund said in a statement. 
""These opportunities include sectors and companies that are well positioned to drive economies and lead sectors moving forward.""
ENERGY GIANTS
The PIF has separately funded almost half of Japanese investor SoftBank s $100 billion Vision Fund, which has been hit by losses on technology bets.
Last month the PFI s head, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said it was looking into investment opportunities in areas such as aviation, oil and gas, and entertainment, adding that there would be a lot of potential for investment opportunities once the coronavirus crisis passes.
The PIF disclosed an 8.2% stake in coronavirus-hit Carnival  Corp in April, sending the cruise operator s shares nearly 30% higher. 
The Saudi fund bought stakes in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Total, Eni and Equinor earlier this year , a source familiar with the transactions told Reuters on April 9.
The SEC filing on Friday showed it had a $483.6 million stake in Shell, a $222.3 million holding in Total and a $481 million stake in Suncor Energy . 
An earlier filing in Norway had shown the PIF had a 0.3% stake in oil and gas firm Equinor.
PIF already has a $2 billion stake in Uber Technologies  and electric car company Lucid Motors. It used to own a small stake in electric carmaker Tesla , but the latest filing did not show any exposure.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic  Corp s (T:6752) finance chief said the company is seeing strong demand for battery cells from U.S. partner Tesla  and they are in talks to expand their joint plant in Nevada, which is now profitable.
The positive outlook comes after production troubles and delays at Tesla strained the company s partnership with Panasonic over the past few years.
Panasonic recently lost its status as Tesla s exclusive battery supplier, but has been able to turn around the U.S. joint battery business as demand for Tesla s electric cars soar.
Last month Tesla reported its third consecutive quarterly profit despite the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, taking investors by surprise.
""We are seeing strong demand from Tesla"" beyond the Nevada plant s current capacity of 35 gigawatt hours per year, Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda told an earnings briefing on Monday. ""We are in discussions right now"" about expanding the plant s capacity, he said.
The plant made a profit in January-March for the second consecutive quarter, he said.
Umeda hinted that Panasonic has been developing new batteries with Tesla. ""We will be working to improve materials and technologies throughout this financial year,"" he said.
The Tesla battery business provided a bright spot in Panasonic s otherwise grim earnings, hit by plant closures and supply chain disruptions for its laptops, washing machines, automotive components and factory equipment.
The group s operating profit for the year ended in March dropped 29% to 294 billion yen ($2.7 billion).
Panasonic did not issue an earnings forecast for the current year due to uncertainty about the impact of the virus, joining a number of Japanese electronics companies, including Sony Corp (T:6758) and Canon Inc (T:7751), in refraining from providing outlooks.
Analysts have forecast an average 225.46 billion yen profit for the current financial year.
The company has been cautious about expanding its partnership with Tesla, as its $1.6 billion investment in the Nevada factory, which began construction in 2014, failed to produce solid returns. It did not make a profit until the October-December quarter of last year. 
Panasonic has decided to exit solar cell production at Tesla s New York plant this year.
It also decided not to build a new battery plant for Tesla in China. The U.S. car maker has entered into partnerships with South Korea s LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) and China s CATL (SZ:300750).
Umeda said at the briefing that Panasonic has been supplying batteries to Tesla s factory in China from their Nevada plant.

YUYAO, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In the eastern Chinese city of Yuyao, a group of five face-masked workers at a Geely auto plant, stood almost shoulder to shoulder behind an SUV as they conducted paint and other quality checks.
That scene would not have been possible a month ago.
But Reuters visits to six factories including those operated by  Daimler  AG s (DE:DAIGn) China venture and Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics (T:6723) showed manufacturers in China have begun to ease strict physical distancing rules as the coronavirus outbreak is now contained. China s daily new coronavirus cases have recently dropped to single digits.
The most significant rule to be relaxed - in line with an easing of guidelines by local governments - has been the requirement that production line workers stand at least 1 metre apart. That rule was put in place by many authorities in February when the outbreak was at its height in China but it was also a rule that auto industry insiders said had hamstrung productivity.
""Workers need to work together to check the quality of the job,"" Shen Qingguang, safety manager at Geely s Yuyao plant where some 1,000 workers build sport utility vehicles for its Lynk & Co marque, told Reuters.
Employees often need to work together on the final assembly line in particular, he added. But where working close together is not deemed necessary, the 1 metre rule still applies and Geely office staff must work 1.5 metres apart.
North American auto plants began reopening this week, introducing temperature monitors for those entering plants, personal protective equipment such as face masks and shields, as well as revamped and deep-cleaned factory floors that emphasise social distancing.
Manufacturers in China are, however, several weeks or in some cases months ahead in terms of reopening, providing a window into how worker practices could evolve. That said, restrictions will vary by country and region.
For Tesla Inc s  Shanghai plant, workers were required to maintain a distance of 1 metre in February but like many other China plants, that rule has now been eased.
In contrast, Tesla s ""Return to Work Playbook"" published this month for its Fremont, California factory calls for workers to maintain a distance of 6 feet or 2 metres, or for barriers to be established where that is not possible.
At Beijing Benz Automotive Co, a Daimler  venture with China s BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL], the 1 metre rule has also been relaxed for production line staff and workers wearing face masks could be seen working near each other. 
A noticeboard showed weekly production for one line making E-Class sedans, GLC sport utility vehicles and other models had jumped to over 4,000 vehicles from 1,100 in early February.
Indeed, Chinese auto production is by and large back on track, climbing 2.3% in April from the same month a year earlier to 2.1 million vehicles. Vehicle sales also grew, up 4.4% for their first rise in 22 months. Geely said its Yuyao plant had managed to return to full capacity in early March. 
Many strict measures are, however, still in place. At all six plants visited by Reuters, face masks are compulsory - even though some smaller Chinese cities have begun to relax rules about wearing them. Workers must also have their temperatures checked daily and factories are regularly disinfected.
All of the plants visited, which included plants operated by Japan s  SMC Corp  (T:6273), which supplies equipment for production lines, Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (SS:600699) - a maker of electronic and safety gear for cars, and Hongyu Electric, a wire supplier for vehicles, said they have not had a case of a coronavirus infection since February.
At Geely s Yuyao plant, rules have also been relaxed for lunch. Previously, workers had to sit on chairs far apart near the production line, all facing one way with their backs to each other.
Now they are allowed back in the canteen, with two workers allowed to sit at a table for four, seated diagonally apart. There are no barriers on the table but sitting directly opposite each other or side by side is still forbidden. Hongyu Electric has introduced similar rules.
Shen, the Geely safety manager, said staff at the Yuyao plant adjusted to wearing masks and ""new normal"" work practices quickly.
""Everyone wants to be safe,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies may be facing uncertainty as the coronavirus pandemic triggers a collapse in demand for their products, but auto makers are betting the crisis will help accelerate an electric future.
With economies reeling from lockdowns to curb the virus, the sharpest plunge in oil prices in two decades has slashed the cost of filling up a tank of gas, eroding some of the incentive to make the switch to cleaner fuels.
Looking ahead, cuts in capital spending forced upon energy companies as their revenues crumble could tighten supply enough to cause a spike in oil prices, making electric vehicles more attractive just as automakers ramp up production, analysts say.
""We think this will lead to a tipping point, accelerating the switch to electric vehicles in many more countries around 2023-24,"" Per Magnus Nysveen, senior partner at Rystad Energy, a consultancy in Oslo, told Reuters.
""We will start to see that this starts to dig into global oil demand in a very significant way,"" he said.
According to a Reuters analysis of 27 automakers compiled in partnership with Constellation Research & Technology, most companies apart from Elon Musk s Tesla Inc  and China s BYD Co  Ltd (SZ:002594) are still in the early stages of transitioning to EVs, which make up a fraction of global sales. 
(For an interactive graphic on business model transformation and decarbonization within the auto manufacturing sector, see: https://graphics.reuters.com/DATA-ESG/AUTOS/ygdpzylllvw/index.html)
With mid-sized to large petroleum-fuelled SUVs and trucks driving much of the recent growth in the auto sector, many companies are banking on these high-emitting gas-guzzlers to drive their near-term performance.
Nevertheless, with China s BAIC Motor Corp (HK:1958) and German rivals Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) pursuing some of the industry s most ambitious decarbonisation targets, investors are increasingly using a company s EV prospects as a proxy for future success.
""All the growth in transportation is being eaten by electricity,"" said Harry Benham, chairman of Ember-Climate, a British energy transition think-tank. ""Oil and gas companies have got no ability to defeat electricity as a transport fuel."" 
PEAK OIL DEMAND?
With fuel for road transport accounting for about half of all oil demand, the possibility of a faster-than-expected switch to EVs in the wake of the pandemic is one of the main reasons some forecasts for a peak have been brought forward.
Global oil demand hit a record of just over 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019. Rystad now sees demand topping out at 106.5 million-107 million bpd in 2027-2028. The consultancy had previously forecast a marginally higher peak in 2030.
Although the oil industry has defied numerous attempts to call ""peak oil"" in the past, the fact that the International Energy Agency projects that demand will plunge by a record 8.6 million bpd this year has reignited the debate.
Though as yet a minority view, some believe the pandemic is reshaping patterns of work, aviation and commuting so profoundly that oil demand might never return to 2019 levels - a potential boost to hopes of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.
""It s inconceivable that all that demand for oil comes back in one go, so the real question is how much of that is lost permanently,"" said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas  Asset Management.
Underscoring the changing economics of transport, Reuters revealed last week that Tesla plans to introduce a new low-cost, long-life battery in its Model 3 sedan in China that it expects to bring the cost of EVs in line with gasoline models.
Despite such potential breakthroughs, the Constellation data shows that automakers still have a long way to go to align themselves with climate goals enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, with  Ford Motor Co   and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles  among the biggest laggards. 
Volkswagen has announced some of the most aggressive long-term plans to decarbonise its fleet, but the company still has to prove it can build EVs at scale, and has led the field in ramping up sales of mid- and large SUVs, the data shows.
Although the public decarbonisation targets of Japan s Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) are only a little bolder than the industry average, the company s proven capacity to build hybrids may bode well for its EV ambitions, the data suggests.
Japan s Subaru Corp (T:7270), which produces only a small number of hybrid vehicles, might have to rely on its partnership with Toyota if it wants to prosper as demand for EVs picks up, Constellation analysts said.
 CRISIS OF UNCERTAINTY 
Although the oil industry hopes to offset demand lost to EVs with a growing appetite for crude to make petrochemicals and plastics, companies facing growing pressure from investors over climate change are increasingly open about the risks.
In April, Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), said the company did not expect oil demand to recover in the medium term, saying the industry was living in a ""crisis of uncertainty"". 
Bernard Looney, chief executive of  BP  , was later quoted in the Financial Times as saying he would not ""write off"" the possibility the world had reached peak oil.
Much will depend on whether economies stage a V-shaped recovery, as some forecasters predict, and how far governments adopt new EV targets as part of ""green stimulus"" packages to spur a faster shift to a low-carbon future.
With many European politicians calling for green recoveries, the French government signalled on Monday that the country wants to boost sales of low-emission cars. China has extended backing for EVs as part of its recovery package, and U.S. Democrats are exploring ways to boost demand for clean vehicles.
With various European countries planning to ultimately ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars, some see increasingly ambitious EV commitments by automakers as another sign of the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.
""One of the primary factors holding back the transition has been resistance by the fossil fuel incumbents,"" said Kingsmill Bond, senior strategist at financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. ""Now those incumbents are significantly weakened.""

(Reuters) - General Motors Co  is ""almost there"" on developing an electric vehicle battery that will last one million miles, a top executive said on Tuesday.
The automaker also is working on next-generation batteries even more advanced than the new Ultium battery that it unveiled in March, according to GM Executive Vice President Doug Parks, who was speaking at an online investor conference. 
He did not specify a timeline for introduction of the million-mile battery, but said ""multiple teams"" at GM are working on such advances as zero-cobalt electrodes, solid state electrolytes and ultra-fast charging.
Current electric vehicle batteries typically last 100,000 to 200,000 miles.
Reuters reported exclusively in early May that Tesla , in partnership with Chinese battery maker CATL, plans to introduce its own million-mile battery later this year or early next.
CATL provides battery cells to other vehicle manufacturers, and has supply agreements in China with GM and its local partner SAIC Motor.
GM unveiled its Ultium advanced battery system in March. On Tuesday, it said its $2.3 billion battery production joint venture in Ohio with Korean partner LG Chem will be called Ultium Cells LLC.
GM and LG Chem are pursuing a variety of ways to reduce battery costs, Adam Kwiatkowski, executive chief engineer of GM s electric propulsion systems, told another online investor conference on Tuesday.
The partners are investigating such initiatives as investing in mines, hedging metals prices and partnering with metals refiners, he said.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra reiterated earlier this year that the automaker intends to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year in 2025 in the United States and China."

BERLIN (Reuters) - China last year dropped out of the top three foreign investors in Germany for the first time in more than a decade, official German data seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday, as the Chinese government focuses on boosting the domestic economy.
Figures compiled by Germany Trade & Invest (GTAI), a government institution, reveal that China is now the fourth largest contributor of foreign direct investment to Germany, behind the United States, Britain and Switzerland.
GTAI managing director Robert Hermann linked the drop to an economic strategy promoted by the Chinese government that focuses on stimulating the domestic economy with investments in infrastructure as well as in research and development.
""The Chinese government regulates capital exports,"" Hermann said. ""It s increasingly focused on boosting investments domestically.""
The data showed that the United States remains the largest investor in Germany with 302 projects last year, followed by Britain with 185 and Switzerland with 184.
China, which was the third-largest investor in Germany in 2018, dropped to fourth place for the first time since 2009, when GTAI started compiling the data.
Britain rose from fourth place to become the second-largest foreign investor in Germany as companies alarmed that Brexit will hamper access to the European Union s single market set up affiliates in Europe s largest economy.
The data showed that 1,851 foreign companies moved to Germany last year, 10% less than a year earlier. But the number of jobs they planned to create almost doubled to 42,000.
Foreign car and battery makers are driving the job boom created by foreign direct investment, Hermann said.
U.S. electric car maker Tesla  plans to build its European factory outside Berlin, Chinese carmaker Geely wants to set up an innovation centre south of Frankfurt, and Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750) is planning a factory in eastern Germany.
GTAI expect foreign investments to fall this year as the coronavirus pandemic sinks the world economy into a recession."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged the recently ousted owner of a Hollywood movie distributor with defrauding a federal coronavirus emergency relief program and a BlackRock Inc  investment fund, including to pay for a Beverly Hills mansion and other luxuries.
Prosecutors said William Sadleir, 66, diverted much of the $1.7 million of loans he received on May 1 from the Paycheck Protection Program for personal expenses.
He allegedly did this after falsely telling JPMorgan Chase  & Co and the Small Business Administration the funds were meant for his former company Aviron Group, which had terminated him in December and where he has no current role.
The PPP was meant ""to help small businesses stay afloat during the financial crisis, and we will act swiftly against those who abuse the program for their own personal gain,"" U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles said in a statement.
Sadleir was also accused of having previously induced the closed-end BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust Fund to invest $75 million in Aviron to support its films.
Prosecutors said he then created a sham company to conceal his use of the money, and assumed the fake identity ""Amanda Stevens"" to communicate by email with the BlackRock fund about its investment.
In a related civil case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Sadleir s ""lavish lifestyle"" also included a $127,000 Tesla .
A lawyer for Sadleir could not immediately be identified. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.
Aviron s films have included Halle Berry s ""Kidnap"" and Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway s ""Serenity.""
The BlackRock fund had $574 million of assets as of May 21, and normally invests most assets in debt and loans. It sued Sadleir for fraud in a New York state court in December.

Sadleir faces up to 124 years in prison if convicted on all charges."

(Reuters) - A group representing some of the largest U.S. employers has asked Congress for a year-long ban on mergers and acquisitions among hospitals and doctors groups that received government money to cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Pacific Business Group on Health, whose members include Boeing , Salesforce , Tesla , and Walmart , said in a letter addressed to congressional leaders this week that it feared that further consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to higher costs.
Physician practices’ revenues have plummeted across the United States since shutdowns were imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, as patients stay home except for emergencies. 
Even before the pandemic, well-funded hospital systems were taking over smaller doctors groups and hospitals to increase market share.
PBGH said it fears these larger players will be even better positioned to buy struggling practices coming out of the crisis, raising healthcare prices for employers. The group asked for a year-long M&A ban for any healthcare provider receiving any of the $170 billion government relief approved for the industry. 
""Anti-competitive practices are increasingly concerning to large employers. What we’re seeing happening right now is the collapse of independent primary care,"" Elizabeth Mitchell, chief executive officer of PBGH, told Reuters.Politicians and regulators have already been scrutinizing mergers in the hospital industry. 

The Federal Trade Commission moved to block a merger between two Pennsylvania hospitals in February, on the grounds that consolidation would mean the systems would have fewer incentives to keep costs down."

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Entrepreneur Elon Musk s SpaceX is set to launch two American astronauts to the International Space Station on Wednesday from NASA s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, ending the U.S. space agency s nine-year hiatus in human spaceflight.
California-based SpaceX s Crew Dragon capsule carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken and its Falcon 9 rocket is due to lift off at 4:33 p.m. EDT (2033 GMT) on Wednesday from the same launch pad used by NASA s last space shuttle mission in 2011.
President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will view the launch in person, a White House spokesman said.
For Musk, SpaceX and NASA, a safe flight would mark a milestone in the quest to produce reusable spacecraft that can make space travel more affordable. Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX and CEO of Tesla  Inc. 
""Bob and I have been working on this program for five years, day in and day out,"" Hurley, 53, said as he and Behnken, 49, arrived at the Kennedy Space Center from Houston last week. ""It s been a marathon in many ways, and that s what you d expect to develop a human-rated space vehicle that can go to and from the International Space Station.""
NASA, hoping to stimulate a commercial space marketplace, awarded $3.1 billion to SpaceX and $4.5 billion to Boeing  Co to develop dueling space capsules, experimenting with a contract model that allows the space agency to buy astronaut seats from the two companies. 
Boeing s CST-100 Starliner capsule is not expected to launch its first crew until 2021.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared the mission a ""go"" last week at Kennedy Space Center after space agency and SpaceX officials convened for final engineering checks.

SpaceX successfully tested Crew Dragon without astronauts last year in its first orbital mission to the space station. That vehicle was destroyed the following month during a ground test when one of the valves for its abort system burst, causing an explosion that triggered a nine-month engineering investigation that ended in January."

HONG KONG/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) is in final talks to seal its largest investment deals with Chinese electric vehicle (EV) firms, two sources said, as the German automaker accelerates its push into the world s largest market for environmentally friendlier cars.
The firm is poised to buy 50% of Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Holding, the parent of EV partner JAC Motors (SS:600418), for at least 3.5 billion yuan ($491 million), the people said on condition of anonymity as the matter was private.
It is also set to become the biggest shareholder of EV battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd (SZ:002074), the people said, adding both deals could be announced as early as Friday.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the deals, details of which are reported here for the first time. JAC and Guoxuan declined to comment. 
The deals highlight how Volkswagen is keen to retain its status as the largest foreign automaker in China even as government virus-busting measures decimate sales, in the face of encroaching rivals such as Tesla Inc  which last year became the first foreign automaker to wholly own a car plant.
At the end of last year when 25 million vehicles were sold in China - and just before the coronavirus was first reported in December - the government targeted 25% of 2025 annual vehicle sales to be made up of new energy vehicles.
The deals would make Volkswagen the latest foreign automaker to increase ownership in China since the government started to relax ownership rules in 2018 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-regulation/china-to-open-auto-market-as-trade-tensions-simmer-idUSKBN1HO0YA, with Germany s BMW AG  quick to take control of its main local venture.
Volkswagen target Anhui Jianghuai, based in the eastern city of Hefei, is fully state owned. It counts its core asset as its 25.23% stake in JAC - formally Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp Ltd, which has a market value of $1.84 billion.
The Anhui provincial office of the State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission declined to comment.
After completing the deal, Volkswagen plans to invest fresh capital in its 50:50 venture with JAC and build capacity with its modular MEB platform, an architecture enabling efficient production of various EV models, said one of the people.
JAC shares surged by their maximum 10% on the news on Wednesday, to trade at their highest level since mid-April last year.
Shanghai-listed JAC last week said its parent planned to bring in a strategic investor, which will not cause change in its control.
Volkswagen s purchase of a stake in Shenzhen-listed Guoxuan, also based in Hefei, would mark it first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker.
It plans to buy about 27% of Guoxuan mostly via a discounted private share placement as well as from top shareholder Zhuhai Guoxuan Trading Ltd, which holds 18%, and founder Li Zhen, who owns 12%, said one of the people. Son Li Chen also owns 2.5%, showed filings to the stock exchange this month.
Based on Guoxuan s market capitalisation of $4.3 billion, a 27% stake is worth $1.16 billion.
Zhuhai Guoxuan and Li Zhen could not immediately be reached for comment.
Guoxuan has suspended trading of its stock since May 20 and on Tuesday said Zhuhai Guoxuan and Li Zhen would sell part of their holdings to an unidentified strategic investor. It said it will also issue shares to the investor via a private offering.
The deals have yet to be finalised and investment sizes may change as negotiations continue, the people said.
Volkswagen also has ventures with state-owned China FAW Group Corp Ltd and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104). It aims to sell 1.5 million new energy vehicles a year in China by 2025. 

""Volkswagen consistently searches for ways to strengthen and deepen our relationships with local partners,"" Volkswagen told Reuters. ""In this regard we will explore possible options together with all stakeholders to secure long-term success."""

Tesla also said its Supercharger quick-charging service will no longer be free to new customers of its Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles (SUVs).
Auto retail sales in the United States likely halved in April from a year earlier, showed data from J.D. Power. However, sales in May are likely to improve due to pent-up demand and incentives offered by most carmakers, the analytics firm said.
Automakers including General Motors Co ,  Ford Motor Co   and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV  , are offering 0% financing rates and deferred payment options for new purchases.
Factories in the United States started to reopen earlier this month with suppliers gearing up to support an auto industry employing nearly 1 million people. 
Tesla was briefly forced to stop work at its Fremont, California, factory due to stay-at-home orders. It resumed production after resolving a dispute over safety measures with local authorities.
On Wednesday, Tesla website s showed the starting price for its Model S sedan is now $74,990, down from $79,990.
Its Model X SUVs are now priced at $79,990, from $84,990, and the lowest-priced Model 3 sedan is $2,000 cheaper at $37,990. 
Tesla said it will also cut prices in China - as per usual after price adjustments in the United States - by around 4% for the Model X and Model S.

Tesla China, which is delivering Model 3 sedans from its Shanghai factory, in a Weibo  post said it has also cut prices for the Model S and Model X cars it imports, but will keep prices of locally made Model 3 cars unchanged."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China s top electric vehicle (EV) battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) is exploring new battery-related services and will expand manufacturing capacity in the next two years, its chairman told Reuters.
Ningde-based CATL, which alongside LG Chem and Panasonic  is one of the biggest EV battery makers globally, is developing battery-swapping and battery maintenance services, its chairman Zeng Yuqun said on Wednesday.
It will also expand recycling capabilities in China and invest in similar businesses overseas, Zeng added in a written response to Reuters questions.
The firm, which has signed supply deals with Tesla  Inc and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), expects to increase battery manufacturing capacity in the next two years, Zeng said. 
It may target further overseas expansion based on customer demand, he added. The firm is currently building a plant in Germany.
Zeng said the firm will control costs to better manage the impact from the coronavirus pandemic. He did not offer details.
As the virus hit demand in China, the world s biggest auto market, sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, fell 43% in the first four months this year compared to a year earlier.

Reuters reported in February that Tesla is in advanced talks to use lithium iron phosphate batteries from CATL. Sources said this month Tesla and CATL are developing next generation batteries which would have significantly longer lifespans."

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Stormy weather thwarted a landmark moment for private rocket company SpaceX and NASA on Wednesday, forcing launch directors in Florida to postpone what would have been the first flight of U.S. astronauts into orbit from American soil in nine years.
The countdown, made especially suspenseful by shifting weather conditions, was halted just 16 minutes and 54 seconds before the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket had been due to launch astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a 19-hour ride to the International Space Station.
SpaceX will make a second attempt on Saturday afternoon to launch the astronauts aboard its newly designed Dragon Crew capsule.
The presence of visiting dignitaries, including President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and billionaire SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk added to the high-pressure mood at the Kennedy Space Center.
In the end, it was an electrically charged atmosphere, literally, that prompted SpaceX and NASA to scrub the launch, even as the rocket was being loaded with fuel.
LIGHTNING THREAT
""There wasn t really a lightning storm, but there was a concern that if we did launch it could trigger lightning,"" NASA chief Jim Bridenstine explained afterwards.
Launch director Mike Taylor cited a number of unspecified ""weather violations"" for halting the mission, capping a day of intermittent showers and a tornado warning.
Still, Bridenstine sounded an upbeat note, calling the aborted countdown a valuable ""wet dress rehearsal.""
""This was an important milestone, just today,"" he said on NASA TV. ""We learn a lot every time we do these things.""
Hurley, 53, and Behnken, 49, had been strapped into their seats for a little over two hours before the launch was called off. NASA s broadcast on the internet showed the two men seated side by side in helmeted white flight suits as the postponement was announced.
""Everybody did great today. It was a great practice, and we ll do it again on Saturday,"" Hurley said just before climbing out of the capsule.
Technicians in black suits and face masks then escorted the two astronauts back down the 265-foot-tall (80-meter) launch tower for the return trip to their quarantine holding facility.
The astronauts were to have blasted off from the same launch pad used in 2011 by NASA s final space shuttle flight, which was piloted by Hurley. Since then, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides into orbit aboard Russia s Soyuz spacecraft.
For Musk, who is also CEO of electric carmaker Tesla Inc , the first manned SpaceX launch represents another milestone for the reusable rockets his company pioneered to make space flight less costly. SpaceX, founded by Musk in 2002 and formally known as Space Exploration Technologies, has never previously flown humans into orbit, only cargo.
It also would mark the first time commercially developed space vehicles - owned and operated by a private entity rather than NASA - have carried Americans into orbit.
NASA has awarded nearly $8 billion combined to SpaceX and  Boeing Co   for development of rival space launch systems.
The last time NASA launched astronauts into space aboard a brand new vehicle was four decades ago at the outset of the shuttle program.
The two astronauts are NASA employees under contract to fly with Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX. Plans call for them to remain at the space station for several weeks, assisting a short-handed crew aboard the orbital laboratory.
Wednesday s outcome was a disappointment for Trump, who made the trip to Florida for what he hoped would showcase a triumphant moment for America as the nation battles the coronavirus pandemic. 

The president left Cape Canaveral shortly after the countdown was halted but said he would return on Saturday."

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) plans to boost its electric push in China, the world s biggest auto market, by pumping 2.1 billion euros in two Chinese electric vehicle players.
The deals come as global rivals such as General Motors , Toyota and Tesla  Inc seek to expand electric sales in the Chinese car market. 
Volkswagen said it will invest 1 billion euros to take a 50% stake in the state-owned parent of Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group (JAC Motors), also taking full management control of the its existing electric vehicle joint venture with JAC by raising its stake to 75% from 50%.
Volkswagen s China chief Stephan Woellenstein told reporters on Friday the venture planned to revamp one existing JAC plant and launch its first electric model based on its MEB platform, an architecture enabling efficient production of various EV models, in 2023. 
The joint venture will launch five more electric models by 2025, when the German giant aims to sell 1.5 million new energy vehicles (NEV) - including battery electric cars as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles - a year in China.
In a separate transaction, Volkswagen will pay 1.1 billion euros to acquire 26.5% of Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd, a maker of electric vehicle batteries, becoming its biggest shareholder. Volkswagen said Guoxuan, based in Hefei like JAC, will supply batteries to its EV models in China.
Woellenstein said Anhui province, where Hefei is located, will be Volkswagen s EV manufacturing hub in China. The Wolfsburg-based automaker has not changed its EV strategy in China after the global gasoline market tumbled, he said. 
He added China s overall auto sales in the second half of this year will be level with same period last year. Volkswagen China s full-year sales will be lower than last year due to the sales loss in the first months.
Reuters exclusively reported on Wednesday that VW was in final talks to invest in the two companies.
China has set a target of 25% of 2025 annual vehicle sales to be made up of NEVs. More than 25 million vehicles were sold in China last year.
Friday s moves also make Volkswagen the latest foreign automaker to increase ownership of operations in China since the government started to relax rules in 2018, with German peer BMW AG quick to take control of its main local venture.
Tesla last year became the first foreign automaker to wholly own a car plant in China.
Volkswagen also has ventures with state-owned China FAW Group Corp Ltd [SASACJ.UL] and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd. 
Shares in both JAC and Guoxuan climbed their maximum daily limit of 10% on Friday morning. Volkswagen s shares fell 3%.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - SpaceX, the private rocket company of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched two Americans into orbit from Florida on Saturday in a landmark mission marking the first spaceflight of NASA astronauts from U.S. soil in nine years.
A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 3:22 p.m. EDT (1922 GMT), launching Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a 19-hour ride aboard the company s newly designed Crew Dragon capsule bound for the International Space Station.
Just before liftoff, Hurley said, “SpaceX, we’re go for launch. Let’s light this candle,” paraphrasing the famous comment uttered on the launch pad in 1961 by Alan Shepard, the first American flown into space. 
Minutes after launch, the first-stage booster rocket of the Falcon 9 separated from the upper second-stage rocket and flew itself back to Earth to descend safely onto a landing platform floating in the Atlantic.
High above the Earth, the Crew Dragon jettisoned moments later from the second-stage rocket, sending the capsule on its way to the space station.
The exhilarating spectacle of the rocket soaring flawlessly into the heavens came as a welcome triumph for a nation gripped by racially-charged civil unrest as well as ongoing fear and economic upheaval from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Falcon 9 took off from the same launch pad used by NASA s final space shuttle flight, piloted by Hurley, in 2011. Since then, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides into orbit aboard Russia s Soyuz spacecraft.
“It s incredible, the power, the technology,” said U.S. President Donald Trump, who was at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida for the launch. “That was a beautiful sight to see.”
The mission s first launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes remaining on the countdown clock. Weather again threatened Saturday s launch, but cleared in time to proceed with the mission.
SPACEFLIGHT MILESTONES
NASA chief Jim Bridenstine has said resuming launches of American astronauts on American-made rockets from U.S. soil is the space agency s top priority.
""I m breathing a sigh of relief, but I will also tell you I m not gonna celebrate until Bob and Doug are home safely."" Bridenstine said.
For Musk, the launch represents another milestone for the reusable rockets his company pioneered to make spaceflight less costly and more frequent. And it marks the first time commercially developed space vehicles - owned and operated by a private entity rather than NASA - have carried Americans into orbit.
The last time NASA launched astronauts into space aboard a brand new vehicle was 40 years ago at the start of the space shuttle program.
Musk, the South African-born high-tech entrepreneur who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, is also chief executive of electric carmaker and battery manufacturer Tesla  Inc. He founded Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies, in 2002. 
Hurley, 53, and Behnken, 49, NASA employees under contract to fly with SpaceX, are expected to remain at the space station for several weeks, assisting a short-handed crew aboard the orbital laboratory.
Boeing  Co, producing its own launch system in competition with SpaceX, is expected to fly its CST-100 Starliner vehicle with astronauts aboard for the first time next year. NASA has awarded nearly $8 billion combined to SpaceX and Boeing for development of their rival rockets.
Trump also hailed the launch as a major advance toward the goal of eventually sending humans to Mars.
He was joined at the viewing by Musk, as well as Vice President Mike Pence, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Senator Rick Scott.
Earlier on Saturday, the crew bid goodbye to their families. Prior to climbing into a specially designed Tesla automobile for the ride to the launch site, Behnken told his young son, ""Be good for mom. Make her life easy.”

During the drive, Behnken and Hurley passed former astronaut Garrett Reisman who held a sign saying, ""Take me with you."""

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Nearly 24 hours after launching from Florida, SpaceX s Crew Dragon capsule delivered NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station on Sunday, marking the first U.S. space capsule to do so with a crew since 2011.
The space station s current crew welcomed them aboard with hugs and handshakes on schedule at 1:25 p.m. EDT, after executing a critical spacecraft docking milestone and kicking off the crew s potentially months-long stay in the orbital laboratory.
Applause could be heard from the station s downlink to mission control in Houston, Texas as Behnken, 49, and Hurley 53, became the first American astronauts launched to the station from U.S. soil in nearly a decade.
""I will tell you, the whole world saw this mission, and we are so, so proud for everything you have done for our country and in fact to inspire the world,"" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said on a phone line through mission control. 
""It s great to get the United States back in the crewed launch business, and we re just really glad to be on board this magnificent complex,"" Hurley said. 
Saturday s launch by SpaceX, the private rocket company of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, represented another milestone for the reusable rockets it pioneered to make spaceflight less costly and more frequent. 
It also marked the first time that commercially developed space vehicles - owned and operated by a private entity rather than NASA - have carried Americans into orbit.
Behnken said he and Hurley were able to get a few hours  sleep during their 19-hour orbital journey, telling the administrator that ""the first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon is a slick vehicle and we had good airflow so we had an excellent evening.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned by China s Geely, plans a big expansion of its showroom network in the mainland, sources said, as it prepares for delivery of cars to compete with Tesla Inc s  locally made Model 3.
Showroom strength is becoming an important differentiator for electric vehicle (EV) makers in the world s biggest auto and EV market, as they line up new model launches.
Polestar, which plans to deliver Polestar 2 electric sedans in China from July, currently has one showroom, in the capital Beijing. It plans to have 20 showrooms, with most of them opening in the third quarter of this year.
Unlike sales of cars through dealers that most traditional automakers rely on, Polestar will sell directly to customers, a strategy also pursued by other EV makers including Tesla, Nio Inc  and Xpeng Motors, backed by  Alibaba  . 
Direct sales to customers can help automakers to better manage a car s retail price and its production and inventory. However, it also adds to costs if automakers need to invest in self-owned showrooms like Tesla.
Polestar, however, will partner with investors to build and operate the showrooms while still managing sales and delivery of cars, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the plan is not public.
A Polestar representative declined to comment.
The automaker, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, started producing Polestar 2 sedans earlier this year in China and will also export them to Europe and the United States.
It will open showrooms firstly in Shanghai and then expand to coastal Ningbo, northern Tianjin and southern Guangzhou. The showrooms will be mostly in shopping malls.

In China, Tesla has over 50 showrooms. Nio currently operates around 110 showrooms, with some of the properties belonging to partners. Xpeng plans to have over 200 outlets by the end of the year from about 150 now, many of them belonging to partners."

Showroom strength is becoming an important differentiator for electric vehicle (EV) makers in the world s biggest auto and EV market, as they line up model launches.
The automaker plans to export Polestar 2 sedans to Europe and the United States, and will open showrooms first in Shanghai and then expand to coastal Ningbo and southern Guangzhou. The showrooms will be mostly in shopping malls.

Reuters had reported Polestar s China showroom network expansion plan on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors  will ""work very closely"" with Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750) as it ramps up electric production in the world s biggest auto market, a senior executive said.
The Detroit automaker said in March it would invest $20 billion by 2025 in electric and automated vehicles as it races to catch up with Elon Musk s Tesla Inc  in the sector.
""We have already established a good working relationship and supply agreement with CATL,"" said Julian Blissett, GM s China president. ""We will work very closely with CATL in the future.""
""We are not planning on importing any major components for new energy vehicles. The drive units, batteries, motors, etc, will be made locally in China,"" Blissett told local media on Wednesday, according to the transcript provided by GM.
Co-operation with GM would help cement Ningde-based CATL s dominant position in the Chinese EV battery market, where it competes with smaller players like BYD (SZ:002594) and Guoxuan High-tech (SZ:002074).
The group, which already has supply deals with Tesla and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China is the world s biggest market for new energy vehicles, which include battery electric cars as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
In China GM and its partner SAIC Motor (SS:600104) sell the electric Velite 6 model under the Buick marque as well as Chevrolet s electric Menlo.
Through another venture, SGMW, GM sells electric Wuling minivans and Baojun E-Series mini cars with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group.

""We are heavily committed to China and we have basically not stopped investing even through COVID-19,"" Blissett added."

Investing.com -- Germany’s stock market is selling the fact of the country’s second big stimulus package, having bought the rumor aggressively earlier.
By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the DAX was down 0.7%, but still well above the 12,000 mark that it reclaimed for the first time since March earlier in the week. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.6%, consolidating ahead of the European Central Bank’s meeting.
The package - worth 130 billion euros over the next two years - was as noteworthy for what was missing as for what was actually included: in contrast to the big fiscal packages of 2009, there was almost no direct aid to the auto sector, while the overwhelming bulk of the package went to support lower earners and families, as well as the municipalities whose public services they depend on. 
There was no wholesale scrappage scheme to incentivize purchases of new cars. Such support for the makers of mainly luxury cars at a time of unparalleled economic collapse was too politically toxic. But Berlin did increase the amount of federal subsidies for buying pure electric vehicles, and provided another 2.5 billion to expand the country’s charging network.
This is the legacy specifically of the diesel emissions scandal, where Volkswagen and, to a lesser extent,  Daimler   and BMW for years sold cars whose actual emissions of harmful exhaust fumes far exceeded the makers’ claims, contributing to pollution crisis that had already shortened over half a million European lives by 2016, when the scale of the cheating became clear.
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) stock was down 2.8% by mid-morning in Frankfurt, while BMW  stock was down 1.7% and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock was down 0.9%. VW outperformed because it is arguably in the best position to profit from the new subsidies for electric cars, which will apply only to models with prices up to 40,000 euros ($45,000). One point of note is that the local price of Tesla s  Model 3 is also currently above that ceiling, which will help ensure that the big three’s most potent competitor doesn’t get the lion’s share of the goodies – unless Tesla cuts its prices.
The industry should profit a little from the temporary cut in Value Added Tax to 16% from 19% for the rest of the year, but that, too, is a measure that will serve more to relieve the stress on smaller businesses, allowing them to pad their margins a bit and to work with less working capital."

Buyer incentives for passenger cars, including a lowering of value added tax (VAT) to 16% from 19% were included as part of a 130 billion euro ($145.74 billion) stimulus but analysts said it would not be enough to significantly boost car demand.
""The lowering of VAT will hardly provide an impetus,"" said Peter Fuss, a partner at EY, adding that electric cars are still too much of a niche product to lift the overall market.
Germany included a 6,000 euro incentive for battery electric cars costing below 40,000 euros, bringing consumer incentives for electric cars to 9,000 euros once a 3,000 euro manufacturer stipend is included. [nL8N2DH2E8]
According to Germany s Federal Office for Economy and Export, BAFA, the cars eligible for the full subsidy include the BMW i3, Hyundai s Ioniq and Kona models, Kia s E-Nero, Peugeot  s electric 208,  Renault   s Zoe and Tesla  s Model 3.
VW is readying a mass market push for its ID3 model which will cost below 40,000 euros.
Tesla s Model S and the Mercedes EQC are also eligible for subsidies but not for the full amount.
Electric cars made up only 1.8% of new passenger car registrations last year in Germany.
Germany will overhaul its motor vehicle tax. From January 2021, cars with an emission of more than 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre will face higher levies. 
The average vehicle emissions of a new car last year in Germany was around 150.9 grams of CO2 per kilometre. Due to the popularity of SUVs, average emissions of new cars rose to 154.8 grams per kilometre in May.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co  is developing an electric van aimed at business users, joining a growing list of carmakers planning EVs for the same segment which includes customers such as Amazon.com Inc  and  United Parcel  Service Inc , five people familiar with the plans told Reuters. 
That multibillion-dollar strategy could enable GM, Ford Motor  Co and at least two EV startups to build and deliver more electric vehicles at a time when consumer demand for battery-powered models is still a small fraction of overall industry sales, while targeting a potentially lucrative market segment that Tesla  Inc has yet to address.
GM s plan to develop an electric van has not previously been reported. The No. 1 U.S. automaker did not confirm the van, but has said it plans to introduce at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, in a variety of body styles including sedans, trucks and crossovers. 
Suppliers familiar with such plans at GM and Ford told Reuters the Detroit automakers, which count trucks and commercial vehicles among their most profitable businesses, ""don t want to leave the door open for Tesla"" as they did in consumer passenger cars.
Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, said the package delivery firm believes electric vans have the potential to disrupt the commercial market.
""It s going to be similar to what the Model 3 has done for the consumer market,"" Phillippi said, referring to Tesla s small near-luxury electric sedan. ""Now all of a sudden, we re off to the races.""
The GM van – code-named BV1 – is due to start production in late 2021, the sources said. It is believed the BV1 van will share some components with GM s future electric pickups and SUVs, including the automaker s new Ultium advanced battery system. It is expected to be assembled alongside the electric trucks at GM s Detroit-Hamtramck plant.
GM is considering whether to offer the electric van through its traditional truck brands - Chevrolet and GMC - or market it under a different brand such as Maven, the sources said. GM s first electric pickup truck, due in late 2021, will be sold by GMC dealers under the Hummer brand.
In a statement, GM said it is ""committed to an all-electric future and is implementing a multi-segment, scalable EV strategy to get there. At this time, we do not have any announcements to make regarding electric commercial vehicles.""
The GM electric van project is aimed at an important segment of the emerging EV market – commercial delivery vehicles. For established players, this is a hugely profitable business segment driven by cost of ownership, not fancy tech or star power. It is also a segment in which Tesla and its high-profile CEO, Elon Musk, lack an entry to compete for sales and CO2 credits, which allow automakers to offset the sale of non-electric vehicles including high-margin pickups and SUVs.
""Buyers of commercial vans want reliability and not necessarily a flashy brand name,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""The reduced maintenance and fuel use of electric vehicles become very attractive to a business customer, where the current limitations of EVs make the price premium less attractive to individual consumers.""
In February, Ford said it would introduce an electric version of its Transit van for model year 2022. ""The most critical bet we will be making over the next several years will be our commercial vehicles,"" Ford s chief operating officer, Jim Farley, told Reuters at the time.
Ford also is an investor in Michigan-based startup Rivian, which is scheduled to begin building the first of 100,000 mid-size electric vans for Amazon next year.
Amazon rival UPS has commissioned 10,000 mid-size electric vans from British startup Arrival, which is backed by Korea s Hyundai Motor Co and its sister company Kia Motors Corp.
The combined value of the Amazon and UPS contracts with Rivian and Arrival is estimated at $4 billion or more.
And more players in the segments will likely follow, including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, said Samit Ghosh, chief executive of the Americas for consulting and engineering firm umlaut.

""The delivery vans is a volume not to be underestimated,"" he said. ""I would not just call it a niche segment."""

""This is insane @JeffBezos,"" Musk tweeted at Amazon s chief. Both men are billionaires and oversee competing space exploration companies on top of their duties at Telsa and Amazon. ""Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!"" Musk added in a second tweet.
Musk does not have legal authority to break up Amazon.
The retailer had no comment on Musk s call for its dissolution but said the book in question, by author Alex Berenson, had been blocked in error and was now available for sale via its Kindle e-reading service. The decision to greenlight the book s sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said.
The Tesla  chief, who earlier this month said he would take a break from Twitter, has a history of being outspoken on the social media platform. A tweet in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private led to a lawsuit against Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the parties later settled. Musk has lashed out about shelter-at-home restrictions to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus as well.
According to a photo of a message Amazon sent Berenson, posted on Twitter, the retailer had taken action because the 22-page book did not comply with guidelines that Amazon did not specify, adding, ""we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus."" Berenson s book is titled, ""Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates.""

Berenson did not respond to an email requesting comment. After Amazon approved the book s sale, he tweeted, ""thanks to @elonmusk and everyone who helped."""

Investing.com -- The U.S. will release its official labor market report for May, and there is a clear risk of an upside surprise after ADP’s better-than-expected numbers on Wednesday (even if that was neutered, in turn, by yesterday’s jobless claims figures). Brent oil futures are back above $41 after reports of a breakthrough in talks with overproducers. The ECB’s latest booster shot of stimulus is driving bond spreads down and stocks up, while underwhelming reports from Broadcom  and Slack may weigh on tech stocks. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, June 5th.
1. It s payrolls day.
The third of this week’s updates from the U.S. labor market arrives at 8:30 AM ET with the publication of the Labor Department’s monthly report. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have fallen by 8 million in the month to mid-May, a gentler drop than the 20.5 million seen in April but still a number that points to immeasurable hardship across the country. The jobless rate is expected to rise to a postwar high of 19.7%.
The risk is for an upside surprise – ADP’s assessment of private payrolls on Wednesday suggested a much gentler decline of barely 2 million. However, the  latest instalment of weekly jobless claims numbers on Thursday was a reminder that the trend is turning more slowly than politicians – and stock markets – would like to believe.
2. Euro, Stoxx hit three-month highs after ECB action
European assets are enjoying their moment in the sun, after the European Central Bank padded its emergency bond-buying fund by another 600 billion euros ($680 billion) at its meeting on Thursday.
The euro earlier hit $1.1384, its highest level against the dollar since March 10, but is consolidating now after rallying for 10 days straight since the European Commission announced its own 750 billion program aimed at helping the EU economy recover next year.
Sovereign yield spreads have tightened to their narrowest since March in the wake of the dual initiative by Brussels and Frankfurt, something that is allowing chronically beaten-down bank stocks to lead the current rally.
Earlier Thursday, the German Bundesbank said the stimulus package announced by Berlin on Wednesday would soften the economy’s contraction this year by over 1% of GDP. It still expects a decline of over 7% for 2020, while the ECB sees the euro zone shrinking by 8.7%.
3. OPEC-Russia agrees in principle on deal extension
Crude oil prices jumped again as the so-called OPEC+ group of producers agreed in principle to extend the current level of output restraint by one month, that is, until the end of July.
The group will meet virtually on Saturday to rubber-stamp the agreement, which came after Iraq and Nigeria agreed to improve their compliance with the deal agreed in April at the depths of the collapse in global demand.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 2.2% at $38.24 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was up 3.0% at $41.20 a barrel, the first time it’s been above $41 since March 7.
4. Stocks set to open higher on oil news
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, having turned positive on the back of the news coming out of OPEC. That would cap a remarkably resilient week for stocks, which are now close to recovering pre-pandemic levels as stimulus money continues to find its way into financial assets.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 283 points or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.3%.
The dollar index, by contrast, appeared to be bottoming out around 96.8 after losing 1.8% over the course of the week, while gold futures were down 1.1% at $1,708.30 a troy ounce.
5. Slack, Broadcom put a question mark over tech valuations
A note of caution could be seen in tech stocks this morning after two disappointing updates from prominent names after the bell on Thursday.
Chipmaker Broadcom warned that it expected the next couple of quarters to be overshadowed by supply chain constraints and a “substantial reset in wireless”, also hinting that it expects the launch of the next generation of iPhones (for which it makes chips) to be delayed.
Separately, messaging service Slack said it had failed to register any acceleration in revenue growth in the last three months, despite perceptions that it was well positioned to profit from the boom in remote working.  Slack’s figures stood in sharp contrast to those released by Zoom Video earlier in the week."

Overall passenger car sales in May rose 1.9% from a year earlier to 1.61 million, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said on Monday. 
The association said during an online briefing that the retail sales growth beat expections and signalled a recovery in the passenger car market. However, it forecasts sales in June will fall, citing last year s strong figure.
Tesla Inc  sold 11,065 Shanghai-made Model 3 electric sedans in May, up 205% compared to April.
An executive at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), owned by India s Tata Motors , said the firm expects sales of China s luxury car segment this year to be level with last year or see slight growth.

Investing.com -- ECB head Christine Lagarde will face a grilling about the latest largess from the central bank, while Wall Street is set to open higher, continuing the recent positive trend. Crude oil posted more gains as major producers agreed to limit output for another month, while speculation has emerged about a huge meger in the healthcare sector. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, June 8th.
1. ECB head Lagarde faces questions
All eyes will be on European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde later Monday as she testifies, via satellite link, before the European Parliament Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
Lawmakers will have the opportunity to ask questions about the reasons behind the ECB’s larger-than-expected increase in its emergency bond buying stimulus program. Investors will be looking for clues on whether the ECB plans to ease monetary policy even further.
The ECB padded its emergency bond-buying fund by another 600 billion euros ($680 billion) at its meeting last Thursday, and it’s easy to see why given the depth of the region’s slowdown illustrated by the almost 18% slump in Germany’s industrial production data in April.
However, she could face some tricky questions over this additional stimulus after the German top court ruling that the European Central Bank abused its power in earlier bond purchases.
2. Talk of mega-healthcare merger
AstraZeneca , the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, approached U.S. rival Gilead Sciences  about a potential tie-up last month, according to a report by Bloomberg over the weekend.
Such a deal would result in the biggest healthcare merger to date, creating a partnership worth around 200 billion pounds ($250 billion).
The two companies are among a host of firms racing to develop a vaccine for Covid-19, while Gilead’s antiviral drug Remdesivir is seen as a leading treatment for patients suffering from the effects of the virus.
Both companies have declined to comment on the report, but doubts exist as to the likelihood of this tie-up now as AstraZeneca’s valuation could soar given its collaboration with researchers at Oxford University put it at the forefront of the search for a vaccine.
3. OPEC+ agrees extension to record production cuts
Crude oil prices pushed higher Monday after a group of major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July.
Sentiment in the oil market has changed sharply since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia - collectively known as OPEC+ - agreed in April to cut supply by 9.7 million barrels per day during May-June to prop up prices that collapsed due to the coronavirus crisis.
On Saturday, the group agreed to extend the deal by a third month to the end of July. 
The extension had been delayed by the worries of some of the bigger producers, namely Saudi Arabia and Russia, that other countries were playing fast and loose with compliance.
Iraq and Nigeria exceeded production quotas in May and June, but they have agreed to slightly deeper cuts to compensate for their failure to the original agreement.
Investor sentiment also got a boost from Sunday’s Chinese customs data which indicated that the country’s crude imports soared to 11.34 barrels a day, 15% more than April, a positive indication of China’s recovery from the Covid-19 virus.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.8% at $39.68 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was up 1.2% at $42.82 a barrel.
4. Stocks set to open higher, continuing recent gains 
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, continuing to push higher as optimism grows about the rebounding of the economy from the shutdown needed to combat the Covid-19  virus.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 141 points or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 cash indices are now trading at 3.5 month highs, having posted gains for three straight weeks, while the NASDAQ Composite posted an all-time intraday high on Friday.
Friday’s shock gain in payrolls has boosted hope of a V-shaped economic recovery. Adding to the positive news is that New York City, seen as the epicenter of the virus outbreak in the U.S., is to begin its phase one reopening  Monday.
This all puts the spotlight on the U.S. Federal Reserve s monetary policy announcement on Wednesday. 
5. Musk doubles down on SpaceX
Elon Musk is in the spotlight again. 
Fresh from his SpaceX company launching astronauts for the first time just a few days ago, Musk has urged his SpaceX employees to accelerate progress on its next-generation Starship rocket “dramatically and immediately,” in a company-wide email seen by CNBC.
Musk’s goal is to make Starship fully reusable, becoming more like a commercial airplane with short turnaround times between flights, making it more commercially viable.
This is all very exciting, but is there a danger Musk loses focus regarding his Tesla  electric car company?"

Investing.com - Wall Street climbed on Monday as investor optimism over an economic recovery continued amid signs of ongoing progress to reopen the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.19%, or 322 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.82%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.81% to hit an intraday record high.
New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, began to reopen on Monday, boosting hopes of a quicker economic recovery just as data showed the U.S. officially entered a recession in February, marking an end to its longest expansion on record.
""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" The National Bureau of Economic Research said. 
Optimism on the economy has continued to galvanize cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. 
Energy led the broader move higher, shrugging off a fall in oil prices after Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait said they would end voluntary output cuts.
The announcement arrived as OPEC and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, agreed on Saturday to extend production cuts (set in April) through July.
Tech, however, proved an exception to the rally as the pace of the reopening appears to have dented demand for stay-at-home stocks, with Netflix , and Peloton Interactive  under pressure.
Elsewhere, Tesla  jumped 6% on data showing demand for its Model 3 in China returned in May, triggering bullish commentary on Wall Street.

The trade war amplified calls in the U.S. and elsewhere for reducing dependence on China for strategic goods. Now, the pandemic has politicians vowing to take action.
The Trump administration has talked about bringing supply chains home from China, and even publicly floated the need for a group of friendly nations in Asia that could help produce essential goods. President Donald Trump last month even said the U.S. would “save $500 billion” if it cut off ties with China.
But interviews with nearly a dozen government officials and analysts in the Asia-Pacific region show that any broader effort to restructure supply chains is little more than wishful thinking so far. While governments are pushing to win investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s planned state-of-the-art semiconductor factory in the U.S., it won’t be simple to dismantle an entrenched system when many companies are struggling to survive.
More likely is that the virus will accelerate a change that was already driven by market forces as rising wages and costs in China over the past decade caused an exodus of lower-value manufacturing, much of it to Southeast Asia. That’s despite the desire from some in the Trump administration to start decoupling the world’s biggest economies as the U.S. and China spar over everything from the virus to 5G networks to Hong Kong.
“The rhetoric meets the reality, which is that many firms have supply chains set up the way they do for very sensible reasons,” said Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre, which has seen an increase of companies looking for advice on reorganizing to increase competitiveness. “Coming out of Covid, it’s going to be even harder to move supply chains because your cash flow is low, your staff are working from home or coming slowly back into the office, and the business climate has shifted.”
While the world trade network mostly held up well amid rolling lockdowns as Covid-19 spread, the economic cost fueled calls among politicians for greater self-sufficiency and alternatives to China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose department announced an Economic Security Strategy last year, in April named Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India, and South Korea as countries that the U.S. has been talking to on supply chains.
A key plank of the State Department’s new Economic Security Strategy is expanding and diversifying supply chains that protect “people in the free world,” according to Keith Krach, a State Department official who leads efforts to develop international policies related to economic growth.
Krach said in April a so-called “Economic Prosperity Network” of like-minded allies would be built for critical products.
Industries would include pharmaceuticals, medical devices, semiconductors, automotive, aerospace, textiles and chemicals, among others.
But the idea right now appears to lack any firm foundation. The State Department doesn’t have jurisdiction over trade, and officials in other Asian countries said no formal talks were taking place. A person close to the administration said Krach is prone to pushing grand ideas publicly that haven’t yet become policy.
Still, other governments are moving on their own to shift production away from China -- especially since the Covid disruptions. This includes Taiwan and Japan, which were among the biggest investors in China’s manufacturing capacity in the early days.
“Many companies have already begun adopting a ‘China plus one’ manufacturing hub strategy since the U.S.-China trade war began in 2018, with Vietnam having been a clear beneficiary,” said Anwita Basu, head of Asia country risk research at Fitch Solutions. While the pandemic will give that another push, “shifts away from China will be slow as that country still boasts an annual manufacturing output that is so large that even a group of countries would struggle to absorb a fraction of it.”
In 2019, Taiwanese officials encouraged the island’s firms to build a “non-red supply chain” outside of China, passing a law that promised rent assistance, cheap finance, tax breaks and simplified administration for investments in Taiwan. The move helped the island’s economy weather the trade war last year and led to more than NT$1 trillion ($33.5 billion) pledged or invested domestically, and more overseas.
Japan recently started down the same path, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government budgeting about 220 billion yen ($2 billion) for companies shifting production back home and 23.5 billion yen for those seeking to move production to other countries.
“Everyone agrees we really have to reconsider the sustainability of supply chains,” Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of Hitachi  Ltd. and head of Japan’s biggest business lobby Keidanren, said on television last month. “It’s unrealistic to suddenly return all production to Japan. But if we are totally reliant on one specific country and they have a lockdown, there will be huge consequences.”
For all that, China retains some key advantages. Last year 38% of Taiwan’s $11 billion of overseas investment still went to the mainland, as did 10% of Japan’s -- despite increased investments in Southeast Asia over the past few decades due to periodic bouts of anti-Japanese rioting in China.
Young Liu, chairman of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry, whose Foxconn unit manufactures iPhone in plants in China, said in mid-May that it’s difficult to move assembly of mobile devices to the U.S due to the sheer number of workers needed.
“China remains unmatched as a manufacturing site given its numbers of skilled workers, deep supplier networks and the government’s credible public support for manufacturers and provision of reliable infrastructure,” wrote Gavekal analyst Dan Wang in a report in April.
Even if companies find economic alternatives to Chinese factories, or bow to political pressure to increase production in their home markets, there’s another reason why production inside China continues to make sense: the vast and growing Chinese domestic market.
Tesla  Inc. is now producing cars there for what is now the world’s largest auto market, and last month Chinese Premier Li Keqiang sent Honeywell International Inc . a letter welcoming its new investment in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak started. He and other Chinese officials have touted continued economic cooperation with the U.S. and vowed to implement a “phase one” trade deal with the U.S. reached in January.
‘Unrealistic and Insensible’
“The formation and development of global industrial and supply chains are determined by market forces and companies’ choices,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March. “As such, it is unrealistic and insensible to try to sever them or even trumpet ‘shifting’ or ‘decoupling’ theories as they run counter to economic law.”
For all the talk of dependence on China, the pandemic showed that other nations could quickly adapt to meet the need for critical supplies when China’s lockdown halted deliveries of protective clothing, ventilators and medical supplies. Vietnam rapidly ramped up production of face masks, exporting more than 415 million in four months, while the U.S. pushed automakers and other manufacturers to retool plants to make respirators and other critical supplies.
Over the long term, however, there are questions of whether those models are sustainable -- and who will pay for new plants outside China.
A May 14 executive order from Trump allows the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., America’s development bank for emerging markets, to partner with the Department of Defense in the U.S. to lend money to American companies looking to build out supply chains for critical goods such as ventilators and generic drugs.
Trillions of Dollars
But with governments already having to fund trillions of dollars in bailout packages for existing businesses and companies going bust in droves, finding the extra capital to restructure global supply chains is a tall order. Andrew Hastie, an Australian lawmaker and chair of the nation’s security and intelligence committee, called in a recent essay for “time limited tax incentives” to build national self-reliance in key pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other critical goods.
In the end, the biggest force diluting China’s position in the global supply chain will likely be the long, slow evolution of global trade, as companies see opportunities that arise from new markets, new technologies and changing patterns of wealth. Why would a firm “say to their staff and their shareholders we have opted for political reasons to change the way that we do things,” said Elms, whose organization helps governments formulate trade policy.
“The numbers have to make sense,” she said. “The structure that you have is based on millions of individual company decisions. It’s not so easy to wave a wand and say: Make it so!”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Passenger-packed pods speeding through vacuum tubes linking Amsterdam s Schiphol airport to European cities could prove a viable low-carbon alternative to short-haul flights, according to a study published on Wednesday.
Although hyperloop technology, which uses magnetic levitation to allow near-silent travel at airline speeds, has not yet proven feasible in large-scale operations, the airport said it was seriously exploring it as a potential form of sustainable transport.
""We are genuinely interested in where hyperloop could go,"" said Hassan Charaf, head of innovation at Royal Schiphol Group, which owns and operates the airport, one of Europe s busiest.
The airport conducted the study in partnership with Dutch company Hardt Hyperloop and it assessed how the system could potentially ease air travel congestion in the coming decades. 
Although hurdles remain to realising the company s vision of a Europe-wide hyperloop network powered by renewable energy, the founders hope climate commitments in the European Union s Green Deal will spur greater investment. 
""Hyperloop really has the potential to be the sustainable alternative to aviation,"" Tim Houter, Hardt s chief executive and a co-founder, told Reuters.
Hardt said it has also signed an agreement with a major European railway manager, which it declined to name, to jointly explore potential routes. 
Founded in early 2017, and backed by investors including the Dutch national railway and Koolen Industries, a Dutch clean energy conglomerate, Hardt Hyperloop says it has since established Europe s first full-scale hyperloop test facility. 

Popularized by Tesla  founder Elon Musk, hyperloop technology is also drawing growing interest in parts of China, the United States and the United Arab Emirates."

Investing.com - Shares of Tesla  crossed the $1,000 mark Wednesday as the stock continued to push into record territory.
Tesla was at $996.50 in morning trading after hitting an intraday high of $1,004.82.
The stock is up nearly 140% year to date.
CEO Elon Musk said today that it is time to bring its Semi commercial truck to “volume production”, as the U.S. electric vehicle maker ramps up vehicle production after a brief virus-related shutdown.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc s  stock jumped above $1,000 a share on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk told his staff it was time to bring the Tesla Semi commercial truck to ""volume production."" 
Musk, in an email seen by Reuters on Wednesday, did not specify a time frame for ramping up production of the Semi. Musk on Wednesday tweeted ""Yes"" to a question on Twitter about whether the report of the leaked Semi truck production email was accurate. 
Tesla s shares rose about 6% to hit $1,000 on Wednesday after Reuters reported Musk s email, making the Silicon Valley company the second-most valuable automaker in the world, behind Japan s Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). Tesla s share surge could position Musk for another payout from a stock compensation plan tied to the company s market capitalization.
The stock also got a boost from a bullish call by Wedbush, which lifted its target price for the automaker to $1,000 and said Tesla could have ""more room to run."" 
Investors also are anticipating Musk will unveil new ""million-mile"" battery technology that could deliver longer life, lower costs and better range for future Tesla vehicles.
""Production of the battery and powertrain will take place at Giga Nevada,"" Musk wrote. Most of the other work will probably take place in other states, he wrote, without stating where.
Musk has said Tesla is scouting other U.S. states for a site to build a new factory, hinting that Texas could be a candidate. Oklahoma and other states are campaigning for the investment.
When Musk unveiled the prototype of the futuristic, battery-powered Semi in 2017, he said the Class 8 truck would go into production by 2019. More recently, he said the Semi would go into volume production by 2021.
Musk s Tuesday message coincides with a surge in the share price of rival clean truck maker  Nikola Corp  . 
Nikola, an electric and fuel cell truck startup, earlier this month began trading on the NASDAQ after it merged with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ. 
Shares in Nikola have more than doubled in price over the past week as the company s CEO has used Twitter and interviews to promote plans to launch an electric pickup truck to Tesla s forthcoming Cybertruck.
Nikola and CNH Industrial  s IVECO commercial truck operation last year formed a joint venture to build a battery electric and fuel cell truck line called the Nikola Tre. IVECO has said orders are strong for the electric version of the truck, due out next year.

Nikola on Wednesday said it had hired a former Tesla executive, Mark Duchesne, to lead its manufacturing and a former  Caterpillar   executive, Pablo Koziner, to head its hydrogen fueling and battery recharging business."

""There are three (automakers) in the running right now for a joint venture on Badger, and we will announce who that is in the next few months,"" Milton, who is also the company s executive chairman, told Reuters.
The production of Badger, which will compete with electric car maker Tesla Inc s  Cybertruck, is set to start in 2022 or earlier, Milton said. The pickup truck will be available in both electric and fuel-cell versions.
Nikola claims Badger has a range of 600 miles, compared with Cybertruck s range of more than 500 miles.
Milton also said deliveries of its electric commercial trucks, built in partnership with CNH Industrial , an Italian-American maker of Iveco trucks, would start in the second half of 2021.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto parts suppliers across North America said they are encouraged as major automakers accelerate production after coronavirus pandemic shutdowns, but are holding back on hiring and investment because of longer-term uncertainty.
U.S. automakers reopened most assembly plants in late May after states began loosening restrictions, and stronger-than-expected retail auto sales in May have automakers ramping up production of the highly profitable trucks and SUVs consumers are buying. [nL1N2DF0VG] 
However, several auto suppliers interviewed by Reuters worry about demand heading into 2021. U.S. and global auto sales are not expected to recover to pre-COVID-19 crisis levels until 2022 or 2023, Bank of America  analyst John Murphy said during a presentation on Thursday.
Andreas Weller, CEO of aluminum parts maker Aludyne, sees very strong orders for July, but he laid off more than 10% of his workers because the days of Americans buying 17 million new vehicles a year will not return any time soon. 
""What s the market going to look like for the rest of the year, going into next year? That s a bigger unknown,"" he said.
 Magna International Inc   CEO Don Walker said orders from automakers were good and the ""big unknown"" was how consumers respond.
""I ll be surprised if anybody moves to shut part of the auto industry production down again,"" he said at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference on Thursday. 
HIRING FREEZES 
Other concerns include the potential for smaller parts makers to fail and bring production to a halt, and the possibility of another COVID-19 outbreak in the fall.
""We don t know what the world is going to be,"" said Joe Perkins, chief executive of engineering and machining firm Busche Performance Group, which counts General Motors Co  and  Ford Motor Co   among its customers. ""I m very hesitant to predict where the market goes through the balance of 2020 and 2021.""
Most of the 11 supplier executives contacted by Reuters said they are closely watching spending, in some cases laying off or slowly recalling furloughed workers, implementing hiring freezes and delaying capital spending.
In the short term, suppliers said they welcome the accelerating pace of production as automakers try to restock depleted showrooms. Ford said on Wednesday it expected its U.S. assembly plants to regain pre-COVID-19 operating levels by early July. [nL1N2DN0W7]
""They re basically ramping up to full production ... quicker than we thought,"" said John Dunn, Americas CEO for Clean Energy Systems, a  Plastic Omnium   unit that makes fuel and emissions-reduction systems.
The happiest suppliers are those building pickup trucks and SUVs as demand continues to shift from sedans, said Pierre Labat, vice president of global auto for aluminum provider Novelis Inc, which is owned by India s  Hindalco Industries  Ltd .
Some product-development plans have been delayed by the outbreak, or canceled in some cases like the electric vehicle Ford s Lincoln brand was going to build with Rivian. Bob Roth, co-owner of RoMan Manufacturing, which builds tooling and equipment, lost that job.
""I would be hard-pressed to place my bet at the moment, which puts me in the cautious camp,"" Roth said. ""We ve just got to get through the next six-to-18 months.""
The pressure on automakers to reduce CO2 emissions through electrification is a bright spot for some suppliers.

""Automakers realize this isn t a game of poker,"" said Andrew Storm, CEO of Eckhart Inc, which builds robots and automated tools for GM, Tesla Inc  and others. ""Either they commit the capital or the disruptive forces of innovation obliterate their long-term existence into the bin of history."""

Investing.com -- Wall Street is set to bounce back from Thursday’s sharp selloff, while oil has stabilised. There’s an abundance of data due later Friday that could put this tone to the test. The U.K. suffered a record drop in output in April, in the height of its lockdown, while Tesla’s stock is losing some investment banking friends after its meteoric rise. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, June 12th.
1. Stocks set to rebound strongly after reality check
U.S. stock markets are set to surge Friday, rebounding after Thursday’s sharp selloff which has acted as a reality check given the strong gains on Wall Street over the last couple of months.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 587 points or 2.3%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 1.6% higher.
Wall Street tumbled in a broad sell-off on Thursday, with the Dow suffering its biggest one-day decline since the middle of March, as a jump in new Covid-19 infections threatened to slow down the pace of the reopenings prompting investors to ditch stocks and flee to safety.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.9%, or 1,861 points. The S&P 500 fell 5.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 5.3%. 
The indices are on track to end a spell of three winning weeks, with the DJIA down 7% so far, the S&P 500 down 6% and the Nasdaq Composite 3% lower.
“Equities had been trading in large part due to three factors: a V-shaped recovery of the real economy and earnings, optimism on the medical and public health front, and the likelihood of additional support from both the Fed and the fiscal authorities,” said John Velis, FX and Macro Strategist, Americas, BNY Mellon  in a note to clients.
2. U.K. suffers record output drop
Britain s economy suffered a record collapse in April, shrinking by 20.4% in April from March as the country spent the month in a tight coronavirus lockdown.
""Record GDP falls in today’s figures. When taking April and March together the economy is 25% smaller. The economy in April the same size as it was in 2002,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said on Twitter.
""Virtually all areas of the economy were hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all giving the biggest contributions to this historic fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics.
These figures are particularly weak when compared with the U.K.’s main European rivals. 
The Bank of France estimated Thursday that the French economy would show a 15% quarterly contraction in the April-June period, while German industrial output dropped by 17.9% in April from March.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development did warn on Wednesday that Britain was on course for the worst downturn among all the major economic powers, forecasting its economy would contract 11.5% this year.
3. Heavy economic data slate
There are a number of economic indicators due for release Friday, with the Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey, due at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT), the main release.
Expectations are for a number of 75 for June, up from 72.5 the prior month, with sentiment likely on the rise as businesses are reopening and individual restrictions are being loosened in much of the country.
That said, the number of cases of the virus continues to rise in a number of the more populous states, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was downbeat in his assessment of the economic outlook earlier this week.
Before this, May s import price index, which measures the change in the price of imported goods and services purchased in the U.S., is expected to come in at 0.6% compared with a contraction of 2.6% for the prior month. 
May s export price index is also due and is expected to be a gain of 0.6% compared to a contraction of 3.3% the prior month. The figure tracks changes in U.S. exports to determine whether there was an increase in goods sold abroad or merely an increase in the price of exported goods. 
Both indices are due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). 
4. Crude prices set for weekly drop
Crude oil prices were mixed Friday after Thursday’s sharp losses amid fears a surge in new coronavirus infections in many U.S. states could hinder a fragile recovery in demand at the world’s largest consumer, while swelling stockpiles raised fresh concerns about excess supply.
However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another jump in coronavirus cases, helping the tone Friday.
“In our view, the bar for turning to lockdowns again seems very high,” said Danske Bank, in a note to clients. “Not least in the U.S., where there is strong opposition to this.”
Additionally, “the oil market has been overdue a pullback, with prices getting somewhat ahead of actual fundamentals,” said Warren Patterson head of commodities strategy at ING Bank NV in Singapore. “While the market is moving from a surplus to deficit environment, inventories remain at elevated levels and refinery margins are still very weak.”
Oil is heading for the first weekly loss since late April, also weighed by an increase in American crude stockpiles to a record high which raised fresh concerns about a potential supply glut.
Attention will turn Friday to the weekly release of the Baker Hughes rig count, an important business barometer for the oil drilling industry. 
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.2% at $36.26 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was 0.2% higher at $38.61 a barrel.
5. Time to ditch Tesla  stock?
Tesla stock has been one of the most desired on Wall Street over the last year or so, climbing around 145% this year, making the California-based electric-vehicle maker the top performer on the Nasdaq.
The stock climbed above $1,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday, resulting in a market capitalization of $120 billion, nearing that of Toyota, the biggest automaker in the world.
However, this may be the time for investors to think carefully about owning the stock, at least that what a couple of investment banking giants think.
 Morgan Stanley   downgraded Tesla to underweight earlier Friday, saying its elevated price doesn’t properly reflect emerging risks, citing price cuts in China and the U.S..
Goldman Sachs  also cut its investment stance on the car maker Friday to neutral on a 12-month basis, citing a lofty valuation. However, it remained positive on the stock over the longer term."

The brokerages, while reiterating that their long-term view on the stock remains positive, noted the current valuation underestimates risks including increased competition in the electric vehicle industry.
Top automakers including General Motors Co  and  Ford Motor Co   have doubled down on their investments in the space by offering more electric vehicles, aiming to cash in on a sector that is touted as the most promising alternative to conventional cars.
""We highlight risks to Sino-U.S. trade, near-term demand, capital needs and tech competition as the key bear vectors we think deserve more attention,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note on Friday.
Morgan Stanley cut its rating to ""under-weight"", joining 12 other brokerages who recommend selling the stock.
Following Goldman Sachs  downgrade to ""neutral"", Tesla now has 12 analysts with a ""hold"" rating, and nine brokerages recommending ""buy"" or higher.
The bar for the automaker s fundamentals is higher, Goldman analyst Mark Delaney said on Thursday, while increasing the price target to $950 from $925.
Morgan Stanley cut its price target on Tesla s stock to $650 from $680, in line with the median price target, according to Refinitiv data.

Tesla s shares, which have jumped a whopping 360% in the last twelve months, were down nearly 1% in premarket trading."

To McBride, who used to manage law firm Bracewell LLP’s malpractice exposure, Musk’s decision to insure Tesla’s directors out of his own pocket was a first—and a risky move.
But it was also the latest sign that companies are hunting for creative workarounds as rates for directors-and-officers insurance skyrocket amid a surge in lawsuits by plaintiffs seeking to sue as a group. That litigation is now driven by a rash of claims that companies bungled the response to the coronavirus outbreak and the economic lockdown that followed. Prices for D&O coverage are up by almost half and, by one reckoning, are headed for a triple-digit increase.
The galloping rates are “clearly related to litigation over the Covid-19 outbreak and a several-year increase in the number of securities cases against directors and boards,” said McBride, who is now of counsel at the Lanier Law Firm and sits on five boards himself.
“I’m not about to serve on a board where I have to rely on a single individual’s wealth to guarantee I have directors-and-officers coverage,” he added. “There’s just too many unexpected things that can happen.” 
Tesla didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on Musk’s D&O arrangement.

Tesla’s board may be expensive to insure, given Musk’s Twitter missteps and run-ins with regulators, and his new insurance setup creates the potential for conflicts of interest. But the burgeoning litigation and higher rates are widespread, and companies are pressing insurance brokers for solutions.
More corporations are inquiring about covering risks to the board by using a “captive insurer,” an entity funded solely by the company and dedicated to indemnifying it against risk, according to Sarah Downey, a D&O specialist at Marsh & McLennan Cos.’ insurance brokerage. She declined to cite examples.
Since February, investors have sued more than a dozen boards of companies ranging from cruise lines to drug makers chasing a coronavirus vaccine, alleging they were asleep at the switch as the crisis decimated their businesses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
“I think the run to the courthouse has really only just started,” Downey said.
Investors in Norwegian Cruise Line  Holdings Ltd. sued company directors in March over alleged efforts to downplay the risk the virus posed to customers. Bookers were instructed to tell callers the pathogen “can only survive in cold temperatures,” according to court filings. Norwegian now faces other securities cases targeting directors over its handling of the virus. Its stock is down 65% for the year.
Norwegian didn’t return a call and emails seeking comment.
Plaintiffs filed 428 new securities cases seeking class action status in federal and state courts last year, the most on record and nearly double the average from 1997 to 2018, according to a Cornerstone Research report. Evan Greenberg, chief executive officer of insurance giant Chubb  Ltd., has repeatedly addressed the wave of suits in his annual letter. This year he called “excessive litigation” a “tax on society and business.”
Whether the lawsuits spurred by the pandemic will succeed remains to be seen. A volatile stock market generally translates into more securities class actions, but the breadth of the market’s decline might make it harder to prove it was a company’s response to the virus that caused its travails, Travelers Cos. CEO Alan Schnitzer said in April.

In the meantime, rates on D&O policies in the U.S. rose 44% in the first quarter from a year earlier, with 95% of clients experiencing an increase, according to a report by Marsh. AM Best said last week that the pandemic could push those increases to three digits. 
Covid-19 “will ensure that we will see these kinds of increases for the foreseeable future,” said Ty Childress, an insurance lawyer at Jones Day. 
Tesla officials decided not to renew the D&O coverage “due to disproportionately high premiums quoted by insurance companies,” and Musk personally agreed to “provide coverage equivalent to such a policy for a one-year-period,” according to an April securities filing. Tesla said the board doesn’t expect Musk’s arrangement to threaten the independence of its other members, because the new structure is governed by a binding agreement with Tesla and is intended to replace an ordinary insurance policy.
Not everyone sees it that way. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who has long bet against Tesla shares, said last month the structure creates an “obvious conflict of interest” that hinders the board’s ability to “curtail Musk’s behavior.” 
The setup is “dependent on his financial ability to honor his commitment,” Kevin LaCroix, a liability insurance expert at RT ProExec, wrote in his D&O Diary blog in April. He warned that if the economy takes another dive, the directors’ “need for coverage could arise in a set of circumstances that could itself undermine Musk’s ability to honor his commitment.”
It’s a risky board to sit on. In January, Tesla’s insurer paid out $60 million to settle investor claims that directors allowed Musk to dupe the company into overpaying for solar panel maker Solar City. The accord covered all the directors except Musk; his trial is set for July. Musk faces other litigation over controversial tweets about taking Tesla private and rosy predictions about initial production rates for the Model 3 sedan.

Captive insurers have their uses, said the Lanier Law Firm’s McBride. Johnson & Johnson, for example, set up Middlesex Assurance Co. in 1970 to address a profusion of exposure, according to securities filings. Over the years, Middlesex has helped cover litigation costs tied to liabilities including those from the company’s talc-based baby powder, which has been blamed for causing cancer. J&J took the talc-based version of the powder off the market last month.
Kim Montagnino, a J&J spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether J&J has used Middlesex to self-insure its coverage for the company s directors, who include former  Citigroup  Inc . chairman and CEO Charles Prince and former  Aetna Inc  . chairman and CEO Ronald Williams .
Captive insurance is generally trickier with D&O coverage because of potential conflicts of interest, said Marsh’s Downey. The inquiries she’s received haven’t necessarily translated into action, she said.
Musk may be at the leading edge here, as he is in electric cars and space travel, but don’t expect a “stampede,” said McBride, whose five boards include Blue Bell Creameries. “Directors are always going to want to have another pocket of money they can rely on,” he said, “in case their interests and those of the company diverge.”
And if he were invited to join Tesla’s board? First he’d need to cut his own deal with Musk. 
“I’m crafting that agreement, and you can be sure it will be airtight,” he said. “Mr. Musk would have no out when it came to my coverage.”

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The number of publicly accessible charging points for electric vehicles (EV) jumped 60% in 2019, the biggest increase in three years and outpacing sales of battery-powered cars, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In its annual Global EV Outlook, the IEA said the number of public slow and fast charging spots reached 862,118 globally, with China, the world s largest car market, taking a 60% share.
Fast chargers accounted for 31% of the total. The IEA defines slow charging as providing power of up to 22 kilowatts (kW), taking hours to charge a vehicle battery. Fast chargers, including Tesla s  superchargers, can take minutes.
""China continues to lead in the rollout of publicly accessible chargers, particularly fast chargers, which are suited to its dense urban areas with less opportunity for private charging at home,"" the report said.

(For an interactive version of the graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BVCFMu?eikon=true)
The increase reflects efforts to build critical infrastructure ahead of an expected boom in EV sales, which accounted for just 1% of global car stock last year, according to the IEA.
While most EV charging takes place at home or at work, the rollout of public infrastructure is key to convincing prospective buyers that there is no risk of them getting stranded on an empty battery.
As part of its economic stimulus plan, Germany announced earlier this month that it would provide 500 million euros ($563 million) to support the rollout of private charge points, of which there are 6.5 million worldwide.
""I view this as an organic step in the right direction, but not a revolution with big winners or losers,"" said Thomas Daiber, founder of e-mobility advisory firm Cosmic Cat, of the German plan.
As well as Tesla, charge point providers include Anglo-Dutch group Shell (L:RDSa), France s Engie , Germany s E.ON (DE:EONGn), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and ChargePoint, whose shareholders include  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW  and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn).

Travis County Commissioners Court is scheduled to discuss terms of the deal on Tuesday, the paper reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation. A vote is expected in the coming weeks.
The paper said it was unclear whether negotiations with Travis County show that Tesla has picked the Austin region as the site for the plant, which would build the company s electric pickup truck and Model Y SUV and employ thousands of people, or if the company is also negotiating with officials in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tesla officials could not immediately be reached to comment. The company s chief executive, Elon Musk, has tweeted previously about the possibility of bringing a plant to Texas. Oklahoma also has been mentioned as a possible site.
Travis County officials declined to comment, and a spokesman for the Texas governor s office did not immediately comment. 
Last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he had spoken with Musk about a potential plant.
Abbott s comments came three days after Musk had threatened to move Tesla s headquarters and future operations to Texas or Nevada after officials in California s Alameda County, where Tesla s only U.S. vehicle assembly plant is located, said the plant could not yet reopen because of coronavirus lockdown measures. The plant has since reopened.

Officials with the United Auto Workers union, which represents hourly workers at General Motors Co s  assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, said they believe a Tuesday county meeting will include talks about the possible deal. The union, which has unsuccessfully tried organizing Tesla s Fremont, California, plant, called on Texas officials to obtain assurances from Tesla about any potential jobs."

Investing.com - The Dow staged a strong rebound from lows on Monday, as investors weighed further efforts by the Federal Reserve to support credit markets against a jump in Covid-19 infections across U.S. and other parts of the world that threatens to disrupt the pace of the economic reopening.    
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.62%, or 157 points, after falling more than 300 points at the open. the S&P 500 gained 0.83%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.43%.
Just a month after the Federal Reserve began buying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invested in corporate bonds, the central bank announced on Monday that it would buy, on the secondary market, individual corporate bonds with remaining maturities of five years or less.  
On May 12, the Fed began buying corporate bond ETFs under its the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), to steady corporate debt markets following record outflows on concerns about companies defaulting on their debt.   
The announcement came as investors assessed an uptick in Covid-19 infections that threatened to slow the process of reopening the economy.
Reports of a jump in coronavirus cases across the U.S., China, and parts of Europe raised fears a second wave of the virus could be on the horizon that could potentially lead to fresh lockdowns.
Leaders in New York and Texas threatened to renew lockdowns.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that he would reimpose shutdowns if businesses failed to comply with current restrictions and people didn’t socially distance, according to Bloomberg.
Still, some on Wall Street continue to downplay the prospect of lasting damage on corporate earnings.
""But, the combination of incremental data improvement and extraordinary policy support has been sufficient to assure the forward-looking market that the earnings damage resulting from the virus will ultimately be short-lived,"" Goldman Sachs  said in a note.
Travel and tourism, sectors sensitive to the pace of reopenings, pared some of their losses and helped the broader market bounce from session lows.

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will update Congress on his expectations for the U.S. economy, just as the Fed s latest stimulus action keeps a flagging stock market rally going. U.S. retail sales and industrial production data for May are due, as is the NAHB s house price index. The Bank of Japan has also bolstered its direct lending to companies, and the International Energy Agency says oil demand will bounce back more sharply than it originally thought. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 16th.
1. Powell to testify before Congress
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before the Senate Banking Committee in his semi-annual report to Congress on the state of monetary policy, starting at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Powell is set to unveil the Fed’s first new forecasts for the U.S. economy this year, having passed in March due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
He’ll also likely talk up the effectiveness of the Fed’s stimulus, which will gain another leg from today in the shape of direct purchases of individual corporate bonds. The Fed will buy according to an internally-developed index made up of all the bonds in the $9.6 trillion corporate debt market from companies that qualify. The issuer must have had an investment-grade-rating as of March 22 and the securities must have a remaining maturity of less than five years.
The start of New York Fed’s announcement that such purchases will start this week had been enough to ensure that U.S. stocks closed in positive territory on Monday, even though they had clearly been prefigured in the Fed’s announcement of the program in March.
2. Retail sales, industrial production data due
Powell will be testifying against the backdrop of a fresh data dump from the U.S. economy in May. Retail sales, due at 8:30 AM, are expected to have rebounded by 8% in May after their record 16.4% drop in April, with core retail sales rising by a more modest 5.5%. Core sales have fallen for three months in a row – the first time they have done so in eight years.
The retail sales data will be followed by industrial production and manufacturing output figures at 9:15 AM. Industry has rebounded faster than consumption in China, where the virus hit first, but economists expect only a 2.9% increase in output in May.
The National Association of Home Builders will also release its housing market index for the month at 10 AM. That’s expected to rise to 45 from 37 last month.
3. Stocks set to open higher on central bank support
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, still supported by the Fed’s promise of action to support the credit markets on Monday. There is also chatter of the Trump administration preparing an additional $1 trillion infrastructure spending bill, but given that such stories have popped up repeatedly since before Trump’s election, it’s not clear how much more real the plan is now.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow Jones 30 Futures Contract was up 509 points, or 2.0%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract and the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract were both up 1.4%.
Stocks to watch on Tuesday include Groupon , which reports quarterly earnings, and Tesla , which the Financial Times reported as having agreed a major supply deal for cobalt with mining giant Glencore .
.4. Bank of Japan ups stimulus ahead of other CB meetings
The Bank of Japan increased the size of its direct lending program for corporates to the equivalent of $1 trillion, from an originally announced $700 billion.
The news had little effect on the yen, with traders having priced in such action already. However, it supported risk appetite in overseas markets, bolstering hopes of further central bank action in the course of the week.
In addition to the Fed’s new bond-buying and the BoJ’s action, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are both expected to announce fresh stimulus at their regular policy meetings on Thursday. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank s Fabio Panetta hinted that the ECB may follow the Fed in buying the debt of so-called  Fallen Angels , having so far excluded junk-rated companies from its own corporate debt purchases.
5. IEA sees sharper rebound in oil demand
The International Energy Agency trimmed its forecasts for oil demand destruction this year in its latest monthly report on the global oil market.
The IEA revised up its forecast for average demand by 500,000 barrels a day. It now sees demand falling on average by 8.1 million b/d, rather than the 8.6 million b/d it forecast last month. That’s still the biggest-ever yearly drop since the IEA began compiling its data.
The IEA was also more optimistic about 2021, projecting a 5.7 million b/d increase in demand. That suggests the market will rebalance more quickly than many think, given that supply is likely to be constrained by financial distress in the U.S. shale industry."

Tesla and Panasonic have been reported to be in talks to expand the battery joint venture s capacity.
Panasonic hinted in May that it was working to develop new batteries with Tesla, possibly with higher capacity.
Tesla said the deal, signed last week and effective April 1, 2020, sets the terms for production capacity commitments by Panasonic and purchase volume commitments by Tesla over the first two years of the agreement.
Tesla also amended the general terms and conditions of its partnership with Panasonic, modifying the term to expire 10 years after Panasonic achieves certain manufacturing milestones.
Panasonic is no longer Tesla s exclusive battery supplier, but has been able to turn around the U.S. joint battery business as demand for Tesla s electric cars soar.

Last month, Tesla reported its third consecutive quarterly profit despite the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, taking investors by surprise."

1. Beijing tightens restrictions after new Covid-19 outbreak; Fauci warns it isn t over in the U.S. 
The Chinese capital tightened lockdown restrictions to tackle what authorities called an “extremely severe” outbreak of the Covid-19 virus, illustrating the pitfalls of the world’s return to normality after a destructive first wave of the pandemic.
Beijing closed its schools, universities and entertainment venues and cancelled over 1,000 flights,  and authorities also instated a three-week quarantine rule in the neighboring province of Heilonjiang.  However, they haven’t as yet ordered the closure of factories and shops.
The news comes as the U.S. wrestles with a rise in new infections in states from Florida and Texas to California. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, told the Financial Times that “All you need to do is look at the data, the facts, to see that the pandemic is not over by any means. The numbers speak for themselves.”
Vice-President Mike Pence had downplayed talk of a second wave of infections in the U.S. as “overblown” panic in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday.
2. Chinese and Indian soldiers die in border skirmish; Korean tensions rise
The world’s two most populous nations are at each other’s throats over a border dispute. At least 20 soldiers died in a clash between Chinese and Indian troops in a disputed region of the Himalayas mountain range, according to information from the countries’ armed forces.
The clash came as Indian forces tried to verify that China had honored a pledge to vacate certain disputed parts of their joint border.
Elsewhere in Asia, North Korea threatened to redeploy troops to its demilitarized border with South Korea and resume “all kinds of regular military exercises” in a further escalation of tension after blowing up a building that was supposed to host peace talks between the two countries on Tuesday.
South Korea responded with warnings of its own. Relations between the two have worsened considerably since the collapse of President Donald Trump’s peace overtures to North Korea in 2018.
3. Stocks set to open higher, but travel sector weighs 
U.S. stocks are set to open with modest gains ahead of the second day of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s Congressional testimony.
Powell had again warned of a slow and bumpy recovery on Tuesday, although he acknowledged that the worst may be over for the U.S. economy, on a day when fresh data showed retail sales and industrial production rebounded in May.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 59 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.4%.
Stocks in focus on Wednesday are likely to include Norwegian Cruise Line , which extended the suspension of sailings by some of its biggest brands through September in an announcement after the bell on Tuesday. Southwest Airlines  may also come under pressure after saying it would keep middle seats open on its flights due to Covid-19 concerns, reducing its effective capacity.
4. Tesla s Cali sales plunge; European auto sales recover weakly
Tesla  stock will also be in the spotlight after a report suggesting that its sales in California fell 37% in April and May.  The report, citing data from Dominion Enterprises, underlines the problems in keeping the company’s sales momentum in a key state market going.
The news comes at a time when car sales worldwide are flagging. Data released in Europe on Wednesday showed new car registrations down over 53% on the year in May, although this was an improvement from a decline of over 70% year-on-year through April. The biggest increase came in Italy, where sales had all but ground to a halt in the first full month of its pandemic lockdown.
5. EIA, OPEC to update on oil markets
The U.S. government will release its weekly report on domestic oil supplies at 10:30 AM ET, with analysts’ estimates of a 152,000 barrel decline in crude inventories looking vulnerable to a negative surprise after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise increase in stocks late on Tuesday.
Before that, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will release its monthly report on the state of the oil market and is expected to corroborate the International Energy Agency’s upward revisions to crude demand for this year and next.
The Russian news agency TASS reported meanwhile that parties to the ‘OPEC+’  deal on output restraint were still failing to comply fully with the deal in May, something that could make Russian support for a further extension more problematic."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday on continued confidence in a prompt economic recovery, but gains are likely to be limited given worries about a coronavirus resurgence.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures up 56 points, or 0.6%. The Dow Futures contract rose 174 points, or 0.7%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Tuesday 2% higher, the S&P 500 gained 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.8%. These indices are on three-day win streaks, while the Nasdaq has posted gains for seven of the last eight sessions. 
Retail sales surged 17.7% in May, rebounding from a record slump in April, suggesting that consumer spending is on the mend.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also touted signs of a recovery in his virtual testimony to the Senate, which he continues later Wednesday, although he stressed that the outlook remains uncertain amid a lack of visibility about the trajectory of the Covid-19 virus.
There has been a new wave of infections in Beijing, which has forced the Chinese government to impose stricter measures to curb the outbreak, including cancelling around half of all inbound flights to the capital. Additionally, a number of the more populous U.S. states have reported a surge in daily infections.
This comes as researchers in the U.K. released clinical data showing that steroid, Dexamethasone, had reduced deaths among the sickest Covid-19 patients. 
Economic data due for release Wednesday centers around housing starts, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with analysts expecting a recovery to 1.095 million for the month of May, up from 890,000 for April.
In corporate news, Tesla  will also be in the spotlight after a report suggesting that its sales in California fell 37% in April and May.
Additionally, Norwegian Cruise Line  announced late Tuesday that it was extending the suspension of sailings by some of its biggest brands through September.
Oil prices slipped Wednesday, after the American Petroleum Institute predicted late Tuesday a 3.9 million-barrel build for the week ending June 12.
The Energy Information Administration publishes its weekly crude oil inventories data at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). Crude inventories are seen falling 152,000 barrels after a build of 5.7 million barrels in the previous week. OPEC will also present its monthly update on the world oil market.
Crude Oil WTI Futures prices fell 1.4% to $37.86 a barrel, while Brent Futures dropped 0.9% to $40.61.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,724.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1251, down 0.1%."

514,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/the-electric-car-battery-boom-has-screeched-to-a-halt-for-now-2205167,2020-06-17,"The Electric Car Battery Boom Has Screeched to a Halt, For Now By Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) -- Three decades of advances took lithium-ion batteries from powering handheld  Sony   camcorders to propelling Tesla’s popular electric vehicles. The rapid rise is facing a major test in the Covid-19 pandemic.
Demand for rechargeable batteries will decline for the first time this year, as sales of electric cars—the biggest user—slump with novel coronavirus pummeling the auto industry, according to BloombergNEF forecasts. Battery shipments to carmakers are forecast to fall 14% in 2020, and the effects of the slowdown are seen lingering into next year.
Major producers, including South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd., a supplier to Tesla  Inc. and General Motors Co ., have cut annual sales forecasts. Analysts expect the industry’s planned vast expansion of manufacturing capacity to slow down. Startups burning through cash as they work on potential breakthrough technologies are bracing for a tougher sell to secure funds.
And yet, from Silicon Valley laboratories to China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s top producer, optimism over the lithium-ion battery’s longer-term outlook is undimmed. Batteries, say automakers and utility companies, are still on track to become more powerful, cheaper and ubiquitous, not just in passenger vehicles, but also in additional forms of transport, consumer electronics and large-scale energy storage.
Despite short-term pressures, Zeng Yuqun, chairman of CATL, said there is “great confidence in the long-run.” In less than a decade, his company has grown to lead its industry: CATL’s sales rose 90% in 2019, according to BloombergNEF.
Lithium-ion battery demand has more than doubled since 2015 and remains on track for about a ninefold expansion from last year to the end of the decade. The sector is also forecast to keep lowering costs. Battery prices plunged 87% in the past 10 years, pushing plug-in electric cars to near sticker-price parity with gas guzzlers.
The pandemic might even prove to be an opportunity, with at least some governments, including those of Germany and France, using virus recovery funds to help accelerate a transition from internal combustion engines to battery-powered alternatives. France will offer about 8 billion euros ($9 billion) to its auto sector to bolster support for electric vehicles; Germany’s stimulus package includes about 5.6 billion euros for the sector and will require gas stations to install charging units. “This is a historic plan to confront a historic situation,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on May 26.
There are other sources of optimism. Volkswagen AG  on June 16 announced an additional investment of $200 million in QuantumScape Corp., a battery technology startup founded by former Stanford University researchers, after committing $100 million in 2018. In May, the carmaker became the biggest shareholder of Chinese battery producer Guoxuan High-Tech Co. Ltd.
“The train’s left the station on both renewable power generation and electric vehicles, and no one is going to put that train in reverse,” said Jeff Chamberlain, chief executive officer of Volta Energy Technologies, a Chicago-based fund focused on energy investments. Chamberlain previously led energy storage initiatives at the Argonne National Laboratory ,  the U.S. government facility seen as having been pivotal in the transfer of battery technology from academia to the auto sector.
Battery makers also are quickly making progress on three key fronts: battery life, power and cost. CATL recently announced it will soon begin production on a battery that can operate for 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles), or about 16 years. The capability puts it far ahead of any of the batteries on the market today, which typically are under warranty for about 150,000 miles, Zeng said.
Tesla and GM are each developing batteries that can last a million miles. Neither have yet said exactly when they’ll be ready. GM is “almost kind of there on longer life,” Doug Parks, an executive vice president, said at a May 19  Citigroup  Inc . event. The car maker is “experiencing nearly that in some of our products today,” Parks said.Combustion engine vehicles are currently scrapped in the U.S. after about 200,000 miles, Tesla said in a June 8 report, meaning a longer-life battery pack could dramatically extend a car’s lifespan, particularly useful for taxis or delivery trucks. More important, a million-mile pack could be resold by a consumer to be deployed in a second vehicle, offsetting some of the initial purchase price.
Tesla is planning to provide further details on its battery innovations in the coming weeks at what it’s billing as a “battery day” investor seminar. It had tentatively been scheduled for April but was delayed on account of Covid-19 travel concerns and restrictions.
One critical update investors are expecting: the average cost of batteries used in Tesla’s various models. The carmaker’s numbers typically set the standard for others to catch up to, and the car battery still accounts for about 30% of the total cost of an electric vehicle. Better technology and rapid growth in manufacturing capacity has already sent the price of lithium-ion batteries tumbling, down from more than $1,000 a kilowatt hour to an average of $156/kWh at the end of 2019, according to BNEF.
An industry average battery price of $100/kWh, should be achieved in 2024, BNEF analyst James Frith said at a seminar in May, leading to price parity between electric cars and combustion engine vehicles. Additional savings through 2030 will lower costs further, though they’ll prove harder to achieve and will depend on additional advancements and new technology, according to Frith.
 
Every battery has three key components: two electrodes, cathode and anode, with an electrolyte—usually a liquid—to allow the battery to charge and discharge.A key, pending breakthrough will be the addition of silicon into battery anodes in place of graphite. California’s Sila Nanotechnology Inc., which counts  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) among its investors, says the silicon will help make a single charge last at least 20% longer.
The technology is being applied to consumer devices that are due to hit the market next year, said Sila CEO Gene Berdichevsky. There’s also potential for the technology to make its way into some supercars or luxury vehicles as early as 2023—and mainstream vehicles after that, Berdichevsky said. “There s now more engineering resources at the battery makers that we work with,   he said. “There s more capacity on the production line to try new things.""A more significant advance could be achieved before the end of the decade via the commercialization of solid-state lithium-ion batteries for regular cars. Such a development would enable smaller battery packs, reducing safety risks and dramatically improving energy density, allowing cars to travel much further on a single charge.
Solid-state technology does away with the liquid electrolyte, replacing it with a material such as ceramic, glass or polymer.  Toyota  Motor  Corp., the leader in development of the technology, is on track for commercialization in the first half of this decade, the company said.Colorado-based Solid Power Inc. has started shipping its solid-state batteries to prospective customers in the auto industry for testing. The startup is likely to face a challenges in securing funding, while its products go through the years-long process of verification. The batteries won’t be available for purchase before 2025,  if the company is able to navigate through the current economic downturn.
“I’d be lying if I said raising capital in the near term is not going to be challenging,” said Doug Campbell, Solid Power’s CEO.
Those able to withstand short-term pressures should benefit from a demand wave that’ll make about 31% of the world’s passenger cars—about 500 million—battery-powered by 2040, according to BNEF.
There’s also rapid growth coming from two-wheelers such as motorbikes and scooters, as well as in large-scale energy storage. Above Moses Lake, Washington, last month, the maiden flight of a converted, all-electric Cessna plane pointed to an additional potential source of demand.It’s a long-term outlook that’s offering the battery industry reassurance. With parts of California under shelter-in-place restrictions, the board of Sila Nanotechnology, which includes  General Electric   Co.’s financial crisis-era leader Jeff Immelt, met last month via videoconference to consider how best to handle a pandemic-led downturn.“They said: Keep going, be thoughtful in your investments, but keep investing,’’ Berdichevsky said. “Now is not the time to stop.”"

(Reuters) - Glass Lewis said on Thursday that it urged Tesla Inc  investors to vote against re-electing Chairwoman Robyn Denholm to the company s board, making it the second proxy advisory firm to oppose her appointment.
The recommendation was based on corporate governance concerns due to an insurance arrangement with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk after Tesla s decision to not renew its directors and officers  liability policy due to high premiums quoted by insurers, Glass Lewis said.
Musk had agreed to personally provide coverage to such a policy for a year, Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing in April.
""We are concerned that this D&O arrangement gives the company s independent directors a direct, personal financial dependency upon the CEO they are tasked with overseeing,"" Glass Lewis said.
Since Denholm heads the audit committee that permitted the insurance arrangement, it recommends voting against her, Glass Lewis said. 
The recommendation by Glass Lewis was first reported by Bloomberg News.
Earlier this week, another proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) opposed Denholm s re-election on concerns over her leadership, citing high compensation for directors and a steep rise in share pledging by certain Tesla directors and executives, during her stint.
Denholm, the company s director for nearly six years, has been Tesla s chairwoman since November 2018. She is also a member of the company s audit and compensation committee.
The company s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for July 7. 

Tesla did not respond to Reuters  request for comment."

The system, called Active Drive Assist, will be offered on several Ford models, most notably the Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric crossover vehicle that goes on sale later this year and is targeted at the Tesla Model Y market.
Ford said U.S. buyers can order the Mustang Mach-E this fall with the Active Driver Assist hardware package, which includes extra radar sensors and a driver-facing camera, but the software won t be ready until fall 2021.
Tesla introduced its first semi-automated hands-free driver assist package, called Autopilot, in 2015. GM followed two years later with a similar semi-automated feature called Super Cruise on the Cadillac CT6. 
Tesla has constantly revised and updated Autopilot and now offers the feature across its entire four-model range. GM is expanding Super Cruise to other Cadillac models this fall and will offer an enhanced version to other GM brands over the next three years.

Ford said the Active Drive Assist software can be installed when ready next year through a wireless over-the-air update, similar to how some computer software programs are installed and mobile phone apps are updated. Tesla has offered over-the-air updates since 2012."

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co   next week will show the next generation of its brawny F-150 pickup truck that offers a new sleeper-seat feature and over-the-air software updates in a machine Ford is counting on to help pay off coronavirus-related debts.
The new F-150, part of the best-selling vehicle line in the United States, accounts for $50 billion in annual revenue, and a significant share of Ford s annual profit. While Tesla Inc  and General Motors Co  have moved faster on over-the-air software upgrades and high-speed in-vehicle data networks, the new F-150 will bring such technology squarely into the mainstream. 
The new truck, expected to launch later this year, is a critical plank in Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley s plan to slash $5 billion in warranty costs, speed Ford s push into vehicle connectivity and add to the No. 2 U.S. automaker s already-strong position in the North American commercial vehicle market.
Ford has borrowed more than $20 billion to ride out the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic. Profit from the new F-150 will be key to paying that money back.
Ford is not taking big risks with the exterior look of the new truck given its sales dominance, instead focusing on improving the interior, according to those who have seen it. Ford is scheduled to publicly show for the first time the new F-150 online on June 25.
""It s really about technology and productivity,"" Farley said at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference on June 10.
One prominent feature will be the lay-flat passenger seat like those seen in first-class cabins on some planes, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. ""You can basically live in the truck,"" the person said.
Ford s nicer interior, including a larger display screen, follows a similar move by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV   with its new Ram truck, which received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch display screen. 
""Ram taught everybody a little bit of a lesson,"" said Rhett Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio. ""The old 5-inch screen for your navigation and radio controls is gone. They re all going to be 10-, 12-, 15-inch screens. That was started by Tesla.""
The F-150 s new electrical architecture will allow Ford to provide over-the-air updates to key modules controlling the vehicle, replacing trips to the dealership. 
The new truck s connectivity also will help Ford boost sales to commercial customers, and reduce warranty costs, Farley told investors. 
The F-Series truck has been around since 1948, while the F-150 debuted in 1975. Sales of the current version have remained strong despite its age, and the new model could help Ford hold or even build its position in the segment, said Sandy Munro, chief executive of Michigan-based consulting firm Munro & Associates. 
""If they add the same stuff as what Ram did and if they can add more stuff like Tesla s doing, there ll be a gigantic gap between Ford, and Ram and Chevy,"" he said. 
The key for Ford will be to avoid the kinds of costly production problems that hobbled the launch of the new Explorer SUV last year. Ford acknowledged it erred in trying to launch the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator simultaneously while breaking in a new assembly line at its 95-year-old plant in Chicago.

Farley has been visiting the plants in Dearborn, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri, that will build the new F-150. Despite delays related to the virus, he said the launch is in ""really good shape."""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc  wants to start building a large vehicle assembly plant in the southwestern United States as early as the third quarter of this year, the company told Texas officials in documents made public this week.
But the company is still pitting Texas and Oklahoma against each other in an effort to secure tax breaks, the documents show. The plant would build Tesla s electric pickup truck and Model Y SUV, according to reports.
Tesla told officials in Travis County, Texas, the automaker wants to invest about $1 billion to build a 4 million to 5 million square foot vehicle assembly plant employing 5,000 people on the grounds of what is now a cement operation near Austin. But it needs tax breaks to make the site competitive with an alternative location in Oklahoma, according to documents filed with Texas officials.
The Austin-American Statesman reported details of the company s filings.
Tesla officials could not immediately be reached for comment, but Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk previously hinted about a Texas plant, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott has spoken with Musk about the possibility.
Oklahoma s Secretary of Commerce Sean Kouplen said Tulsa remains in the hunt for the plant.
""We’ve pulled together a compelling, well-balanced and, more importantly, a responsible performance-based incentives package to attract Tesla to Oklahoma,"" he said in a Thursday statement. 
Tesla s sole U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, covers 5.3 million square feet - a large plant, but not large enough for the growing company. Tesla has had to build cars under a tent adjacent to the plant.

Musk clashed with California officials after Alameda county officials ordered the Fremont factory to halt production and comply with coronavirus stay-at-home orders that took effect in March. He threatened to move future operations to Texas or Nevada. The California plant has since reopened."

SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - Main Street investors who have reaped windfall gains from the steepest stock market rebound on record now seem to be making for safety, brokers say, just as Wall Street experts are advising clients to dip their toes into riskier assets again.
Over the past three months, the favourite stocks of ""mom-and-pop"" traders have run up even harder than the broader market s 40% rise.
But many of these novices, who began trading partly as entertainment and partly as plunging prices made stocks more attractive, now appear to be shifting strategy and cashing out of the frothiest sectors, or moving into safer-seeming bets.
Customers at Saxo Markets in Singapore have been reducing long positions at gathering pace this month. Asian investors with TD Ameritrade  are selling soaring tech companies for banks, while other brokers report demand for blue chips.
The moves flip the image of retail investors as ""moths,"" as they are called in Thailand for their reputation of being drawn to bright lights only to get burned, since small traders appear to have led rather than lagged professionals this time.
""Some of the pros on Wall Street might be pulling their hair out, saying that this fundamentally doesn t make sense,"" said Chris Brankin, chief executive at TD Ameritrade in Singapore.
""But I don t think they have anything to compare it with...whereas retail investors kind of go more with the money flow and sentiment of the markets.""
A basket of stocks popular with retail investors, including Tesla ,  Moderna   and  Snap Inc  , surged 61% from Wall Street s March low, compared with a 45% rise in a portfolio favoured by professionals, according to Goldman Sachs . 
FORGET NUMBERS
Like other banks, Goldman analysts recommend clients avoid the energy sector, prefer utilities to financials and expect techs  hot run to continue. But Asian broker analysis suggests retail buyers are going their own way.
""Sometimes I think reports out of fancy brokerages are bullshit,"" said Lee Sang-hoon, a 37-year-old office worker in South Korea.
He has made a 44% return on his initial 140 million won ($115,740) investments since March, trading U.S. stocks in the Seoul night and relying on Google  Trends data to track investor mood.
""When Google says there s going to be more buyers, I buy. Forget numbers, if the sentiment is strong, the market goes up.""
Lee has exposure to volatile U.S. shale oil and gas, and does not plan to reduce his investments yet, but also holds local blue-chips to balance his portfolio.
TD Ameritrade said its Asia clients sold Apple  and Tencent (HK:0700) last month, and bought Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and J.P. Morgan . Singapore s PhillipCapital said its customers, even in the 18-25 year-old bracket, were buying dividend-paying blue chips or cashing out. 
Australia s biggest retail broker, CommSec, reported a shift away from volatile stocks such as Treasury Wine Estates  and into big banks and miners.
To be sure, retail traders are still placing incredibly risky bets, such as on bankrupt car-rental company Hertz .
""I can t imagine that anyone who went to business school or works at an asset manager would buy shares in a bankrupt company,"" said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist and portfolio manager at mutual fund MFS in Boston.
""Historically, the retail investor is the last one at the party and they don t know the cops are on their way,"" he said.
But the fear of passing up a once in a lifetime chance is strong. 
""Retail investors had missed out on the long-term big rally since the 2008 global financial crisis,"" said Taye Shim, president director of Indonesia s Mirae Asset Sekuritas.
""I think they are more encouraged to not let this one pass,"" he said.

520,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/roaring-us-auto-sales-spur-jpmorganto-raise-price-targets-2207292,2020-06-19,Roaring U.S. Auto Sales Spur JPMorgan to Raise Price Targets By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. auto market is bouncing back nearly as fast as it fell, making the hope of a V-shaped recovery real.
New vehicle sales and used vehicle prices are recovering in May and June almost as fast as they declined in March and April, according to JPMorgan . “We didn’t call it, nor did we expect it, but numerous data points all suggest the U.S. auto industry is in the midst of a once fabled but clearly no longer mythical ‘V-shaped recovery,’” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a report.
That rebound prompted JPMorgan to raise its 2020 U.S. light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate (SAAR) -- a closely watched sales measure -- by one million, to 14.5 million. The figure, materially above implied estimates from IHS Automotive of 13.2 million, also pushed JPMorgan to raise earnings per share estimates for automakers and suppliers, and led to higher price targets for Tesla  Inc., General Motors Co . and  Ferrari NV  .

“The comeback in sales and prices has been faster than most anyone presumed,” Brinkman said. “And because the shutdown of production lasted as long as it did amidst the more resilient than expected demand, inventories are now lean (even sparse), supporting an even sharper rebound in production, which comes as a relief to the entire supply chain.”

Brinkman prefers General Motors to Ford because of its greater geographic exposure to North America and China, as a percentage of total sales. In addition, General Motors offers a “superior margin and [free cash flow] profile.” The analyst raised the price target on GM to $33 from $29, and repeated an overweight rating on the shares. At the same time, Brinkman raised his price-target on the neutral-rated Ford, citing a chance that the shares may look more attractive in the second half as liquidity concerns fade.
Tesla’s price target was also raised, to $275 from $240, though Brinkman continues to rate the stock underweight due to rich valuations. Ferrari’s price target was raised to $145 from $133 following a better-than-expected recovery in sales after a Covid-19-induced slump. JPMorgan maintained its neutral rating on Ferrari, also citing valuations.

With the advent of autonomous driving, carmakers have been forced to link up radar, camera and ultrasonic sensors and connect them to braking and steering components, something which requires thousands of lines of software code.
""There is a race to create automotive operating systems. We are seeing that many non-automotive players are building up competence in this area,"" Senger told Reuters. 
By 2025, VW wants to increase its own share of software development on its cars to 60%, from 10% at present, and to design the electronics and vehicle architecture as well.
Volkswagen board member Thomas Ulbrich said in March that U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla  has a 10-year start on rivals when it comes to building electric cars and software.
""In future there will likely be fewer automotive operating systems than carmakers,"" Senger explained.
Volkswagen will define the core operating system but may seek an open source approach to enhance elements of it.
""The operating system is not something that we will control on our own. We will define its core and then quickly include open-source components, to create standards. This will create opportunities for partnerships,"" Senger said. 
Adopting an open-source approach to development with external partners is a new approach, Senger said. ""This is almost unimaginable for traditional carmakers. But this is the key breakthrough opportunity.""
In January, Volkswagen launched Car.Software, an independent unit responsible for developing lines of code, with around 3,000 digital experts and a budget of more than 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion). By 2025 it wants to have more than 10,000 software experts.
Senger said it has received many inquires from other carmakers about whether they can participate in the project.
""We are in the process of looking at the opportunities,"" Senger said, adding that Volkswagen wants to create a new system, rather than integrate legacy software from rivals.

""This will filter out many who are not willing to do this,"" Senger said about potential partners."

China has some of the world s strictest rules regarding the production of fossil-fuel vehicles, as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded cities.
Those rules have pushed both domestic and international automakers including Tesla Inc  and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) to spend billions of dollars on the development and production of new energy vehicles (NEVs), such as all-electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Plug-in hybrid technology differs from that of petrol-electric hybrid vehicles.
Automakers in China are obliged to manufacture NEVs to win ""points"" to make up for a portion of the negative points they incur when they produce internal combustion engine vehicles.
However, the system has been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve petrol cars  efficiency.
The policy published on Monday by China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology allows automakers to gradually make more petrol-electric hybrids and less of the more costly all-electric vehicles from 2021 through 2023.
Such hybrids would still be considered fossil-fuelled but re-classified as ""low fuel consumption passenger vehicles"". Significantly, the number of negative points incurred for making petrol-electric hybrids will be less than for petrol-only vehicles.
That could see more of those traditionally powered vehicles replaced with petrol-electric hybrids, experts and industry officials said, because when automakers produce those hybrids, they would not have as many negative points to make up for.
Experts have said the beneficiaries of such change would include global petrol-electric hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267), as well as Chinese makers Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (SS:601238) and supplier Hunan Corun New Energy Co Ltd (SS:600478).

China hopes NEVs will account for around a quarter of all vehicles sold in the country by 2025."

The battery event, which Musk has touted as being ""one of the most of exciting days in Tesla s history"", was previously scheduled for May, while the shareholder meeting was due on July 7.
Tesla said in a regulatory filing on Monday it was postponing the shareholder meeting ""due to continuing restrictions on in-person gatherings imposed by the relevant governmental authorities.""  
The company did not confirm the Sept. 15 date in the filing, but attached an image of Musk s tweet from Sunday night and said it will announce details, including the date, location and format at a later date.
The Battery Day will include a tour of the company s cell production system, Musk tweeted, without elaborating.  
Tesla and China s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (SZ:300750) are jointly developing batteries designed to last a million miles of use and enable electric Teslas to sell profitably for the same price or less than a gasoline vehicle, people familiar with the plans have said.
With a global fleet of more than 1 million electric vehicles that are capable of connecting to and sharing power with the grid, Tesla s goal is to achieve the status of a power company, competing with such traditional energy providers as Pacific Gas & Electric (A:PCG_pa) and Tokyo Electric Power (T:9501), those sources said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group and LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) are considering establishing an electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing joint venture in Indonesia, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The investment size and production capacity have not been decided, the person said, declining to be identified as discussions are private.
Global automakers are moving to secure batteries in anticipation of a rise in EV sales due to government subsidies and quotas designed to cut carbon emissions.
In recent years, LG Chem has set up ventures with General Motors Co  and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175). LG Chem also supplies batteries to automakers including Hyundai and Tesla Inc .
LG Group Chairman Koo Kwang-mo met Hyundai Motor Group Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung on Monday to discuss cooperation in EV batteries, including future technology.
LG Chem and Hyundai Motor Group confirmed the meeting but said nothing had been decided concerning a potential venture.
""Hyundai Motor Group is collaborating with LG Chem on various projects. However, no concrete discussion has been made on a battery joint venture in Indonesia,"" Hyundai said in a statement to Reuters.
A battery cell joint venture would be the first for Hyundai, viewed as a relative latecomer to the EV market. It is mounting a challenge to the dominance of Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) in Southeast Asia, with a new factory in Indonesia which may produce electric vehicles.
""Indonesia is committed to promoting the EV industry, but, consumer-wise, the country s not yet ready with charging infrastructure or consumer purchasing power,"" said Eugene Investment & Securities analyst Lee Jae-il. ""A battery joint venture is likely a mid- or longer-term plan.""
Indonesia s Coordinating Ministry of Maritime and Investment Affairs has heard of discussions between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Chem, said spokesman Jodi Mahardi, adding the companies have met with the government but have not shared further details.

""Hyundai has taken LG to meet a number of domestic companies to explore a potential partnership for EV battery production,"" he said."

The two companies’ brands were absent from Cars.com’s top 10 last year but stood out in the 2020 version of automotive site’s “American-Made Index.” Ford’s pickup and Tesla’s Model S, X and 3 all made their debut in the annual study.
“Tesla’s participation is one of the major developments this year,” said Kelsey Mays, senior editor of Cars.com. The electric-car maker fared well because it uses a lot of U.S.-sourced drivetrain components, and its U.S. vehicle assembly employs many workers, she said.
Honda Motor Co. matched Tesla with three vehicles in the top 10, but that was down from five last year. Honda’s Odyssey minivan, Ridgeline pickup and Passport SUV all are made in Lincoln, Alabama. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Jeep Cherokee took the No. 2 slot, dropping one place. General Motors Co .’s Chevrolet Corvette was another repeat top-10 finisher, joined by the Chevy Colorado mid-size truck at No. 10.
The ranking is based on five criteria Cars.com has said aren’t equally weighed, including assembly location, parts sourcing as determined by the American Automobile Labeling Act, factory employment relative to sales and sourcing of engines and transmissions. Of the roughly 350 new vehicles on the market in the U.S., 91 qualified for inclusion in the index.
More than two-thirds of American consumers who responded to a May survey said they considered U.S. economic impact when shopping for a vehicle, according to Cars.com, essentially unchanged from last year. But 37% of respondents said the coronavirus outbreak will make them more likely to purchase a U.S.-made model, with just 4% replying they will be less likely to do so.
Domestic parts content also will become increasingly important under a new trade agreement the U.S. struck last year with Canada and Mexico to replace Nafta. Under President Donald Trump’s renegotiated deal, automakers must raise North American content to avoid tariffs. They also must abide by tighter minimum-wage standards for workers.

Automakers including Tesla, Ford, Honda and Fiat Chrysler will have an easier time meeting the new standards under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement than manufacturers that don’t build as many of their cars where they sell them, Mays said.
The new USMCA rules are set to go into effect July 1, but the U.S. is giving automakers five years to meet key requirements.

Investing.com -- President Trump contradicts his most hawkish trade advisor, saying the U.S.-China trade deal is still ""fully intact"". Peter Navarro meanwhile walked back his comments to Fox that it s ""over"". Purchasing manager indexes in Europe point to a better-than-expected stabilization after the pandemic and the same firm puts out a survey for the U.S. later. There s also data on new home sales and surveys from Redbook Research and the Richmond Fed. Stocks are set to open higher, but there could be a question mark over Tesla  after a fatal accident in Germany that may have involved its Autopilot future, while oil prices hit their highest since March 3 on growing confidence in the demand outlook. Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, June 23rd.
1. This Chinese trade deal is not dead, it s resting          
The U.S.’s trade deal with China is fraying. Trade advisor Peter Navarro told Fox News late on Monday that the deal was “over”, in a conversation that had previously mentioned Chinese backsliding on pledges to buy U.S. farm products and the general deterioration in Chinese-U.S. relations over recent months due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the situation in Hong Kong.
President Donald Trump had responded via Twitter that ““The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!”
The deal, signed in January, was the pretext for suspending tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports in a move that appeared aimed at sparing U.S. consumers further pain in an election year.
2. Europe PMIs point to stronger than expected rebound
There was fresh evidence that Europe’s economy is stabilizing after the sharp drop in output due to lockdown measures in March and April.
HIS Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index for the euro zone recovered to 47.5 in June from 31.9 in May, reflecting a big upward swing in output expectations and in business confidence. Indexes for France and the U.K. even made it above the 50 line that typically denotes growth.
However, the overall eurozone number indicates that the economy is still contracting, if at a slower pace. As such, it’s more reflective of a tick- or swoosh-shaped recovery than a V-shaped one.
That didn’t stop European stock markets from rallying to their highest in two weeks, Germany’s DAX rising 2.5% and the Stoxx 600 rising 1.5%.
3. Stocks set to open higher
U.S. stocks are set to open higher in the wake of President Trump’s intervention on the issue of the China trade deal. Whether or not the administration feels China is living up to its commitments, the positive reaction to Trump’s tweet suggests that the market is just content that it’s not calling Beijing out on the apparent backsliding yet.
 By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures was up 226 points or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.6%.
In focus later will be T-Mobile , against the backdrop of Softbank’s decision to sell down its stake in the company following the merger with Sprint, a Softbank  portfolio company. Tesla stock may also attract scrutiny after another fatal crash in Germany that raised suspicions that its Autopilot software may have malfunctioned.
4. U.S. PMI, new home sales, Richmond Fed survey due
After the strong European numbers, IHS Markit will also publish a PMI for the U.S. at 9:45 AM ET (1345).  While the survey isn’t as closely followed as the Institute of Supply Management’s, the two are rarely far apart in their findings.
In addition, there will be an update on the retail sector from Redbook Research at 8:55 AM, and May’s numbers for new home sales at 10 AM. The latter will be released at the same time as the Richmond Fed’s regional business survey.
5. Oil hits highest since March 3 on PMIs; API eyed
Crude oil prices hit their highest level in over three and a half months, after the China news and the European PMIs reassured traders about the future trajectory of global demand.
By 6:30, U.S. crude futures were up 1.7% at $41.44 a barrel, only marginally below the intraday high of $41.56 that was the highest mark since March 3. The global benchmark Brent was up 1.6% at $43.76 a barrel."

Didi is developing autonomous driving technologies and plans to deploy so-called robotaxis in areas where there is a shortage of ride-hailing car supply, said Meng Xing, the chief operating officer of the company s autonomous driving unit, at an online conference hosted by South China Morning Post.
The company last month completed a more than $500 million fundraising round for the autonomous driving unit, led by SoftBank Group s Vision Fund 2.
Last year Didi said it would start using autonomous vehicles to pick up passengers in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen this year before expanding the scheme outside China in 2021.
Automakers and tech companies in China are investing billions in the autonomous driving industry to compete with the likes of Tesla  Inc, Alphabet  Inc Waymo and Uber Technologies .
While some industry insiders said it will take time for the public to trust autonomous vehicles fully, Meng said that Didi, which is developing autonomous cars with China s BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL], expects autonomous vehicles to be in mass production by 2025.
WeRide, a start-up based in Guangzhou city, is operating a fleet of more than 40 robotaxis plus a further 60 test cars. The three-year-old company is backed by Nissan ,  Renault   and Mitsubishi.
Baidu Inc  started offering a robotaxi service in China s southern city of Changsha this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Tuesday it had opened an investigation into 63,000 Tesla  Model S cars after reports of media-control unit failures that led to the loss of the use of touchscreens.
The auto safety agency said the preliminary evaluation, covering 2012-2015 model year vehicles, comes after it received 11 complaints alleging premature failure of the media-control unit due to memory wear-out.
A complete unit failure results in the loss of audible and visual touchscreen features, such as infotainment, navigation, and web browsing, and loss of the rear-camera image display when in reverse gear, the agency said. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NHTSA said the failure does not affect vehicle-control systems.
Tesla used the same unit in 159,000 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles built by Tesla through early 2018. 
The memory control unit uses an  Nvidia Corp   Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device, NHTSA said. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The flash devices have a finite lifespan based on the number of program or erase cycles, NHTSA said. 
Failures resulting from memory wear-out ""are likely to occur after periods of progressively degraded performance (e.g., longer power-up times, more frequent touchscreen resets, intermittent loss of cellular connectivity, loss of navigation),"" the agency said.
Some complaints said the failure could result in a loss of charging ability and that other safety alerts could be impacted. One driver said he could not clear fogged windows because he could not change climate controls. 
Another complaint said the failure disabled safety monitors associated with Tesla s driver-assistance system Autopilot.

The complaints said Tesla requires owners to pay to replace the unit once the warranty expires."
534,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/daimler-and-nvidia-team-up-to-close-tech-gap-to-tesla-2211290,2020-06-24,Daimler and Nvidia team up to close tech gap to Tesla By Reuters,"By Edward Taylor and Paul Lienert
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Having pulled ahead in the race to develop a software-based vehicle operating system, U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla  faces a new challenge from an alliance of German luxury carmaker Daimler  and U.S. computer graphics specialist Nvidia .
Daimler and Nvidia unveiled a deal on Tuesday to develop and equip the German company s Mercedes-Benz cars with a next-generation chip and software platform that could eventually be used to help vehicles drive by themselves. 
The move is a response to Tesla s ability to integrate custom designed chips with thousands of lines of code, which has allowed the Silicon Valley-based company to develop new features faster than its competitors. 
While Daimler and German rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW have criticised Tesla s aggressive marketing of its ""autopilot"" features, they have struggled to match the speed with which the U.S. carmaker brings innovations to market. 
Thanks to instantly upgradeable software, Tesla s cars boast a longer operating range and more entertainment options than rivals, even as it struggles to ramp up production. According to Volkswagen, Tesla is a decade ahead of the competition.
In a bid to narrow the gap, Mercedes, the world s oldest carmaker, has taken the unprecedented step of sharing its intellectual property with an outside tech company in exchange for access to Nvidia s computer processors and its software engineers specialised in artificial intelligence.
That s a big change from established automakers  traditional approach of trying to go it alone, or partnering with existing suppliers and manufacturers, and marks an attempt to keep up with Tesla, and deep-pocketed tech firms like Amazon  and Apple .
Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi have so far used a patchwork approach, combining vehicle platforms originally designed for combustion engine drives with electric vehicle software and components largely developed by third party suppliers.
Rather than designing a new vehicle from the ground up, German carmakers have attempted to stitch together software from suppliers of camera and radar sensors, which has made it harder to upgrade their vehicles than if they had used a comprehensive, upgradeable vehicle operating system. 
Software and processing power is gaining in importance thanks to automated driving, which requires radar, ultrasonic, camera and lidar sensors to talk to each other as well as to manage competing demands for battery power.
With zero-emission cars, electricity is not just consumed through acceleration, but also by cooling the battery, running air conditioners, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, image recognition and semi-autonomous driving functions. 
CATCHING UP 
Although Tesla started out with a similar patchwork approach, it has since adopted a strategy akin to Apple with its iPhone - it now designs computer chips and software in-house.
Like Apple, Tesla has redefined the way technologies are packaged, leaving analysts wondering whether the car sector will follow the phone industry, where profits moved from device manufacturer to producers of high-tech components and software. 
Spooked by Tesla s advance, German carmakers and major supplier Robert Bosch are retooling their businesses to accommodate ""software first"" operating systems, which rely on fewer, more powerful chips and computers. 
But they face a battle to catch up. 
Traditional carmakers have struggled to attract software engineering talent, in part because of a reticence to pay big salaries for projects without a defined business case, allowing Tesla to sustain an advantage which some analysts say is getting bigger thanks to the company s ""fleet learning."" 
Tesla collects data about battery depletion rates and driving styles from all its cars, and uses this to design new software algorithms. 
Prioritising energy consumption has allowed Tesla keep battery capacity above 90% even after 200,000-300,000 kilometres, or four to five years, UBS analysts said in a March 2019 report, attributing this to Tesla-designed software, batteries and semiconductors.
Teaming up with Nvidia could allow Daimler to take a short cut to state-of-the-art technology. 
The results won t be immediate - jointly developed Mercedes-Nvidia vehicles are not expected to hit the road until 2024. Nvidia will help Daimler develop assisted and self-driving functions, which will form part of a Mercedes-designed overall vehicle system.
Chips and processors will only become more critical as automakers race to build self-driving cars. Just one video sensor, such as Bosch’s stereo video camera, generates 100 gigabytes of data in only one kilometre of travel, making efficient processing vital to optimising vehicle range and training vehicle reflexes. 
That makes fewer, more powerful processors a must, according to Harry Kroeger, a former head of development of electronics at Daimler, a former director of Tesla and now a management board member at Bosch overseeing automotive electronics. 
""You no longer install one small box for every single function; instead you install a bigger smart box that can do many things simultaneously,” he said. 

""The computing power you need for climate control is ridiculously low compared to functions that prevent the car from crashing. A smart box prioritises the safety functions and uses its  down time  to focus on things like climate regulation."" "

General Motors   Chevrolet and Fiat Chrysler s Ram tied for the third place.
The study found most domestic brands, including Fiat Chrysler s Dodge, Ram and Jeep as well as GM s Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, ranked above average.
GM s Chevrolet Sonic achieved the best score for individual model in the study.
""Collectively, this is the best-ever performance by the Detroit automakers — when compared with the import brands — in the history of the study,"" J.D. Power said.
The consultant added that most premium brands ranked below average, as they generally equip their vehicles with complex technology, which can cause problems for some owners. 
One-fourth of all problems cited by new vehicle owners related to infotainment, including complaints about built-in voice recognition and touchscreens.
Tesla Inc  made its debut on the list with a score that suggested 250 problems per 100 vehicles. However, the electric car maker was not ranked as it did not meet the required criteria for a comparative study. 
""Unlike other manufacturers, Tesla doesn t grant us permission to survey its owners in 15 states where it is required,"" said Doug Betts, president of the automotive division at J.D. Power.

The study found that GM s plant in China, which makes the Buick Envision, was building vehicles with the fewest defects or malfunctions."

""The fact that retail sales - not fleet - are what kept the market propped up speaks volumes to the resilience of the American consumer,"" Edmunds  executive director of insights Jessica Caldwell said in a statement. 
The shutdown of plants and auto dealers hit the U.S. auto sector hard in April and May, but assembly plants reopened starting May 18 and have since boosted production while sales have rebounded as states reopen economies.
TrueCar  subsidiary ALG expects sales of new cars and trucks to drop 24%, with the month finishing with a annual sales rate of 13 million units, down from 17.2 million last year. Excluding fleet sales, retail deliveries will decline 15%, but rise 1.5% from May. 
With inventories lower, availability of some vehicles, especially pickup trucks made by General Motors Co ,  Ford Motor Co   and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV  , could suffer, analysts said. 
Tesla Inc s  build-to-order model means the electric carmaker will see a big decline in June sales, analysts said. 
Edmunds expects June sales to drop 29% from last year but only 3.6% from May. It expects an annual sales rate of 12.8 million vehicles.
As inventories dwindle and automakers pull back on incentives, the industry needs to prepare for uncertainties ahead, Caldwell said.
Cox Automotive sees June sales dropping 30% with an annual sales rate of 12.6 million units as supply constraints may limit market gains, especially among pickups. For the full year, Cox expects new-car sales of 12.9 million.

""The worst of the crisis is probably behind us,"" Cox senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said on a conference call."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lordstown Motors Corp unveiled its future electric pickup truck at an event on Thursday as the startup seeks to begin producing vehicles at a former General Motors  factory in northeastern Ohio.
Lordstown Motors, which hopes to start delivering the electric pickup to customers by January 2021, will face significant competition from other automakers.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was driven on stage in the pre-production Endurance vehicle on Thursday in the politically important state. 
""After a heartbreaking day in 2019, to see this kind of a comeback - I hope you see it s a testament to the confidence the people of this company have in the people of this community,"" Pence said. ""It s a nice ride. I m a truck guy.""
Also on Thursday, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co announced a strategic relationship with Lordstown Motors and said it would acquire new Endurance vehicles for its fleet.
Lordstown Chief Executive Steve Burns said the company would ""beat everyone to market"" with the first EV truck. Pence said Lordstown has presold 14,000 vehicles.
The sprawling GM plant s fate became a political lightning rod after the largest U.S. automaker announced its planned closure in November 2018, drawing condemnation from President Donald Trump and many U.S. lawmakers. 
On Thursday, the campaign of Trump s presumptive Democratic rival in the November election, former Vice President Joe Biden, said ""Trump and GM abandoned Ohio’s union workers."" The campaign cited a 2017 Trump speech in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, in which Trump said jobs were ""all coming back” and urged residents: “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.""
As recently as 2016, the GM plant employed 4,500 workers. Its March 2019 closure was devastating to the area. Lordstown Motors has to date hired just 70 employees and about 100 contractors.
Lordstown Motors, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc, bought the former GM plant and equipment for $20 million as part of its ambitious plan to begin delivering electric pickup trucks to customers by year end - a goal which has since been delayed to January.
Other firms are preparing to enter the electric truck sector.
GM plans to build its first electric pickup truck in 2021. Tesla  Inc plans to start building its electric Cybertruck in 2021, while Nikola Corp plans to build an electric truck by 2022.
Electric vehicle startup Rivian plans to build an electric pickup truck starting in late 2020, while Ford Motor  Co will introduce an electric F-150 truck in 2022. 
In December, GM and South Korea’s LG Chem said they would invest $2.3 billion to build an electric vehicle battery cell joint-venture plant near the Lordstown plant."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor  Co on Thursday unveiled the next generation of its F-150 pickup in an online event, showing a truck with a familiar look but that incorporates the automaker s new strategy for profiting from software and connectivity.
The new F-150 and the soon-to-launch Mach-E electric SUV will be the first Ford vehicles equipped with electronic systems that allow for extensive over-the-air software upgrades. Rival Tesla  Inc pioneered the use of smartphone-style updates to improve vehicles and generate revenue long after the sale. General Motors Co  has launched comparable technology on several vehicles.
Now the F-150, part of the best-selling line of vehicles in the United States with annual sales equivalent to Tesla s current volume, will bring upgradeable, fully connected vehicle technology to the mainstream market. Ford will offer a hybrid version of the F-150. An electric model is expected within two years.
The new F-150 s design does not shock like the Tesla Cybertruck, with an exterior hard to distinguish from the current model. When it launches this fall, the truck will aim for traditional buyers in the U.S. heartland, down to the American flag stamped into the dashboard.
However, customers who opt to pay for it will be able to download software to enable hands-free driving on highways when it becomes available next year, Ford said. Commercial customers will be offered software that can help with routing or tracking vehicles in a fleet. 
Ford s chief operating officer, Jim Farley, said in an interview that after-sale software upgrades for customers may not be the biggest benefit the company gets from connecting F-series trucks to the cloud. Connected F-150s can tell Ford when there s a problem with engine control software, and enable a quick fix. 
""It’s a gamechanger for us,"" Farley said. The time to detect a warranty problem ""goes from weeks and months to days and hours."" 
Ford will also be able to know what features customers use and how, and what equipment could be safely omitted to cut costs. ""We don t have to guess anymore,"" he said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Cobalt prices are at 10-month lows due to sagging demand from the electric vehicle and aerospace sectors amid the COVID-19 pandemic and look likely to slide further as airlines defer maintenance.
Airlines such as Australia s Qantas , Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines  are looking to defer plane deliveries from Airbus  and Boeing  and this means postponed demand for cobalt and nickel alloys used in jet turbine blades.
Graphic: Cobalt demand from aerospace, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/nmopajjjrva/Aerospace%20cobalt%20demand.PNG
But this is only part of the story.
""The harsh high temperature and pressure environments of the jet engine necessitates regular replacement of turbine blades,"" said CRU analyst George Heppel. ""But planes are grounded, turbine blades aren t being used and don t need replacing.""
Heppel expects cobalt demand for aerospace rotating parts to total 4,442 tonnes this year, a drop of 18% from 2019 and the lowest since 2011. Overall, he forecasts a 6,300 tonne surplus this year and global consumption at 131,800 tonnes. 
Graphic: Cobalt market balance, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnpwwwwqpw/Cobalt%20market%20balance.PNG
Prices of cobalt metal, at around $30,000 a tonne, are down more than 15% since early February and are the lowest since last August. As surpluses become more visible lower levels are expected.
Graphic: Cobalt prices, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/azgvorrkwpd/Cobalt%20prices.PNG
Roskill analyst Ying Lu said recent price convergence between higher grade cobalt metal used for alloys and standard grade was a signal of weak demand from the aerospace sector. She expects a relatively balanced market this year compared with a 10,000 tonne surplus last year.
    ""The pandemic has affected demand and supply. Cobalt mined from (Democratic Republic of) Congo is typically exported for refining through Durban in South Africa, where there was lockdown (to halt the spread of the new coronavirus), which created logistical disruptions."" 
Cobalt from the DRC comes in the form of hydroxide, which is turned into chemicals for the lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles. Much of it goes to China, which dominates the supply chain for electric vehicle batteries.
Falling sales of electric vehicles in China, including by Tesla  and BYD (SZ:002594) (HK:1211) earlier this year and in the second half of last year, have also weakened cobalt consumption.

However, demand from the electric vehicle sector, which represents 20% of global demand, is expected to recover at a faster pace than from aerospace due to government incentives to promote clean air initiatives."

""Only with our own e-architecture can we fully exploit the advantages of an electric vehicle,"" Manfred Schoch told Der Spiegel magazine.
Schoch said a dedicated electric platform is needed if the German luxury carmaker is not to be overtaken by competitors from California - like electric car company Tesla  - or from China.
Spiegel said Schoch s call comes after some BMW managers have pushed for a new electric strategy internally for some time.
Those managers hope that the company will now quickly shift to develop a pure e-platform, which would make cars lighter and give them a longer battery range and a bigger interior.
Asked about the report, a BMW spokesman said the company was currently ""optimally positioned"" and declined to comment on speculation about internal discussions.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday and were on course to end the week down, after a rise in new Covid-19 cases and a blast from the Federal Reserve reminded investors of the obstacles to a quick recovery.
The Fed had announced the results of its annual stress tests late on Thursday and had ordered banks not to buy back stock in the third quarter and capped their dividend payouts, aiming to ensure that they strong enough to absorb up to $700 billion in loan losses as a result of the pandemic.
As such, bank shares led the two old-economy indexes lower on Friday. Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan , Bank of America  and  Wells Fargo   stock all fell by between 4% and 5%.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 291 points, or 1.1% at 25,454 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite – unburdened by large-cap banks – was also down 0.8%.
The day s biggest gainer was Gap , which soared 33% after announcing a ""multi-year"" partnership with rapper Kanye West to sell a Yeezy line of clothing, offering items such as hoodies, basics, T-shirts and joggers The new line is expected to appear in Gap stores and on Gap.com in 2021, the two parties said. West will keep sole ownership of the Yeezy brand.
After losing over 80% of its value since the start of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018, Gap stock has now nearly doubled from its March low, on hopes that it may escape the general apocalypse engulfing Main Street retail.
Earlier, the market was left cold by numbers showing that personal spending rebounded by a record 8.2% in May - albeit that was short of expectations of a 9% increase after the equally-record-breaking 12% drop in April. The rise is unlikely to be sustained due to the continuing high level of unemployment: jobless claims only just dipped below 20 million two weeks ago, according to data released on Thursday by the Labor Department.
Elsewhere, Tesla  stock fell 0.4% amid reports that the company had terminated two employees for failing to return to work as its Fremont factory reopened, even though it had previously given them leave to remain at home. Tesla was reported as saying it couldn t contact the employees in question.

545,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nikolas-surge-puts-power-in-company-hands-to-force-warrant-call-2213551,2020-06-26,Nikola’s Surge Puts Power in Company Hands to Force Warrant Call By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- As Nikola Corp  watchers wait to see how many pre-orders the company can rack up for its Badger pickup truck, a different countdown is set to begin for investors.
The upstart company trying to compete with the likes of Tesla  Inc. filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission early last week. When that filing is declared effective, a timeline will be set in motion that would allow Nikola to force investors to redeem outstanding public warrants early. The registration, declaration of effectiveness and forced early redemption are events with the potential to weigh on shares -- building tension between the company and warrant holders, and drawing a taut line between Nikola fans and short-sellers.
Attention on Nikola has been intense with its stock more than doubling since its merger with blank-check acquisition vehicle VectoIQ on June 4. The shares are a particular darling of the commission-free day-trading set, raising questions about how much of its quirky structure is understood by newly minted retail stock dabblers.
Shares of Nikola have “taken on a life of their own,” said George Kaufman, investment banking head at Chardan Capital Markets. “Volatility in the shares isn’t related to fundamental changes in the business.”
One lens into the pressures surrounding the stock focuses on publicly traded warrants that were a part of equity units sold at VectoIQ’s public debut. Once a registration statement governing the warrants is declared effective, it becomes possible for holders to give the company $11.50 to get one Nikola share. The stock opened at $72.09 on Friday.
Trading freely at $36, and incorporating the $11.50 exercise price, owning a warrant would seem to leave a lot of potential profit with shares trading at around $70. The gap between the two shows the stock’s stomach-churning volatility and the risk something happens to it between now and when the warrants are exercised.
The prospect of the warrants being declared effective may be one of the factors behind that gap. Already skittish after such a powerful rally, Nikola holders have shown themselves sensitive to the potential for fresh stock to hit the market.
Investors should expect a “near-term pull-back,” as the price discovery process is underway and the volatility seen in shares following its SPAC merger is “illustrative of the challenges involved,” JPMorgan  analyst Paul Coster said in an initiation report earlier this week. Coster has a neutral rating on shares and a price target of $45.
“In the very short term, we believe registration of the SPAC Warrants could lead to sale of about 30 million shares, and share registration should enable shorts to borrow stock, countering the effect of recent retail accumulation,” he said.
Wariness of that risk was on display in after-hours trading on June 15 when the registration statement was filed and shares fell as much as 12%, prompting founder and CEO Trevor Milton to explain on Twitter. That selloff was immediately reversed, with shares trading higher again within an hour.
As of Thursday, the registration statement had not been declared effective. The prospectus registered up to 23,890,000 shares of common stock underlying both public and private warrants. Nikola currently has 360.9 million shares outstanding, with about a third of that freely available to trade.
A company spokeswoman declined an emailed request to comment.
While bears have spent a lot of ink warning of the implicit danger of the warrant exercise, the possibility of it happening has never been a secret. Nikola’s shares have sat securely above $60 for nearly three weeks, even as discussion of possible dilution became common in chatrooms and other places where retail investors congregate.
Complicating matters, when the registration is declared effective, an event called a forced cash call can come into play, Chardan’s Kaufman said. If common shares close above $18 for 20 days within a 30-day period, Nikola can force warrant holders to pay $11.50 in cash per warrant in exchange for one share of common stock or surrender their warrants for essentially nothing.
“Short-sellers saw some relief and long-only investors saw some potential risk in the S-1 filing, believing the SEC would declare it effective quickly,” Kaufman said. “In most cases, the filing and the effectiveness of said filing can put downward pressure on shares, which may not be temporary.” Chardan was among the underwriters of the VectoIQ SPAC IPO that resulted in Nikola.
In effect, the sustained rally in Nikola shares puts power in the company’s hands to call the warrants once the SEC green-lights its registration statement and hurdles are met.
“Generally, a holder would want to hang onto the warrant rather than exercising it, so the ability to force the exercise is a pro-issuer provision,” Carol Anne Huff, co-head of Arnold & Porter’s capital markets transactions practice, said.
From Nikola’s perspective, a forced cash warrant exercise would give the company an injection of additional capital, but a short squeeze could make that kind of forced redemption trickier to pull off. Stock borrow fees spiked to a high of more than 700% last week due to a lack of shares to loan out, S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky said. And shares remain at lofty levels. Those who are hedging their warrants would be short the underlying common shares.
If shares continue to run, the company could alternatively force holders to exchange the warrants for a reduced number of shares without requiring a cash payment, or just leave the warrants out there. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic Holdings  Inc., whose shares also shot skyward after its public debut via a SPAC merger, did a cashless redemption. Virgin’s warrant holders received 0.5073 of a common share for each warrant surrendered.
Nikola can decide to take the dilution for no cash, which could result in warrant holders who fully hedged their position being short more shares than they would receive upon a cashless exercise. This could result in them having to top up in the public markets, exacerbating any short-squeeze, Kaufman said.
That would also open up the possibility for an additional equity offering, which, assuming shares stay aloft, could fetch more cash per share.
“Why use the cash call when there is a battleground between the shorts and longs, with the shorts losing? That’s a fair question,” Kaufman said. “This could be one of the instances where not forcing the cash out of these warrants has merit, but that would be a middle finger to warrant holders, many of whom are or were regular shareholders before the run-up.”"
546,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-uschina-feud-quietly-gets-nasty-2214604,2020-06-28,The U.S.-China Feud Quietly Gets Nasty By Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China are moving beyond bellicose trade threats to exchanging regulatory punches that threaten a wide range of industries including technology, energy and air travel.
The two countries have blacklisted each other’s companies, barred flights and expelled journalists. The quietly unfolding skirmish is starting to make companies nervous the trading landscape could shift out from under them.
“There are many industries where U.S. companies have made long-term bets on China’s future because the market is so promising and so big,” said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s head of international affairs. Now, they’re “recognizing the risk.”
China will look to avoid measures that could backfire, said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to the nation’s cabinet and a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. Any sanctions on U.S. companies would be a “last resort” because China “is in desperate need of foreign investment from rich countries for both economic and political reasons.”
Pressure is only expected to intensify ahead of the U.S. elections in November, as President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden joust over who will take a tougher line on China.
Trump has blamed China for covering up the coronavirus pandemic he has mocked as “Kung Flu,” accused Beijing of “illicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets” and threatened the U.S. could pursue a “complete decoupling” from the country.
Biden, likewise, has described President Xi Jinping as a thug, labeled mass detention of Uighur Muslims as unconscionable and accused China of predatory trade practices.
And on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats have found rare unity in their opposition to China, with lawmakers eager to take action against Beijing for its handling of Covid-19, forced technology transfers, human rights abuses and its tightening grip on Hong Kong.
“China is going to be a punching bag in the campaign,” said Capital Alpha Partners’ Byron Callan. “But China is a punching bag that can punch back.”
China has repeatedly rejected U.S. accusations over its handling of the pandemic, Uighurs, Hong Kong and trade, and it has fired back at the Trump administration for undermining global cooperation and seeking to start a “new cold war.” Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month said China has no interest in replacing the U.S. as a hegemonic power, while adding that the U.S. should give up its “wishful thinking” of changing China.
Both countries have already taken a series of regulatory moves aimed at protecting market share.
The U.S. is citing security concerns in blocking China Mobile  Ltd., the world’s largest mobile operator, from entering the U.S. market. It’s culling Chinese-made drones from government fleets and discouraging the deployment of Chinese transformers on the power grid. The Trump administration has also tried to constrain the global reach of China’s Huawei Technologies Co., the world’s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer.
Meanwhile, China prevented U.S. airline flights into the country for more than two months and, after the U.S. imposed visa restrictions on Chinese journalists, it expelled American journalists. It has stepped up its scrutiny of U.S. companies, with China’s state news agency casting one probe as a warning to the White House. China also has long made it difficult for U.S. telecommunications companies to enter its market, requiring overseas operators to co-invest with local firms and requiring authorization by the central government.
One of the most combustible flashpoints has been the Trump administration’s campaign to contain Huawei by seeking to limit the company’s business in the U.S. and push allies to shun its gear in their networks.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission moved to block devices made by Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763). from being used in U.S. networks. And the Commerce Department has placed Huawei on blacklists aimed at preventing the Chinese company from using U.S. technology for the chips that power its network gear, including tech from suppliers Qualcomm  Inc. and Broadcom  Inc.
After suppliers found work-arounds, Commerce in May tightened rules to bar any chipmaker using American equipment from selling to Huawei without U.S. approval. The step could constrain virtually the entire contract chipmaking industry, which uses equipment from U.S. vendors such as Applied Materials Inc .,  Lam Research Corp  . and KLA Corp. in wafer fabrication plants. The curbs also threaten to cripple Huawei. Although the company can buy off-the-shelf or commodity mobile chips from a third party such as Samsung Electronics  Co. or MediaTek Inc., going that route would force it to make costly compromises on performance in basic products.
Huawei was on a list the Pentagon unveiled last week of companies it says are owned or controlled by China’s military, opening them to increased scrutiny.
China has raised the specter of reprisal.
After the new restrictions were announced, the editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper tweeted that China would retaliate using an “unreliable entities list” that it first threatened at the height of the trade war last year. Although China didn’t identify companies on the list, the Global Times has cited a source close to the Chinese government as saying U.S. bellwethers such as Apple Inc . and Qualcomm could be targeted.
The fallout could extend to companies heavily reliant on Chinese supply chains, as well consumer-facing brands eager to expand sales in Asia. Boeing  Co., which recorded $5.7 billion of revenue from China in 2019, and Tesla  Inc., the biggest U.S. carmaker operating independently in China, are among companies most exposed if relations sour further.
“We’re playing in a much wider field now,” said Jim Lucier, managing director of research firm Capital Alpha Partners. “We’re not simply talking about ‘you tariff me’ and ‘I tariff you.’ The playing field is virtually unlimited.”
Planes and Automobiles
U.S. automakers have also been singed. In June, China fined Ford Motor  Co.’s main joint venture in the country for antitrust violations, saying Changan Ford Automobile Co. had restricted retailers’ sale prices since 2013.
Aviation has been another source of tension, as both countries squabble over access to their skies. China’s decision to limit U.S. airlines operations to those services scheduled as of March 12 hurt carriers such as United Airlines Holdings  Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc , and American Airlines  Group Inc. that had suspended passenger flights to and from China because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. responded earlier this month by initially threatening to ban all flights from China, then relenting to allow two flights weekly once Chinese officials eased their restrictions. Now, in what appears to be a staged de-escalation, China gave U.S. passenger carriers permission to operate four weekly flights to the country and earlier this month, the Trump administration matched the move by also authorizing four flights from Chinese airlines.
It’s happening outside of aviation too. Consider the U.S. government’s decision to seize a half-ton, Chinese-made electrical transformer when it arrived at an American port last year and divert the gear to a national lab instead of the Colorado substation where it was supposed to be deployed. That move -- and a May executive order from Trump authorizing the blockade of electric grid gear supplied by “foreign adversaries” of the U.S. in the name of national security -- have already sent shock waves through the power sector.
The effect has been to dissuade American utilities from buying Chinese equipment to replace aging components in the nation’s electrical grid, said Jim Cai, the U.S. representative for Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Co., the company whose delivery was seized. Although Cai said the firm has supplied parts to private utilities and government-run grid operators in the U.S. for nearly 15 years without security complaints, at least one American utility has since canceled a transformer award to the company, Cai said.
Trump’s directive is tied to a broader effort to bring more manufacturing to the U.S. from China. “This is a part of the administration’s efforts to impair China’s supply chains into the United States,” said former White House adviser Mike McKenna.
Escalating tensions could jeopardize the U.S. economic recovery as well as China’s trade commitment to purchase $200 billion in American goods and services. Trump declared on Twitter last week that the pact “is fully intact,” adding: “Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!”Last week, Trump tweeted “The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!”
It may also affect the November presidential election. Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton alleges in a new book that Trump asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping to help him win re-election by buying more farm products -- a claim the White House has dismissed as untrue.
“I don’t expect one single blow to send this relationship in a tailspin,” the chamber’s Brilliant said. “Each side will calibrate their reactions in a way that will not tip the scales too far.”
Take the recent spat over media access. After the U.S. designated five Chinese media companies as “foreign missions,” China revoked press credentials for three Wall Street Journal staff members over an article with a headline describing China as the “real sick man of Asia.”
Then the Trump administration ordered Chinese state-owned news outlets to slash staff working in the U.S. Beijing responded in March by effectively expelling more than a dozen U.S. journalists working in China.
Both the U.S. and China have ample opportunities to ratchet up regulatory pressure. A bill passed by the Senate last month could prompt the delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges if American officials aren’t allowed to review their financial audits.
And last week, as the U.S. State Department imposed visa bans on Chinese Communist Party officials accused of infringing the freedom of Hong Kong citizens, a senior official made clear the move was just an opening salvo in a campaign to force Beijing to back off new restrictions on the city.
China, similarly, can slow licensing decisions and regulatory approvals, launch investigations under its anti-monopoly law and squeeze financial firms that want to do business in the country. For instance, the country could rescind pledges to let U.S. financial firms take controlling stakes in Chinese investment banking joint ventures, according to a Cowen analyst.
“China will not make any significant compromise and will retaliate whenever and wherever possible,” Shi, the Renmin University professor, said.
Companies are still lured to China and its massive local market -- and tensions with the U.S. don’t overcome the Asian superpower’s appeal. Just one-fifth of companies surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce in China late last year said they had moved or were considering moving some operations outside of the country, part of a three-year downward trend.
But the coronavirus pandemic has subsequently pushed more companies to reckon with the risks of relying too heavily on any single country for their supply chains, amid existing concerns about forced technology transfers, cost and rising tensions that could damp investment in China.
China is no longer the lowest-cost manufacturer, and companies are more reluctant to invest there, said James Lewis, director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“Everyone would like to be in the China market -- everyone wants it to be like 2010 -- but things are changing.”

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc  chief Elon Musk in an internal email called on employees to work hard to allow the electric car maker to break even in the second quarter despite the coronavirus pandemic.
The rallying cry has become a familiar theme in recent quarters at Tesla, with Musk calling on employees to quickly build and deliver vehicles at the end of the quarter to achieve specific targets.
""Breaking even is looking super tight. Really makes a difference for every car you build and deliver. Please go all out to ensure victory!"" Musk wrote in the Monday email seen by Reuters.
Electric vehicle site Electrek first reported the news. Tesla shares rose 5.2% to close at $1,009.35 on the Nasdaq on Monday.
The automaker is expected to report second-quarter delivery numbers this week. 
Analysts on average expect the company to deliver roughly 74,000 vehicles in the months from April to June, according to Refinitiv data.
Much of the United States was under some form of lockdown orders during that time, which caused auto sales to plummet. 
Tesla in April surprised investors when it said production and delivery of its new sport utility vehicle, Model Y, was significantly ahead of schedule despite the virus outbreak. The company delivered 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter.

Production at Tesla s only U.S. vehicle factory in California was shut down for more than six weeks from the end of March to early May due to local lockdown orders aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, ahead of another key session of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12 points or 0.1% at 25,583 points. TheS&P 500 was up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
Trading is expected to be influenced by quarter-end window dressing, at the end of stocks’ best quarter in over a decade – although that performance is overwhelmingly due to the collapse in the first quarter that was stemmed by massive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. The market was left cold as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index rebounded by less than expected in June, to a level of only 36.6. 
The threat of fresh lockdown measures in the U.S. also refuses to go away, as a surge in new cases across the South and West led Dr. Anne Schuchart, the principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to say on Monday that the virus is spreading too quickly and too broadly to be brought under control. Various counties in California and Florida have already said their beaches will remain closed over the July 4th weekend.
Among individual stocks, Boeing  fell 4.2% after  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA   canceled an order for 97 aircraft, almost all of which was accounted for by the 737 MAX. Uber  stock rose 3.8% after reports that it s in talks to buy meal delivery service Postmates for around $2.6 billion.
 Exxon Mobil   stock fell 2.1% to its lowest in six weeks on concerns that it will have to write billions of dollars off the value of its assets. Rival major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) earlier Tuesday said it would take impairments of up to $22 billion in the second quarter to reflect expectations of lower oil and gas prices for the next three years, following a path already beaten by BP , Chevron  , Hess  and Occidental .
Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) ADRs were down 4.3%. U.S. Crude oil prices, which were also knocked by Shell s update, were down 0.6% at $39.45 a barrel.
Elsewhere, Tesla   stock hit a new all-time high, rising 2.7% after an internal e-mail was leaked in which founder and CEO Elon Musk still held out hope that the company - which has a valuation of $187 billion - would break even in the three months to June.

Xilinx  jumped 6.3% after raising its fiscal first-quarter revenue guidance. The company said it now expected revenue of $720 million to $734 million, after previously guiding revenue in a range of $660 million to $720 million.
Lam Research , NVIDIA  and Advanced Micro Devices  were also among the biggest gainers, pushing the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up more than 2%.
Energy, however, lagged the move higher in the broader market, paced by a 1% fall in oil prices settled as worries over crude demand persisted.
