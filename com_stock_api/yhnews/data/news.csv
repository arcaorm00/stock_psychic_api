The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 0.43%.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&amp;P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily.

This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on ADepending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 84.08 in the Diagnostics & Research industry, Agilent Technologies Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 44.68.

258b9bfa-d87e-3562-b345-052492a5556a;A;"Agilent Falls In Pre-Market As Quarterly Sales Miss; Oppenheimer Says Hold";"Shares in Agilent Technologies (A) are down in pre-market trading after third-quarter sales missed analysts’ expectations and the company said it exited July with modest growth across all major markets.The stock is declining 2.1% to $95.80 in Wednesday’s pre-market session. Agilent’s (A) third-quarter sales fell 1% to $1.26 billion and is below the $1.21 billion estimated by analysts. On an adjusted basis and excluding items, Agilent reported earnings of $243 million or $0.78 per share for the three months ended July 31. Analysts had expected the company to earn $0.66 per share.Agilent, an equipment maker which serves the life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, said that although it sees a gradual improvement in lab access for its customers and increased non-COVID-19 testing volumes, it is still not at pre-COVID-19 levels.“Under challenging conditions created by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Agilent again delivered strong results,” said Agilent CEO Mike McMullen. “While the world’s economies are expected to recover at different rates in the fourth quarter, we remain focused on growth and investing for the future, while effectively managing expenses.”Separately, Agilent announced that it will invest $150 million to expand it Colorado production facility and add manufacturing lines to more than double the current capacity for manufacturing therapeutic oligos. Oligos, which are short DNA and RNA molecules used to create nucleic acid-based therapeutics, hold the potential to be used in developing treatments for cancer, COVID-19, cardiovascular disease, rare and infectious diseases, and other conditions.The expansion plans come as Agilent expects the supplier market for therapeutic oligos to exceed $750 million in 2025 with projected double-digit annual growth over the next five years.Agilent shares have recovered after hitting a low in March and are now up 15% on a year-to-date basis. (See Agilent stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, Needham analyst Stephen Unger maintained a Hold rating following the quarterly results, saying that at the price of $97.86, A shares are trading at 27.6x the EPS estimate of $3.54 for the 12-month period ending Aug. 2021, which is within his revised target trading range of 24.0-30.0x.“Given increased upside potential with the ongoing recovery from COVID-19, we consider the upper half of the range to be fair value (share price of $96.00-$106.00),” Unger wrote in a note to investors.Overall, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic on the stock. The Moderate Buy consensus is split between 6 Hold and 5 Buys. Meanwhile, the $93.78 average analyst price target indicates downside potential of 4.2% over the coming 12 months.Related News: Walmart Delivers Earnings Triumph; E-Commerce Sales Double   Home Depot Sales Exceed Estimates As Shoppers Pile On DIY Products   Kohl’s Dips 17% As Covid-19 To Hit Back-to-School Sales More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * GFL Environment Rebukes Spruce Point’s Debt Claims; Shares Rise   * KBR To Buy Space Contractor Centauri For $800M; Shares Pop 6%   * Blackstone Set To Win Bid For Takeda’s Consumer Health Unit - Report   * Lowe’s Delivers Blowout Q2 As Online Sales Surge 135%";Wed, 19 Aug 2020 10:53:49 +0000;A_2020-08-19;0.991;-0.1531

d6709666-0dc9-3128-b0ee-6c9885fc98f6;A;Agilent's Debt Overview;Shares of Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) rose by 14.74% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Agilent Technologies has.Agilent Technologies's Debt Based on Agilent Technologies's financial statement as of June 1, 2020, long-term debt is at $1.79 billion and current debt is at $700.00 million, amounting to $2.49 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.32 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $1.16 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Agilent Technologies has $9.46 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.26. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For August 18, 2020  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
